Abstract 
A multifunctional NIA 9 environment, 
\[!'I'AI~-3, is presented. The environment has 
several NI,I ~ applications, inchtding a machine 
translation system, a natural language interface 
to SQI, type databases, synonymous 
l~araphrasing of sentences, syntactic error 
correction module, and a computer-assisted 
language learning tool. Ihnphasis is laid on a 
new naodtile of tile processor responsible for tlio 
intorl\]lcc with the Universal Networking 
l A.lllgtlagC, il roCOlll plodtlcl by the UN 
Universily inlended for the facilitation of 
nnlltihlnguage, multiethnic access 1o 
communication etworks such as WWW. The 
UNL module of ETAP-3 naturally combines the 
two major al)proaches accepted in machine 
translation: the lransfer-based approach and the 
interlingua pl)roach. 
1. In t roductory  Renmrks  
ETAP-3 is a multilmrposc NIA ~ environmmlt 
that was conceived in the 1980s and has been 
worked out in the Institute for lnl~mnation 
Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of 
Sciences (Apresian et al 1992, l?,oguslavsky 
1995). The theoretical foundation of ETAP-3 is 
tile Meaning ?=> Text linguistic theory by Igor' 
Mel'6uk and the Integral Theory of Language by 
Jurij Apresian. 
Eq'AP-3 is a non-comlnercial environment 
primarily oriented at linguistic research rather 
than creating a marketable software product. The 
main focus of the research carried ()tit with 
I';TAP-3 is COlnputational modelling of natural 
languages. This attitude explains our effort to 
develop the models in a way as linguistically 
sound as possible. We strive to incorporate into the 
system much linguistic knowledge irrespective of 
whether this knowledge is essential for better text 
processing (e.g. machine translation) or not. In 
particular, we want our parser to produce what wc 
consider a correct syntactic representation of tim 
sentence - first of all because we believe that this 
interpretation is a true fact about tile natural 
language. We have had inany occasions to set that 
in the long run the iheorctical soundness and 
completeness of linguistic knowledge incorporated 
in an NIA ) application will pay. 
All NLP applications in F, TAP-3 are largely 
based on an original system of three-wdue logic 
and use an original formal language of linguistic 
descriptions, I~'Oi>&;T. 
2. ETAP-3 :  Modules,  Features,  Des ign ,

2.11 ETAP-3  Modules  
The m~tjor NI,P modules of ETAP-3 are as 
lollows:

? Natural Language Interface to SQL Type 
Databases 
? System of Synonymous Paraphrasing of 
Sentences

Fundamental Research, whose assistance isgratefully acknowledged. 
83 
by the UN University, is discussed in detail in 
Section 3. 
2.1.1. ETAP-3 MT System 
The most important module of ETAP-3 is 
the MT system that serves five language pairs: 
(1) English-Russian, (2) Russian - English, (3) 
Russian - Korean. (4) Russian - French, and (5) 
Russian - German. 
By far the most advanced are the first two 
of these pairs. The system disposes of 50,000- 
strong so-called combinatorial dictionaries of 
Russian and English that contain syntactic, 
derivational, semantic, subcategorization, and 
collocational information. The system relies on 
comprehensive grammars of the two languages. 
For the other language pairs smaller scale 
prototypes are available. 
ETAP-3 is able to present multiple 
translations when it encounters an ambiguity it 
cannot resolve. By default, the system produces 
one parse and one translation that it considers 
the most probable. If the user opts for multiple 
translation, the system remembers the 
unresolved ambiguities and provides all 
mutuany compatible parses and lexical choices. 
To give one example from the real output: the 
sentence They made a general remark that . . . .  
when submitted to the multiple translation 
option, yielded two Russian translations that 
correspond to radically different syntactic 
structures and lexical interpretations: (a) Oni 
sdelali obshchee zameehanie, chto... (= They 
made some comn-lon renlark that ...) and (b) Oni 
vynudili generala otmetit; chto... (= They forced 
some general to remark that ...). 
2.1.2. Natural Language Interface to SQL Type 
Databases 
This ETAP-3 module translates freely 
worded human queries to a database from 
Russian or English into SQL expressions. It can 
also produce the reverse generation of a NL 
query from an SQL expression. 
2.1.3. System of Synonymous Paraphrasing 
The module is designed for linguistic 
experiments in obtaining nmltiple meaning- 
retaining paraphrases of Russian and English 
sentences. The paraphrasing is based on the 
concept of lexical functions, one of the 
important innovations of the Meaning ?=> Text 
theory. The following example shows the kind 
of paraphrases that can be produced by the 
module: 
(1) The director ordered John to write a report - 
The director gave John an order to write a report 
- John was ordered by the director to write a 
report - John received an orcler fonn the director 
to write a report. 
It is a very promising direction of linguistic 
research and developlnent that can be applied in a 
wide range of activities, including language 
learning and acquisition, authoring, and text 
planning. Besides that, lexical functions are used 
for ensuring adequate lexical choice in machine 
translation and in the UNL module. 
2.1.4. Syntactic Error Correction Tool 
The module operates with Russian texts in 
which it finds a wide range of errors in 
grammatical agreement as well as case 
subcategorization a d offers the user the correct 
version. 
2.1.5. Computer-Aided Language Learning Tool 
The module is a standalone software 
application constructed as a dialogue type 
computer galne intended for advanced students of 
Russian, English, and German as foreign 
languages who wish to enrich their vocabulary, 
especially to master the collocations of these 
natural languages and their periphrastic abilities. 
The tool relies on the apparatus of lexical 
limctions. It can also be used native speakers of the 
three languages interested in increasing their 
command of the vocabulary (such as journalists, 
school teachers, or politicians). 
2.1.6. Tree Bank Workbench 
This is the module that utilizes the ETAP-3 
dictionaries, its morphological analyzer and the 
parser to produce a first-ever syntactically tagged 
corpus of Russian texts. It is a mixed type 
application that combines automatic parsing with 
human post-editing of tree structure. 
2.2. Major Features 
The following ate the most important features of 
the whole ETAP-3 environment and its modules: 
* Rule-Based Approach 
? Stratificational Approach 
? Transfer Approach 
? Syntactic Dependencies 
? Lexicalistic Approach 
? Multiple Translation 
? Maximum Reusabilty of Linguistic Resources 
84 
Ill tile current version of ETAP-3, its 
modules that process NL senteuces are strictly 
rule-based. However, ill a series of recent 
experiments, tile MT module was supplenlenled 
by all example-based component of a translation 
menlory type and a statistical component hat 
provides semiautonmtic extraction of translatiou 
equivalents t?om bilingual text corpora (see 
lomdin & Streiter 1999). 
ETAP-3 shares its stratificational feature 
with many other NLP systems. It is at tile level 
of tile normalized, or deep syntactic, structure 
that tile transfer flom tile source to tile target 
language takes place in MT. 
ETAP-3 makes use of syntactic dependency 
trees for sentence structure representation 
instead of constituent, or phrase, structure. 
Tile ETAP-3 system takes a lexicalistic 
stand ill tile sense that lexical data are 
considmed as important as gl'ammar 
infornlation. A dictionary entry contains, in 
addition to tile lemma name, information on 
syntactic and semantic features of tile word, its 
subcategorization flame, a default translation, 
and rules of various types, and wdues of lexical 
functions for which tile lemma is tile keyword. 
The word's syntactic t'eatures characterize its 
ability/nou-ability to participate ill specific 
syntactic onstructions. A word can have several 
syntactic features elected from a total of more 
than 200 items. Semantic features arc needed to 
check tile semantic agreement between the 
words ill a sentence. Tile subeategorization 
frame shows the surface marking of tile word's 
arguments (in terms of case, prepositions, 
conjtmctions, etc.). Rules are an essential part of 
the dictionary entry. All the rules operating in 
ETAP-3 are distributed betwecn tile granmmr 
and tile dictionary. Grammar rules me more 
general and apply lo large classes of words, 
whereas tile rules listed or simply referred to in 
the dictionary are restricted ill their scope and 
only apply to small classes of words or even 
individual words. This organization of tile rules 
ensures the self-tuning of tile system to tile 
processing of each particular senteuce. In 
processing a sentence, only those dictionary 
rules are actiwlted that are explicitly referred to 
ill the dictionary entries of tile words making up 
tile sentence. A sample dictionary enlry 
fl'agment for tile English noun chance illustrates 
what was said above: 
\[1\] CHANCE1

environment. 
To give a general idea of how the ETAP-3 NLP 
operates, we show here the layout of the MT 
module (Fig. I). In a way, all the other modules 
can be viewed as this module's deriwttives.

2.4. hnplementation 
The ETAP-3 environment has been implemented 
on a PC under Windows NT 4.0 environment. 
The environment has a number of auxiliary 
tools, including a sophisticated lexicographer's 
toolkit that allows the developers and the users 
to effectively maintain and update the ETAP-3 
dictionaries. 
3. The UNL Interface 
3.1 Aims and scenario 
The UNL project has a very ambitious goal: 
to break down or at least to drastically lower the 
language barrier for the Internet users. With time 
and space limitations already overcome, the 
Internet community is still separated by 
language boundaries. Theoretically, this seems 
to be the only major obstacle standing in the way 
of international and interpersonal 
communication i  the information society. This 
is why the problem of the language barrier on 
the Interact is perceived as one of the global 
problems of mankind, and a project aiming to 
solve this problem has been initiated under the 
UN auspices - by the Institute of Advanced 
Studies of the United Nations University. 
Started in 1996, the project curremly 
embraces 15 universities and research 
institutions fiom Brazil, China, Egypt, France, 
Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, 
Latvia, Mongolia, Russia, Spain, and Thailand. 
In the following years more groups are expected 
to join, so that in the long run all languages of 
the UN member states will be covered. 
The idea of the project is as follows. An 
interlingua has been developed which has 
sufficient expressive power to represent 
relevant information conveyed by natural 
languages. This interlingua entitled Universal 
Networking Language (UNL) has been 
proposed by H. Uchida (UNU/IAS). For each 
natural language, two systems should be 
developed: a "deconverter" capable of 
translating texts from UNL to this NL, and an 
"enconverter" which has to convert NL texts 
86 
into UNL. it sholtld be emphasized that the 
procedure of producing a UNL text ix not 
supposed to be fully autolnatic. It will be an 
interactive process with the labor divided 
between the COlnputer and a human expert 
("writer") in UNI+. 
This paradigm makes UNL radically 
different from conventional machine lranslation. 
Duo to the interactive oncoilversion, the UNL 
expression, which serves as inpul for generation, 
can be nlado as good as Clio wishes. The UNL 
writer will edit the rough result proposed by the 
OllConvorlor, corfect its errors, eliminate the 
renlaining ambiguities. He/she can run a 
deconvorior of his own language to lest the 
wtlidity of the UNL expression obtained alld 
then refine it again tin one is fully satisfied with 
the l'inal result.

well as to produce UNI, represelltatiOllS of the

inultiethnic public. 
3.2 UNL language 
We cannot describe the UNL language here 
in all details: this topic deserves a special paper 
which will hopefully be written by the author of 
the language design - l)r. Hiroshi Uchida. We 
will only characterize it to the extent necessary 
for the description of our deconversion module. 
Full specification of UNL can be found at 
/lllp://WWW. tml. tax. ttnu. edu/. 
UNL is a comlmter language intended to 
represent infolmation in a way that allows to 
generate a text expressing this information in a 
very large number of nahtral anguages. A UNL 
expression is an oriented hyper-graph that 
corresponds to a NL sentence in the amount of 
information conveyed. The arcs of t11o graph are 
interpreted as senmntic relations of the type 
agent, ob.ject, lime, place, inslrttment, manlier, 
etc. The nodes of the graph are special units, the 
so-called Universal Words (UW) interpreted as 
concepts, or groups of UWs. The nodes can be 
supplied with attributes which provide 
additional information on their use in lhc given 
sentence, e.g. @imperative, @generic, @future, 
@obligation. 
Each UW is represented as an t~,nglish 
word that can be optionally supplied with 
semantic specifications to restrict its meaning. 
In most cases, these specifications locate the 
concept in the knowledge base. It is done in the 
following way: UW A(icl>B) ix interpreted as 
'A is subsumed under the category B'. For 
example, the UW coach used without any 
restrictions denotes anything the English coach 
can denote, ll' eric wants to be more precise, one 
can use restrictions: coach(icl>transl)ort ) 
denotes a bus, coaclz (icl>lmman) denotes a 
trainer and coach (icl>do) denotes the action of 
training, in a sense, the apparatus of restrictions 
allows to represent UWs as disambiguated 
l';nglish words. On ltle other hand, restrictions 
allow to denote concepts which are absent in 
I~;nglish. For cxmnple, in Russian there is a large 
group of motion words, whose meaning 
incorporates the idea of the mode of locomotion 
or tral/sportation: priletel' 'come by flying', 
prO@,/' 'come by ship', l)ril)olzti 'come by 
crawling', l)ril)eJlal ' 'come running', elc. 
l!nglish has no neutral words to denote these 
concepts. Still, on the basis of English one can 
constrttct lJWs that approximate required 
concepts, e.g. conw(met>shil) ) is interpreted as 
'come and the method o1' coming ix a ship'. 
IIere is an example of a UNL expression 
for the sentence 
(2) Howevel, hmgua,q,e dll/ferences are a barrier 
to the smoot/L/low of in.fomnation in our society. 
l';ach line is an expression of the kind 
rehttion(UWl, UW2). For simplicity, UWs are 
not supplied with restrictions.

possessor. Attributes: @entry - denotes the top 
node of the structure, @present - present ense, 
@def - definite NP, @pl - plural, @however - a 
modal meaning corresponding to English 
however. 
3.3. UNL  - Russ ian  deeonvers ion  by  
means  o f  ETAP-3  
As was shown in Section 1, ETAP-3 is a 
transfer-based system where the transfer is 
carried out at the level of the Normalized 
Syntactic Structure (NormSS). This level is best 
suited for establishing correspondence with 
UNL, as UNL expressions and NormSS show 
striking similarities. The most important of theln 
are as follows: 
1. Both UNL expressions and NormSSs 
occupy an intermediate position between the 
surface and the semantic levels of 
representation. They roughly correspond to 
the so-called deep-syntactic level. At this 
level the meaning of the lexical items is not 
decomposed into the primitives, and the 
relations between the lexical items are 
language independent; 
2. The nodes of both UNL expressions and 
NormSSs are terminal elements (lexical 
items) and not syntactic ategories; 
3. The nodes carry additional characteristics 
(attributes); 
4. The arcs of both structures are non- 
symmetrical dependencies. 
At the same time, UNL expressions and 
NormSSs differ in several important respects: 
1. All the nodes of NormSSs are lexical items, 
while a node of a UNL expression can be a sub- 
graph; 
2. Nodes of a NormSS always correspond to one 
word sense, while UWs may either be broader or 
narrower than the corresponding English words: 
2.1. they can cover a meaning area that 
corresponds to several different word senses at a 
time (see above); 
2.2. they can correspond to a fi'ee word 
combination (e.g. computer-based or high- 
quality); 
2.3. they can correspond to a word form 
(e.g. best which a form of good or well); 
2.4. they can denote a concept that has no 
direct correspondence in English (see above). 
3. A NormSS is the simplest of all connected 
graphs - a tree, while a UNL expression is a 
hyper-graph. Its arcs may form a loop and 
connect sub-graphs; 
4. The relations between the nodes in a NormSS 
are purely syntactic and are not supposed to 
convey a meaning of their own, while the UNL 
relations denote semantic roles; 
5. Attributes of a NormSS mostly correspond to 
grammatical elements, while UNL attributes 
often convey a meaning that is expressed both 
in English and in Russian by means of lexical 
items (e.g. modals); 
6. A NormSS contains information on the word 
order, while a UNL expression does not say 
anything to this effect. 
The NormSS of tile sentence (2) looks as 
follows: 
be ,  present 
I~' prcdic "",ik

Fig. 2 modif~ 
our  
As UNL makes use of English lexical labels, it 
is expedient to bridge the gap between UNL and 
Russian via English NormSS which actually 
serves as an Intermediate Representation (IR). 
in this case tile UNL - Russian interface will be 
the simplest. After the English NormSS has 
been reached, conventional ETAP English-to- 
Russian machine translation mode of operation 
can be used. 
The UNL-to-Russian module carries out the 
following three steps: 
1. Transfer from UNL to the intermediate 
representation (IR). 
88 
2. Transfer fronl tile IR to tile Russian 
ilOllnalized syntactic structure (NorlriSS-1)@ 
3. (\]eneration of a P, ussian sentence from the 
NornlSS-R.  
Tile archilecture of tile UNL-Russian 
deconverter is shown in Fig. 3. 
It follows fi'om tile previous discussion that the 
UNL - NormSS interface should solve the 
following five tasks: 
1. An appropriate English lexeme for every 
UW should be selected where it is possible; 
a Russian lexeme will be provided by tile 
ETAP English - Russian transfer dictionary. 
If no appropriate English word can be found 
for a UW, other means of expression should 
be found. 
2. UNL syntactic relations should be 
tl-anslated, either by means of I~q'AP 
relations or widl tile help of lexical items. 
3. UNL attributes hould be translated, either 
by lneaus of granunatical features or with 
the help of lexical items (e.g. @however -
however). 
4. UNL graph should be converted in a tree. 
5. Word order should be established. 
The first aild (parlly) the second tasks are 
soh, ed by uleaus Of the infornlatiou stored in the 
UW English and English conlbinalorial 
dictionaries. All lhe rest (tasks 2 io 5) is done by 
the rules written in the logical-based I~'OP, tZT 
formalism. 
Let us give one example lo ilhlstrate the 
transformation f UNL relations into NL words. 
UNL has a tim relation that holds between an 
event and its linle. As is known, lhe choice of 
approl)riaie words to express lhis relation is to a 
largo oxleni doterilliried by lexical properties of 
tile word denoting tilne; cf. oz._It Moll(lay, at 
midnight, idAl summe#; rhtri, e~ the it,at; etc. In 
ETAP-3 all these cases are treated as tile lexical 
function LOC denoting (tenlporal) locality (on 
lexical functions see 2.1.3). Tile values of all 
lexical fimctions are given in the lexicon in the 
entries of their arguments ( ee an example in 2.2 
above). While processing tile UNL expression, 
the tim relation is linked to the lexical ftluclioll 
LOC which allows to l'iud a correct preposition, 
both in English and in Russian. 
3.4. Current state and prospects for the 
future

operational and can be tested at

As sllo,vn ill Fig. 3, the interface botweou 
UNL and Russian is established at tile level of 
the English NorlllS. At this point ETAP 
English-to-Russian nlachine Iranslation facility 
can be switched which carries through tile 
phases of transfer and Russian generation. This 
architecture allows to obtain English generalion 
for relatively cheap, as ETAP has a Russiau-to- 
English mode of operation as well. First 
experiments in this direction have been carried 
Otll which proved quite promising.

Abstract 
'File paper describes a tagging scheme designed 
for the Russian Treebank, and presents tools used 
for corpus creation. 
1. ln t rodudory  Remarks 
The present paper describes a project aimed at 
developing the first annotated corpus of P, ussian 
texts. I.arge text coq~ora trove been used in the 
computational linguistics community long 
enough: at present, over 20 large corpora for the 
main European languages arc available, the 
largest of them containing hundreds of millions of 
words (I.anguage Resources (19971); Marcus, 
Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993); Kurohashi, 
Nagao (1998)). So far, however, no annotated 
corpora for Russian have been developed. To the 
best of our knowledge, the present project is the 
first attempt to fill the gap. 
l)ifferent tasks require different annotation levels 
that entail different amount of additional 
information about text structure. The corpus that 
is; being created in the fiamework of the pre.sent 
project consists of several subcorpora that differ 
by the level of annotation. The following three 
levels are envisaged: 
? lemmalized leA'Is, for every word, its normal 
form (lemma) and part of speech are 
indicated; 
? mowhologically tagged leXlS: for every word, 
a full set of nlorl)hological attributes it 
specified along with the lenmm and the part of 
speech; 
? symactically tagged ldxlx: apart from tile full 
morphological markup at the word level, 
every sentence has a syntax structure. 
We annotate Russian texts with depmlde,wy 
structttres - a formalism that is more suitable for 
Slavonic languages with their relatively fiee word 
order. The structure not only contains inl'omlation 
on which words of the sentence are syntactically 
linked, but also relegates each link to one of the 
several dozen syntactic types (at present, we use 
78 syntactic relations). This formalism ensures a 
more complete and informative representation 
than ally other syntactically annotated corpus. 
This is a major innowttion, since the majority of 
syntactically annotated corpora, both those 
already awfilable and under construction, 
represent he syntactic structure by means of 
constituents. 
The closest analogue to our work is the Czech 
annotated corpus collected at Charles University 
in Prague - see I tajicova, Panevova, Sgall (19981). 
In this corpus, the syntactic data are also 
expressed in a dependency formalism, although 
the set of syntactic functional relations is much 
smaller as it only has 23 relations 
In what follows, we describe the types of texts 
used to create the coqms (Section 2), markup 
format (Section 3), annotation tools and 
procedures (Sectional), and types of linguistic 
data included in the markup (Section 5). 
2. Source text selection 
The well-known Uppsala University Corpus of 
contemporary Russian prose, totalling ca. 
1,000,000 words, has been chosen as the prilnary 
source for our work. The Uppsaht Corpus is well 
balanced between fiction and journalistic genre, 
with a smaller percentage of scientific and popular 
science texts. The Corpus includes samples of 
contemporary Russian prose, as well as excerpts 
flom newspapers and magazines of recent 
decades, and gives a representative coverage of 
987 
written Russian in modern use. Conversational 
examples are scarce and appear as dialogues 
inside fiction texts. 
3. Markup flDrnmt 
The design principles were fommlated as follows: 
? "layered" markup-  several annotation levels 
coexist and can be extracted or processed 
independently; 
? incrementality - it should be easy to add 
higher annotation levels; 
? convenient parsing of the annotated text by 
means of standard software packages. 
The most natural solution to meet this criteria is 
an XML-based markup language. We have tried 
to make our format compatible with TEI (Text 
Encoding for Interchange, see TEI Guidelines 
(1994)), inuoducing new elements or attributes 
only in situations where TEI markup does not 
provide adequate means to describe the text 
structure in the dependency grammar framework. 
Listed below are types of iuformation about text 
structure tlmt must be encoded in the markup, and 
relative tags/attributes u ed to bear them. 
a) Splitting of text into sentences. A special 
container element <S> (available in TEI) is used 
to delimit sentence boundaries. The element may 
have an (optional) ID attribute that supplies a 
unique identifier for the sentence within the text; 
this identifier may be used to store infommtion 
about extra-sentential relations in the text. It may 
also have a COMMENT attribute, used by linguists 
to store observations about particular syntactic 
phenomena encountered in the sentence; 
b) Splitting of sentences into lexical items 
~ .  The words are delimited by a container 
element <W>. Like sentences, words may have a 
unique "rD attribute that is used to reference the 
word within the sentence; 
c) Ascribing morphological features to words. 
Morphological information is ascribed to the word 
by means of two attributes born by the <W> tag: 
LlgNNg_- a normalized word form; 
FEAT - morphological features. 
d) Storing information about the syntax structure. 
To annotate the information about syntactic 
dependencies, we use two other attributes in the 
<W> element: 
DON- the ID of the master word; 
LINK - syntactic function label. 
There are also special provisions in the lbrmalism 
to store auxiliary information, e.g. multiple 
morphological nalyses and syntax trees. They are 
expected to disappear from the final version of the 
corpus. 
4. Annotat ion tools and procedures 
The procedure of corpus data acquisition is senti- 
automatic. An initial version of markup is 
generated by a computer using a general ~urpose 
morphological analyzer and syntax parser engine; 
after that, the results of the automatic processing 
are submitted to human post-editing. The analysis 
engine (morphology and parsing) is based upon 
the ETAP-3 machine translation engine - see 
Apresjan et al (1992, 1993). 
To support he creation of mmotated ata, a set of 
tools was designed and implemented. All tools are 
Win32 applications written in C++. The tools 
available are: 
? a program for sentence boundaries markup, 
called Chopper; 
" a post-editor for building, editing and mana- 
ging syntactically annotated texts - Slruclure 
Edilor (or SirEd). 
The amount of manual work required to build 
annotations depends on the complexity of the 
input data. SirEd offers different options for 
building structures. Most sentences can be reliably 
processed without any human intervention; in this 
case, a linguist should look through the processing 
result and confirm it. If the structure contains 
errors, the linguist can edit it using a user-friendly 
graphical interface (see screenshots below). If the 
errors are too many or no structure could be 
produced, the linguist may use a special split-and- 
rtm mode. This mode includes manual pre- 
chunking of the input phrase into pieces with a 
more transparent structure and applying the 
analyzer/parser to every chunk. Then the linguist 
must manually link the subtrees produced for 
every chunk into a single structure. 
If the linguist has encountered a very peculiar 
syntactic onstruction so that he/she is uncertain

5. Types of linguistic information by level 
M o rpK0Jg_g y information 
The morphological analyzer ascribes features to 
every word. The feature set for Russian includes: 
part of speech, animateness, gender, number, 
case, degree of comparison, short form (of 
adjectives and participles), representation (of 
verbs), aspect, tense, person, voice. 
Syntax information 
As we have already mentioned, the result of the 
parsing is a tree composed of links. Links are 
binary and oriented; they link single words rather 
than syntactic groups. For every syntactic group, 
one word (head) is chosen to represent it as a 
slave in larger syntactic units; all other members 
of the group become slaves of the head. 
In a typical case, the number of nodes in the 
syntactic tree corresponds to the number of word 
tokens. However, several exceptional situations 
occur in which the number of nodes may be less 
or even greater than the number of word tokens. 
The latter case is especially interesting. We 
postulate such a description in the following 
cases: 
a) Copulative sentences in the present tense 
where the auxiliary verb can be omitted. This 
is treated as a special "zero-form" of the 
copula, e.g. On - uchitel' \[He is a teacher, lit. 
He - teacher\]? The copula should be 
introduced in the syntactic representation. 
b) Elliptical constructs (omitted members of 
contrasted coordinative xpressions), like in 
Ja kupil rubashku, a on galstuk \[I bought a 
shirt, and he bought a necktie, lit. I bought a 
shirt, and he a necktie\]. 
The latter type of sentences should be discussed in 
more detail. Elliptical constructions are known to 
be one of the toughest problems in the 
formalization of natural language syntax. In our 
corpus, we decided to reconstruct he omitted 
elements in the syntactic trees, tamking them with 
a special '?phantom" feature. In the above 
example, a phantom node is inserted into the 
sentence between the words on 'he' and galstuk 
'necktie'. This new node will have a lemma 
POKUPAT" \[BUY\] and will beat" exactly the same 
morphological features as the wordform kupil 
\[bought\] physically present in the sentence, plus a 
special "phantom" marker. In certain cases, the 
feature set for the phantom may differ from that of 
the prototype, e.g. in a slightly modified phrase Ja 
kupil rubashku, aona  galstuk \[I bought a shirt, 
and she (bought) a necktie\] the phantom node will 
have the feminine gender, as required by the 
agreement with the subject of the second clause. 
Most real-life elliptical constructs can be 
represented in this way. 
The inventory of syntactic relationship types 
generated by the ETAP--3 system is wLst enough: 
at present, we count 78 different syntactic 
function types. All relationships are divided into 6 
990 
major groups: aclant, altribulive, quantitative, 
adverbial, coordinative, auxiliary. 
For readers' COlwenience, we will give equivalent 
English examples: 
Aelant relalionships link the predicate word to 
its arguments. Some examples (\[IX\] - master, 
\[Y\] - slave): 
predicative - Pete \[Y\] reads \[X\]; 
completive (1,2, 3 ) -  translate \[X\] 
the book \[Y, l-compl\] 
from \[Y1, 2-compl\] English 
into \[Y2, 3-compl\] Russian 
Ah-ibutive relationships often link a noun to a 
modifier expressed by an adjectve, another noun, 
a participle clause, etc: 
relative- The house \[X\] we live\[YI in. 
Quanlitalive relationships link a noun to a word 
with quantity semantics, or two such words one to 
another: 
quantitative - f ive \[Y\] pages \[IX\]; 
auxiliary-quantitative - gtirly \[Y\] five IX\]; 
Adverbial relationshil)s link the predicate word to 
various adverbial modifiers: 
adverbial- come \[Xl i ,  the evening \[Y\]; 
parenthetic - In my opinion IYI, lhal's \[IX\] righI. 
Coordinalive relationships serve for clauses 
coordinated by conjunctions: 
coordinative - buy apples \[XI and peaJwlYl ; 
coordinative-conj unctive - I)tty apples 
and \[X\] l)emw \[Y\]. 
Auxiliary relationships typically link two 
elements that form a single syntactic unit: 
analytical- will \[IX\] buy \[Y\]; 
The list of syntactic relations is not closed. Tile 
process of data acquisition brings up a variety of 
rare syntactic constructions, hardly covered by 
traditional grammars. In some cases, this has led 
to the introduction of new syntactic link types in 
order to reflect the semantic relation between 
single words and make tile syntactic structure 
unambiguous. 
Conclus ion 
Corpus crcation is not yet complctcd: at prcscnt, 
the flfll syntactic markup has been generated for 
4,000 sentences (55,000 words), which constitutes 
30% of the total amount planned. Our approach 
permits to include all information expressed by 
morphological and syntactic means in 
contemporary Russian. We expect that the new 
corpus will stimulate a broad range of further 
investigations, both theoretical and applied. 
We plan to make the corpus awtilable via EI,RA 
fiamework after completion. Samples of tagged 
text, documentation and structure editing tools 
will be available for download from our site:
