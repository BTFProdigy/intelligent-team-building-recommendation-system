Abstract
The QALC question-answering system,
developed at LIMSI, has been a
participant for two years in the QA
track of the TREC conference. In this
paper, we present a quantitative
evaluation of various modules in our
system, based on two criteria: first, the
numbers of documents containing the
correct answer and selected by the
system; secondly, the number of
answers found. The first criterion is
used for evaluating locally the modules
in the system, which contribute in
selecting documents that are likely to
contain the answer. The second one
provides a global evaluation of the
system. As such, it also serves for an
indirect evaluation of various modules.
1 Introduction
For two years, the TREC Evaluation
Conference, (Text REtrieval Conference) has
been featuring a Question Answering track, in
addition to those already existing. This track
involves searching for answers to a list of
questions, within a collection of documents
provided by NIST, the conference organizer.
Questions are factual or encyclopaedic, while
documents are newspaper articles. The TREC9-
QA track, for instance, proposed 700 questions
whose answers should be retrieved in a corpus
of about one million documents.
In addition to the evaluation, by human
judges, of their systems? results (Voorhees and
Tice, 2000), TREC participants are also
provided with an automated evaluation tool,
along with a database. These data consist of a
list of judgements of all results sent in by all
participants. The evaluation tool automatically
delivers a score to a set of answers given by a
system to a set of questions. This score is
derived from the mean reciprocal rank of the
first five answers. For each question, the first
correct answers get a mark in reverse proportion
to their rank. Those evaluation tool and data are
quite useful, since it gives us a way of
appreciating what happens when modifying our
system to improve it.
We have been taking part to TREC for two
years, with the QALC question-answering
system (Ferret et al 2000), currently developed
at LIMSI. This system has following
architecture: parsing of the question to find the
expected type of the answer, selection of a
subset of documents among the approximately
one million TREC-provided items, tagging of
named entities within the documents, and,
finally, search for possible answers. Some of the
components serve to enrich both questions and
documents, by adding system-readable data into
them. Such is the case for the modules that parse
questions and tag documents. Other components
operate a selection among documents, using
added data. One example of such modules are
those which select relevant documents, another
is the one which extracts the answer from the
documents.
A global evaluation of the system is based on
judgement about its answers. This criterion
provides only indirect evaluation of each
component, via the evolution of the final score
when this component is modified. To get a
closer evaluation of our modules, we need other
criteria. In particular, concerning the evaluation
of components for document selection, we
adopted an additional criterion about selected
relevant documents, that is, those that yield the
correct answer.
This paper describes a quantitative
evaluation of various modules in our system,
based on two criteria: first, the number of
selected relevant documents, and secondly, the
number of found answers. The first criterion is
used for evaluating locally the modules in the
system, which contribute in selecting documents
that are likely to contain the answer. The second
one provides a global evaluation of the system.
It also serves for an indirect evaluation of
various modules.

2.1 Question analysis
Question analysis is performed in order to assign
features to questions and use these features for
the matching measurement between a question
and potential answer sentences. It relies on a
shallow parser which spots discriminating
patterns and assigns categories to a question.
The categories correspond to the types of named
entities that are likely to constitute the answer to
this question. Named entities receive one of the
following types: person, organisation, location
(city or place), number (a time expression or a
number expression). For example the pattern
how far yields to the answer type length:
Question: How far away is the moon?
Answer type: LENGTH
Answer  within the document :
With a <b_numex_TYPE="NUMBER"> 28
<e_numex> -power telescope you can see it on
the  moon <b_numex_TYPE="LENGTH">
250,000 miles <e_numex> away.
2.2 Selection of relevant documents
The second module is a classic search
engine, giving, for each question, a ranked list of
documents, each of which could contain the
answer.
This set of documents is then processed by a
third module, made of FASTR (Jacquemin,
1999), a shallow transformational natural
language analyser and of a ranker. This module
can select, among documents found by the
search engine, a subset that satisfies more
refined criteria. FASTR improves things
because it indexes documents with a set of
terms, including not only the (simple or
compound) words of the initial question, but
also their morphological, syntactic and semantic
variants. Each index is given a weight all the
higher as it is close to the original word in the
question, or as it is significant. For instance,
original terms are considered more reliable than
semantic variants, and proper names are
considered more significant than nouns. Then,
documents are ordered according to the number
and the quality of the terms they contain. An
analysis of the weight graph of the indexed
documents enables the system to select a
relevant subpart of those documents, whose size
varies along the questions. Thus, when the curve
presents a high negative slope, the system only
select documents before the fall, otherwise a
fixed threshold is used.
2.3 Named entity recognition
The fourth module tags named entities in
documents selected by the third one. Named
entities are recognized through a combination of
lexico-syntactic patterns and significantly large
lexical data. The three lists used for lexical
lookup are CELEX (1998), a lexicon of 160,595
inflected words with associated lemma and
syntactic category, a list of 8,070 first names
(6,763 of which are from the CLR (1998)
archive) and a list of 211,587 family names also
from the CLR archive.
2.4 Question-sentence pairing
The fifth module evaluates each sentence in
the ranker-selected documents, using a
similarity measure between, on one side, terms
and named entities in the sentence, and on the
other side, words in the questions and expected
answer type. To do so, it uses the results of the
question parser, and the named entity tagger,
along with a frequency-weighted vocabulary of
the TREC corpus.
The QALC system proposes long and short
answers. Concerning the short ones, the system
focuses on parts of sentences that contain the
expected named entity tags, when they are
available, or on the larger subpart without any
terms.
3 Search engine evaluation
The second module of the QALC system deals
with the selection, through a search engine, of
documents that may contain an answer to a
given question from the whole TREC corpus
(whose size is about 3 gigabytes).
We tested three search engines with the 200
questions that were proposed at the TREC8 QA
track. The first one is Zprise, a vectorial search
engine developed by NIST. The second is
Indexal (de Loupy et al1998), a pseudo-boolean
search engine developed by Bertin
Technologies1. The third search engine is ATT
whose results to the TREC questions are
provided by NIST in the form of ranked lists of
the top 1000 documents retrieved for each
question. We based our search engine tests on

with the outputs of Indexal on the TREC collection for the
TREC8-QA and TREC9-QA question set.
the list of relevant documents extracted from the
list of correct answers provided by TREC
organizers.
Since a search engine produces a large
ranked list of relevant documents, we had to
define the number of documents to retain for
further processing. Indeed, having too many
documents leads to a question processing time
that is too long, but conversely, having too few
documents reduces the possibility of obtaining
the correct answer. The other goal of the tests
obviously was to determine the best search
engine, that is to say the one that gives the
highest number of relevant documents.
3.1 Document selection threshold
In order to determine the best selection
threshold, we carried out four different tests
with the Zprise search engine. We ran Zprise for
the 200 questions and then compared the
number of relevant documents respectively in
the top 50, 100, 200, and 500 retrieved
documents. Table 1 shows the test results.
Selection
Threshold
Questions with

documents
Questions with
no relevant
documents
50 181 19
100 184 16
200 193 7
500 194 6
Table 1. Number of questions with and
without relevant documents retrieved for
different thresholds
According to Table 1, the improvement of
the search engine results tends to decrease
beyond the threshold of 200 documents. The top
200 ranked documents thus seem to offer the
best trade-off between the number of documents
in which the answer may be found and the
question processing time.
3.2 Evaluation
We compared the results given by the three
search engines for a threshold of 200
documents. Table 2 gives the tests results.

Table 2. Compared performances of the
Indexal, Zprise and ATT search engines
All three search engines perform quite well.
Nevertheless, the ATT search engine revealed
itself the most efficient according to the
following two criteria: the lowest number of
questions for which no relevant document was
retrieved, and the most relevant documents
retrieved for all the 200 questions. Both criteria
are important. First, it is most essential to obtain
relevant documents for as many questions as
possible. But the number of relevant documents
for each question also counts, since having more
sentences containing the answer implies a
greater probability to actually find it.
4 Document ranking evaluation
As the processing of 200 documents by the
following Natural Language Processing (NLP)
modules still was too time-consuming, we
needed an additional stronger selection. The
selection of relevant documents performed by
the re-indexing and selection module relies on
an NLP-based indexing composed of both
single-word and phrase indices, and linguistic
links between the occurrences and the original
terms. The original terms are extracted from the
questions. The tool used for extracting text
sequences that correspond to occurrences or
variants of these terms is FASTR (Jacquemin,
1999). The ranking of the documents relies on a
weighted combination of the terms and variants
extracted from the documents. The use of multi-
words and variants for document weighting
makes a finer ranking possible.
The principle of the selection is the
following: when there is a sharp drop of the
documents weight curve after a given rank, we
keep only those documents which occur before
the drop. Otherwise, we arbitrarily keep the first
100.
In order to evaluate the efficiency of the
ranking process, we proceeded to several
measures. First, we apply our system on the
material given for the TREC8 evaluation, one
time with the ranking process, and another time
without this process. 200 documents were
retained for each of the 200 questions. The
system was scored by 0.463 in the first case, and
by 0.452 in the second case. These results show
that document selection slightly improves the
final score while much reducing the amount of
text to process.
However, a second measurement gave us
more details about how things are improved.
Indeed, when we compare the list of relevant
documents selected by the search engine with
the list of ranker-selected ones, we find that the
ranker loses relevant documents. For thirteen
questions among the 200 in the test, the ranker
did not consider relevant documents selected by
the search engine. What happens is: the global
score improves, because found answers rank
higher, but the number of found answers
remains the same.
The interest to perform such a selection is
also illustrated by the results given Table 3,
computed on the TREC9 results.

Table 3. Evaluation of the ranking process
We see that the selection process discards
documents for 50% of the questions: 340
questions are processed from less than 100
documents. For those 340 questions, the average
number of selected documents is 37. The
document set retrieved for those questions has a
weight curve with a sharp drop. QALC finds
more often the correct answer and in a better
position for these 340 questions than for the 342
remaining ones. These results are very
interesting when applying such time-consuming
processes as named-entities recognition and
question/sentence matching. Document selection
will also enable us to apply further sentence
syntactic analysis.
5 Question-sentence pairing evaluation
We sent to TREC9 two runs which gave
answers of 250 characters length, and one run
which gave answers of 50 characters length. The
first and the last runs used ATT as search
engine, and the second one, Indexal. Results are
consistent with our previous analysis (see
Section 3.2). Indeed, the run with ATT search
engine gives slightly better results (0.407 strict)2
than those obtained with the Indexal search
engine (0.375 strict).  Table 4 sums up the
number of answers found by our two runs.

The score of the run with answers of 50

amounting only 0.178, with 183 correct answers
retrieved3.
5.1 Long answers
From results of the evaluation concerning
document ranking, we see that the performance
level of the question-sentence matcher depends
partly on the set of sentences it has parsed, and
not only on the presence, or absence, of the
answer within these sentences. In other words,
we do not find the answer each time it is in the
set of selected sentences, but we find it easily if
there are few documents (and then few
sentences) selected. That is because similarity
                                                           
2 With this score, the QALC system was ranked 6th among
25 participants at TREC9 QA task for answers with 250
characters length.

among 24 participants at TREC9 QA task for answers with
50 characters length.
assessment relies upon a small number of
criteria, which are found to be insufficiently
discriminant. Therefore, several sentences
obtain the same mark, in which case, the rank of
the correct answer depends on the order in
which sentences are encountered.
This is something we cannot yet manage, so
we evaluated the matcher?s performance,
without any regard to the side effect induced by
document processing order. As remarked in 3.2,
search engines perform well. In particular, ATT
retains relevant documents, namely, those that
yield good answers, for 97 percent of the
questions. The ranker, while improving the final
score, loses some questions. After it stepped in,
the system retains relevant documents for 90%
of the questions. The matcher finds a relevant
document in the first five answers for 74% of
the questions, but answers only 62% of them
correctly.  Finding the right document is but one
step, knowing where to look inside it is no
obvious task.
5.2 Short answers
A short answer is selectively extracted from
a long one. We submitted this short answer
selector (under 50 characters) to evaluation
looking for the impact of the expected answer
type. Among TREC questions, some expect an
answer consisting of a named entity: for instance
a date, a personal or business name. In such
cases, assigning a type to the answer is rather
simple, although it implies the need of a good
named entity recognizer. Answers to other
questions (why questions for instance, or some
sort of what questions), however, will consist of
a noun or sentence. Finding its type is more
complex, and is not done very often.
Some systems, like FALCON (Harabagiu et
al 2000) use Wordnet word class hierarchies to
assign types to answers. Among 682 answers in
TREC9, 57.5% were analysed by our system as
named-entity questions, while others received
no type assignment. Among answers from our
best 250-character run, 62.7% were about
named entities. However, our run for shorter
answers, yielding a more modest score, gives
84% of named-entities answers. In our system
answer type assignment is of surprisingly small
import, where longer answers are concerned.
However, it does modify the selecting process,
when the answer is extracted from a longer
sentence.
Such evaluations help us to see more clearly
where our next efforts should be directed.
Having more criteria in the similarity
measurement would, in particular, be a source of
improvement.
6 Discussion
We presented quantitative evaluations. But since
we feel that evaluations should contribute to
improvements of the system, more qualitative
and local ones also appear interesting.
TREC organizers send us, along with run
results, statistics about how many runs found the
correct answer, and at which rank. Such
statistics are useful in many ways. Particularly,
they provide a characterisation of a posteriori
difficult questions. Knowing that a question is a
difficult one is certainly relevant when trying to
answer it. Concerning this problem, de Loupy
and Bellot (2000) proposed an interesting set of
criteria to recognize a priori difficult questions.
They use word frequency, multi-words,
polysemy (a source of noise) and synonymy (a
source of silence). They argue that an
?intelligent? system could even insist that a
question be rephrased when it is too difficult.
While their approach is indeed quite promising,
we consider that their notion of a priori
difficulty should be complemented by the notion
of a posteriori difficulty we mentioned: the two
upcoming examples of queries show that a
question may seem harmless at first sight, even
using de Loupy and Bellot?s criteria, and still
create problems for most systems.
From these statistics, we also found
disparities between our system and others for
certain questions. At times, it finds a good
answer where most others fail and obviously the
reverse also happens. This is the case in the two
following examples. The first one concerns an
interesting issue in a QA system that is the
determination of which terms from the question
are to be selected for the question-answer
pairing. This is particularly important when the
question has few words. For instance, to the
question  How far away is the moon?, our term
extractor kept not only moon?(NN), but also
away?(RB) . Moreover, our question parser
knows that how far is an interrogative phrase
yielding a LENGTH type for the answer. This
leads our system to retrieve the correct answer:
With a 28-power telescope, you can see it on the
moon 250,000 miles away4.
The second example concerns the relative
weight of the terms within the question. When a
proper noun is present, it must be found in the
answer, hence an important weight for it. Look
at the question Who manufactures the software,
? ?PhotoShop??? . The term extractor kept
s o f t w a r e ( N N ) , PhotoShop(NP),  a n d
manufacture(VBZ) as terms to be matched, but
the matcher assigns equal weights to them, so
we could not find the answer5. Later, we
modified these weights, and the problem was
solved.
Indeed, evaluation corpus seems to be
difficult to build. Apart from the problem of the
question difficulty level, question type
distribution may also vary from a corpus to
another. For instance, we note that TREC8
proposed much more questions with named
entity answer type (about 80%) than TREC9
(about 60%). Thus, some participants who trains
their systems on the TREC8 corpus were
somehow disapointed by their results at TREC9
with regards with their training results (Scott
and Gaizauskas, 2000).
However, it is generally hard to predict what
will happen if we modify the system. A local
improvement can result in a loss of performance
for other contexts. Although the system?s
complexity cannot be reduced to just two levels
(a local one and a global one), this can be an
efficient step in the design of improvements to
the whole system via local adjustments. But this
is a very frequent situation in engineering tasks.
7 Conclusion and perspectives
Each evaluation reflects a viewpoint, underlying
the criterion we use. In our case, the choice of
criteria was guided by the existence of two main
stages in the QA process, namely the selection
of relevant documents and the selection of the
answer among the selected documents
sentences. Sometimes, such criteria concur in
                                                           
4 Among the 42 runs using 250 byte limit, submitted at
TREC9-QA, only seven found the correct answer at rank 1,
and 27 do not found it.
5 22 runs, out of 42 found the right answer at rank 1. Only
9 were unable to find it.
revealing the same positive or negative feature
of the system. They can also yield a more
precise assessment of the reasons behind these
features, as was the case in our evaluation of the
ranker. Moreover, when a system consists of
several modules, their specific evaluations
should imply different criteria.
This is particularly true in dialogue systems,
where different kinds of processes are co-
operating. Since information retrieval is an
interactive task, it seems natural to associate a
dialogue component to it. Indeed, users tend to
ask a question, evaluate the answer, and
reformulate their question to make it more
specific (or, contrariwise, more general, or quite
different). A QA system is, therefore, a good
applicative setting for a dialogue module.
Quantitative assessment of the QA system
would be useful in assessing the dialogue system
in this particular context. Such a global
assessment would provide an objective
judgement about whether the task (finding the
answer) was achieved, or not. Successfulness in
a task is a necessary component of the
evaluation, nevertheless it is just a part of it.
Obviously, dialogue evaluation is also a matter
of cost (time, number of exchanges) and of user-
friendliness (cognitive ergonomy).
However, objectivity is almost impossible to
attain in these domains. In a recent debate
(LREC 2000), serious objections about natural
language tools evaluation and validation were
developed e.g. by Sabah (2000). The main issue
he raises is about the great complexity of such
systems. However, we consider that by going as
far as possible in the experimental search for
evaluation criteria, we also make a meaningful
contribution to this debate. While it is true that
complexity should never be ignored, we
consider that, by successive approximate
modelisation and evaluation cycles, we can
capture some of it at each step of our system?s
developement.

Abstract
The relevance of human judgment in an
evaluation campaign is illustrated here
through the DEFT text mining campaigns.
In a first step, testing a topic for a cam-
paign among a limited number of human
evaluators informs us about the feasibility
of a task. This information comes from the
results obtained by the judges, as well as
from their personal impressions after pass-
ing the test.
In a second step, results from individual
judges, as well as their pairwise matching,
are used in order to adjust the task (choice
of a marking scale for DEFT?07 and selec-
tion of topical categories for DEFT?08).
Finally, the mutual comparison of com-
petitors? results, at the end of the evalu-
ation campaign, confirms the choices we
made at its starting point, and provides
means to redefine the task when we shall
launch a future campaign based on the
same topic.
1 Introduction
For the past four years, the DEFT1 (De?fi Fouille
de Texte) campaigns have been aiming to evalu-
ate methods and software developed by several re-
search teams in French text mining, on a variety of
topics.

speeches (2005), the topical segmentation of po-
litical, scientific and juridical corpora (2006), the
automatic affectation of opinion values to texts de-
veloping an argumented judgment (2007), and the
identification of the genre and topic of a docu-
ment (2008).
Human judgment was used during the prepara-
tion of the last two campaigns, to assess the dif-
ficulty of the task, and to see which parameters
could be modified. To do this, before the partic-
ipants start competing via their software, we put
human judges in front of versions of the task with
various sets of parameters. This allows us to adjust
the definition of the task according to which diffi-
culties were encountered, and how judges agree to-
gether. These human judges are in small number,
and belong to our team. However, results of the
campaign are automatically evaluated with refer-
ence to results attached to the corpus from the start.
This is because the evaluation of a campaign?s
results by human judges is expensive. For in-
stance, TREC2 international evaluation campaigns
are supported by the NIST institute and funded by
state agencies. In Europe, on the same domains,
the CLEF3 campaigns are funded by the Euro-
pean Commission, and in France, evaluation cam-
paigns are also funded by projects, such as Tech-
nolangue4. DEFT campaigns, however, are con-
ducted with small budgets. That means for us to
have selected corpora that contain the desired re-
sults. For instance, in a campaign for topical cat-
egorization, we must start with a topically tagged
corpus. By so doing, we also can, at the end of
a campaign, compare results from human judges
with results from competitors, using an identical

common reference.
In this paper, we describe experiments we per-
formed with human judgments when preparing
DEFT campaigns. We survey the various steps
in the preparation of the last two campaigns, and
we go through the detail of how human evalua-
tion, performed during these steps, led us to the
parametrization of these two campaigns. We also
present a comparative analysis of results found by
human judges and results submitted by competi-
tors in the challenge. We conclude about the rel-
evance of the human evaluation of a task, prior to
evaluating software dedicated to this task.
2 Parametrization of the campaign
We were competitors in the 2005 and 2006 edi-
tions, and became organisators for the 2007 and
2008 campaigns. For both challenges that we or-
ganized, we went through the classical steps of the
evaluation paradigm (Adda et al, 1999), to which
we systematically added a step of human test of the
task, in order to adjust those parameters that could
be modified. The steps, therefore, are following:
1. thinking about potential topics;
2. choice of a task and collection of corpora;
3. choice of measurements;
4. test of the task by human judges on an extract
of the corpus in order to precisely define its
parameters;
5. launching the task, recruiting participants;
6. testing period;
7. adjudication: possibility of complaints about
the results;
8. workshop that closes the campaign.
Whenever human judges have to evaluate the
results of participants in a campaign, the main
problems are about correctly defining the judging
criteria to be applied by judges, and that judges
be in sufficient number to vote on judging each
document. Hovy et al (2002) describe work to-
ward formalization of software evaluation method-
ology in NLP, developed in the EAGLES5 and
5http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/home.
html
ISLE6 projects. For cost-efficiency reasons, au-
tomatic evaluation is relevant, and its results have
sometimes been compared to results from human
judges. For instance, Eck and Hori (2005) com-
pare results of evaluation measurements used in
automatic translation with human judgments on
the same corpus. In (Burstein and Wolska, 2003),
the authors describe an experiment in the evalua-
tion of writing style and find a better agreement
between the automatic evaluation system and one
human judge, than between two human judges.
Returning to the DEFT campaign, once the task
is chosen, the corpora are collected, and evaluation
measurements are defined, there can remain some
necessity of adjusting parameters, according to the
expected difficulty of the task. This could be, for
instance, the level of granularity in a task of top-
ical segmentation, or which categories should be
relevant in a task of categorization. To get this ad-
justing done, we submit the task to human judges.
In 2007, the challenge was about the automatic
affectation of opinion values to texts developing an
argumented judgment (Grouin et al, 2007). We
collected opinion texts already tagged by an opin-
ion value, such as film reviews that, in addition
to a text giving the judgment of the critic on the
film, also feature a mark in the shape of a variable
number of stars. The adjustable parameter of the
task, therefore, is the scale of opinion values. The
task will be more or less difficult, according to the
range of this scale.
The 2008 campaign was about classifying a set
of documents by genre and topic (Hurault-Plantet
et al, 2008). The choice of genres and topics is
a crucial one. Some pairs of topics or genres are
more difficult to separate than other ones. We also
had to find different genres sharing a set of topical
categories, while corpora in French are not so very
abundant. So we selected two genres, encyclo-
pedia and daily newspaper, and about ten general
topical categories. The parameter we had to ad-
just was the set of categories to be matched against
each other.
3 Assessing the difficulty of a task
3.1 Calibration of an opinion value scale
In 2007, the challenge was about the automatic af-
fectation of opinion values to texts developing an
argumented judgment. In view of that, we col-
lected four corpora that covered various domains:
6http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/isle/
18
reviews of films and books, of video games and of
scientific papers, as well as parliamentary debates
about a draft law.
Each corpus had the interesting feature of com-
bining a mark or opinion with a descriptive text, as
the mark was used to sum up the judment in the
argumentative part of this text. Due to the diver-
sity of sources, we found as many marking scales
as involved copora:
? 2 values for parliamentary debates7 (the rep-
resentative who took part in the debate was
either in favour or in disfavour of the draft
law) ;
? 4 values for scientific paper reviews (accepted
as it stands ? accepted with minor changes
? accepted with major changes and second
overall reviewing ?rejected), based on a set of
criteria including interestingness, relevance
and originality of the paper?s content ;
? 5 values for film and book reviews8 (a mark
between 0 and 4, from bad to excellent) ;
? 20 values for video game reviews9 (a global
mark calculated from a set of advices about
various aspects of the game: graphics, playa-
bility, life span, sound track and scenario).
In order to, first, assess the feasibility of the task,
and to, secondly, define the scale of values to be
used in the evaluation campaign, we submitted hu-
man judges to several tests (Paek, 2001): they were
instructed to assign a mark on two kinds of scale, a
wide one with the original values, and a restricted
one with 2 or 3 values, depending on the corpus it
was applying to. The results from various judges
were evaluated in terms of precision and recall, and
matched to each other by way of the Kappa coeffi-
cient (Carletta, 1996) (Cohen, 1960).
We present hereunder the values of the ? coef-
ficient between pairs of human judges, and with
the reference, on the video game corpus. The wide
scale (Table 1) uses the original values (marks be-
tween 0 and 20), while the restricted scale (Ta-
ble 2) relies upon 3 values with following defini-
tions: class 0 for original marks between 0 and 10,
class 1 for marks between 11 and 14, and class 2
for marks between 15 and 20.

Table 2: Video game corpus: restricted scale,
marks from 0 to 2.
Table 1 and 2 show that agreement between
judges varies widely when marking scales are
modified. Table 1 shows that there is an insuffi-
cient agreement among judges on the wide scale,
with ? coefficients lower than 0.20, while the
agreement between these same judges can be con-
sidered as good on the restricted scale, with ? co-
efficients between 0.54 and 0.79 (Table 2), the me-
dian being at 0.74.
In order to confirm the validity of the change
in scales, we used the ? to test how each judge
agreed with himself, between his two sets of re-
sults (Table 3). Therefore, we compared judg-
ments made by each judge using the initial value
scale and converted towards the restricted scale,
with judgments made by the same judge directly
using the restricted value scale. This measurement
shows the degree of correspondence between both
scales for each judge. Among the three judges who
took part in the test, the first and third one agree
well with themselves, while for the second one, the
agreement is only moderate.
Judge 1 2 3
1 0.74
2 0.46
3 0.70
Table 3: Video game corpus: agreement of each
judge with himself when scales change.
We did the same for a second corpus, of film re-
views. The test involved five judges, and the scale
19
change was smaller, since it was from five values
to three, and not from twenty to three. For this
scale change, we merged the two lowest values (0
and 1) into one (0), and the two highest ones (3
and 4) into one (2), and the middle value in the
wide scale (2) remained the intermediate one in
the restricted scale (1). This scale change was the
most relevant one, since, with 29.7% of the docu-
ments, the class of the middle mark (2) accounted
for almost one third of the corpus. However, the
two other groups of documents are less well bal-
anced. Indeed, the lowest mark concerns less doc-
uments than the highest one: 4.6% and 10.3% re-
spectively for the initial marks 0 and 1, while one
finds 39.8% and 15.6% of documents for the marks
3 and 4. Grouping the documents in only two
classes, by joining the middle class with the two
lowest ones, would have yielded a better balance
between classes, with 44.6% of documents for the
lower mark and 55.4% for the higher one, but that
would have been less meaningful.
Results from human judges are shown in the Ta-
bles 4 and 5 for both scales.

Table 5: Film review corpus: restricted scale,
marks from 0 to 2.
Agreements between human judges ranked from
bad to moderate for the wide scale (the five origi-
nal values in this corpus), while these agreements
rank from insufficient to good in the case of the
restricted scale with three values. We can see that
differences induced by the scale change are much
less important than with the video game corpus.
This agrees well with the scales being much closer
to each other.
By first performing a hand-made evaluation, and
secondly, matching between themselves the results
from the judges, we found a way to assess with
greater precision the difficulty of the evaluation
task we were about to launch. Concerning the
first two review corpora (films and books, video
games), we attached values good, average and bad
to the three selected classes. The scale for sci-
entific paper reviews was also restricted to three
classes for which following values were selected:
paper accepted as it stands or with minor edits, pa-
per accepted after major edits, paper rejected. Fi-
nally, since its original scale had only two values,
the corpus of parliamentary debates underwent no
change of scale.
3.2 Choice of a topical category set
In order to determine which topical categories
should be recognized in the 2008 task of classify-
ing documents by genre and topic, we performed a
manual evaluation of a sample of the corpus with 4
human judges. The sample included 30 Le Monde
papers for the journalistic genre, and 30 Wikipedia
entries for the encyclopedic genre. Only the title
and body of each article was kept in the sample,
and the tables were deleted. All marks of inclu-
sion in either corpus were also deleted (references
to Le Monde and Wikipedia tags).
The test ran this way: each article was put in a
separate file, and the evaluators had to identify the
genre and the topical category under which it was
published. All articles were included in one set,
which means evaluators had to choose, between all
categories and genres, which ones to match with
each document. This test was made with a first
selection of 8 categories, shared by both genres,
listed in Table 6.
Table 7 shows that results from human judges
in terms of precision and recall were excellent on
the identification of genre (F-scores between 0.94
and 1.00) and quite good on the identification of
categories (F-scores between 0.66 and 0.82).
We also proceeded to the pairwise matching of
results from human judges via the ? coefficient.
Results show an excellent agreement of judges
among themselves and with the reference for genre
identification (Table 8). The agreement is mod-

erate to good for categoy identification (Table 9).
These good results led us to keep the corpora as
they stood, since they appeared to constitute a
good reference for the defined task. However, we
made an exception for category Notebook (biogra-
phies of celebrities) which we discarded for two
reasons. First, it is more of a genre, namely, ?bi-
ography?, rather than a topical category. Secondly,
we found it rather difficult to assign a single cate-
gory to articles which could belong in two different
ones, as would be the case for the biography of a
sportsman, which would fall under both categories

cluded two subtasks, one being genre and topic
recognition for a first set of categories, the other
one being only topic recognition for a second set
of categories. Therefore, the corpus had to be di-
vided in two parts. In order to find which cate-
gories had to go into which subcorpus, we decided
to estimate, for each category, the difficulty of rec-
ognizing it. To do so, we calculated the precision
and recall of each evaluator for each category. This
measurement was obtained via a second evaluation
of human judges, with a wider set of categories (by
adding categories Art and Literature).
The ordering of categories by decreasing pre-
cision is following: Sport (1.00), International
(0.80), France (0.76), Literature (0.76), Art (0.74),
Television (0.71), Economy (0.58), Science (0.33),
Society (0.26). This means no document in the
Sport category was misclassified, and, contrari-
wise, categories Science and Society were the most
problematic ones.
The ordering by decreasing recall is slightly
different: International (0.87), Economy (0.80),
Sport (0.75), France (0.70), Art (0.62), Literature
(0.49), Television (0.46), Society (0.42), Science
(0.33). Hence, articles in the International cate-
gory were best identified. This ordering also con-
firms the difficulty felt by human judges concern-
ing the categories Society and Science.
We decided to distribute the categories for each
subtask according to a balance between easy and
diffucult ones in terms of human evaluation:
? Art, Economy, Sport, Television for the sub-
task with both genre and category recogni-
tion;
? France, International, Literature, Science,
Society for the subtask with only category
recognition. For this second subset, we put
together three categories which are topically
close (France, International and Society).

4 Human judgments and software
4.1 Confirming the difficulty of a task
The 2007 edition of DEFT highlighted two main
phenomena concerning the corpora involved in the
task.
First, each corpus yielded a different level of dif-
ficulty, and this gradation of difficulty among cor-
pora appeared both for human evaluators and com-
petitors in the challenge (Paroubek et al, 2007).
Judges Competitors
Debates 0.77/1.00 0.54/0.72
Game reviews 0.73/0.90 0.46/0.78
Film reviews 0.52/0.79 0.38/0.60
Paper reviews 0.41/0.58 0.40/0.57
Table 10: Minimal and maximal strict F-scores
between human evaluators and competitors in the
challenge, 2007 edition.
During human tests, judges mentioned the great
facility of finding about opinions expressed in the
corpus of parliamentary debate. Next came cor-
pora of video game reviews, and then of film and
book reviews, whose difficulty was considered av-
erage, and last, the corpus of scientific paper re-
views, which the judges perceived as particularly
difficult. This gradation of difficulty among cor-
pora was also found among competitors, following
the same ordering of three levels of difficulty.
Secondly, the difficulties met by human eval-
uators are also found in the case of competitors.
Upon finishing human tests, judges felt difficulties
in evaluating the corpus of scientific paper reviews,
yielding poor results. Now, the results of competi-
tors on the same corpus are quite as poor, occupy-
ing exactly the same value interval as for human
judges. Most competitors, by the way, obtained
their worst results on this corpus.
The alikeness of results between judges and
competitors reflects the complexity of the corpus:
when preparing the campaign, we observed that
reviews were quite short. Therefore, assigning a
value had to rely upon a small amount of data.
From that, we can derive a minimal size for docu-
ments to be used in this kind of evaluation. More-
over, a paper review can be seen as an aid for the
author, to be expressed as positively as possible,
even if it is also addressed to the Program Commit-
tee which has to accept or reject the paper. There-
fore, the mark could prove more negative than the
text of the review.
The case of comments about videogames is a
different one. Indeed, giving a global mark on a
scale of 20 is a difficult task. Therefore, this mark
comes most often from a sum of smaller marks
which rate either the whole document according
to various criteria, or parts of this document. In
our corpus, each reviewer rates the game accord-
ing to several criteria, namely, graphics, playa-
bility, life span, sound track and scenario, from
which a rather long text is produced, making the
judgment an easier task to perform. However, the
global mark differs from the sum of the smaller
ones from various criteria, hence the difficulty for
human judges to reckon this global mark on a scale
of 20.
4.2 Confirmation of the expected success of
competitors
Contrary to the 2007 edition, in which competi-
tors obtained results that confirmed those of human
judges, the 2008 edition gave them the opportunity
to reach a higher level than human evaluators.
While genre identification yielded no special
problem, either for human evaluators or for com-
petitors, and the results obtained by both groups
are similar, competitors reached better results than
human judges in topical categorization.
Concerning genre identification, strict F-scores
are situated between 0.94 and 1.00 for human
judges, and between 0.95 and 0.98 for the best
runs of competitors (each competitor was allowed
to submit up to three collections of results, only
the best one being used for the final ranking). As
for topical categorization, strict F-scores go from
0.66 to 0.82 for human evaluators, and from 0.84
to 0.89 for best runs from competitors.
The equivalence of results on genre identifica-
tion between judges and competitors can be ex-
plained by the fact that it was a simple, binary
choice (the newspaper Le Monde vs. Wikipedia).
Contrariwise, competitors obtained better re-
sults in topical categorization, since machines have
a stronger abstraction capacity than humans in
presence of the 9 topical categories we defined
(Art, Economy, France, International, Literature,
Science, Society, Sport and Television). However,
conditions were not quite similar, since human
judges had to pick a category among eight, and
not, like the automatic systems, a category within
two subsets of four and five categories. Indeed,
22
we dispatched the categories into two sets, by bal-
ancing categories that are easy or difficult for hu-
man evaluators. For the second set of categories,
we carefully put together three semantically close
ones, (France, International and Society, all three
of them being about political and societal con-
tents), to make the task more difficult. Although
the second set of categories seems more compli-
cated for human judges, half of the competitors ob-
tained better results in topical categorization of the
second set than of the first one.
5 Conclusion
The relevance of human judgment in an evaluation
campaign is present from the beginning to the end
of a campaign.
In a first step, testing a topic for a campaign
among a limited number of human evaluators al-
lows us to check the feasibility of a task. This
checking relies both on the results obtained by
judges (recall, precision, F-scores) and on their
personal impressions after passing the test.
In a second step, the study of both the results ob-
tained by the judges, and their pairwise matching
involving such a comparator as the ? coefficient
allows us to adjust the task (choice of a marking
scale for DEFT?07 and selection of topical cate-
gories for DEFT?08).
Finally, the mutual comparison of competitors?
results, at the end of the evaluation campaign, al-
lows us to validate the choices we made at its start-
ing point, and even to reposition the task when we
shall launch a future campaign based on the same
topic.
