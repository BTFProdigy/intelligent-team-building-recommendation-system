1 Introduction
Deterministic transition-based Shift/Reduce depen-
dency parsers make often mistakes in the analysis of
long span dependencies (McDonald & Nivre, 2007).
Titov and Henderson (2007) address this accuracy
drop by using a beam search instead of a greedy al-
gorithm for predicting the next parser transition.
We propose a parsing method that allows reduc-
ing several of these errors, although maintaining a
quasi linear complexity. The method consists in two
steps: first the sentence is parsed by a determinis-
tic Shift/Reduce parser, then a second deterministic
Shift/Reduce parser analyzes the sentence in reverse
using additional features extracted from the parse
trees produced by the first parser.
Right-to-left parsing has been used as part of
ensemble-based parsers (Sagae & Lavie, 2006; Hall
et al, 2007). Nivre and McDonald (2008) instead
use hints from one parse as features in a second
parse, exploiting the complementary properties of
graph-based parsers (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al,
2005) and transition-based dependency parsers (Ya-
mada & Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre & Scholz, 2004).
Also our method uses input from a previous parser
but only uses parsers of a single type, determin-
istic transition-based Shift/Reduce, maintaining an
overall linear complexity. In fact both the en-
semble parsers and the stacking solution of Nivre-
McDonald involve the computation of the maximum
spanning tree (MST) of a graph, which require algo-
rithms of quadratic time complexity (e.g. (Chu &
Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967)).
We introduce an alternative linear combination
method. The algorithm is greedy and works by com-
bining the trees top down. We tested it on the de-
pendency trees produced by three parsers, a Left-
to-Right (LR ), a Right-to-Left (RL ) and a stacked
Right-to-Left parser, or Reverse Revision parser
(Rev2 ). 1 The experiments show that in practice
its output often outperforms the results produced by
calculating the MST.
2 Experiments
In the reported experiments we used DeSR (Attardi
at al., 2007), a freely available implementation of
a transition-based parser. The parser processes in-
put tokens advancing on the input with Shift actions
and accumulates processed tokens on a stack with
Reduce actions. The parsing algorithm is fully de-
terministic and linear.
For the LR parser and the Rev2 parser we em-
ployed an SVM classifier while aMaximum Entropy
classifier, with lower accuracy, was used to create
the training set for the Rev2 parser. The reason for
this appears to be that the output of a low accuracy
parser with many errors provides a better source of
learning to the stacked parser.
The Rev2 parser exploits the same basic set of
features as in the LR parser plus the additional fea-
tures extracted from the output of the LR parser
listed in Table 1, where: PHLEMMA is the lemma
of the predicted head, PHPOS is the Part of Speech
of the predicted head, PDEP is the predicted depen-
dency label of a token to its predicted head, PHDIST
indicates whether a token is located before or after
1The stacked Left-to-Right parser produced slightly worse
results than Rev2.

its predicted head, PHHLEMMA is the lemma of
the predicted grandparent and PHDEP is the pre-
dicted dependency label of the predicted head of a
token to the predicted grandparent. s0 refers to a to-
ken on top of the stack, wi refers to word at the i-th
relative position with respect to the current word and
parsing direction. This feature model was used for
all languages in our tests.
We present experiments and comparative error
analysis on three representative languages from the
CoNLL 2007 shared task (Nivre at al., 2007): Ital-
ian, Czech and English. We also report an evaluation
on all thirteen languages of the CoNLL-X shared
task (Buchholz &Marsi, 2006), for comparison with
the results by Nivre and McDonald (2008).
Table 2 shows the Labeled Attachment Score
(LAS), for the Left-to-right parser (LR ), Right-to-
Left (RL ), Reverse Revision parser (Rev2 ), linear
parser combination (Comb) and MST parser combi-
nation (CombMST).
Figure 1 and 2 present the accuracies of the LR
and Rev2 parsers for English relative to the depen-
dency length and the length of sentences, respec-
tively. For Czech and Italian the RL parser achieves
higher accuracy than the LR parser and the Rev2
parser even higher. The error analysis for Czech
showed that the Rev2 parser improves over the LR
parser everywhere except in the Recall for depen-
dencies of length between 10 and 14. Such an im-
provement has positive impact on the analysis of
sentences longer than 10 tokens, like for Italian.

For direct comparison with the approach by Nivre
and McDonald (2008), we present the results on the
CoNLL-X corpora (Table 3): MST and MSTMalt

2.2 Remarks
The Rev2 parser, informed with data from the LR
parser, achieves better accuracy in twelwe cases, sta-
tistically significantly better in eight.
The error analysis confirms that indeed the Rev2
parser is able to reduce the number of errors made on
long dependency links, which are a major weakness
of a deterministic Shift/Reduce parser. The accuracy
of the Rev2 parser might be further improved by
more sophisticated feature selection, choosing fea-
tures that better represent hints to the second parsing
stage.
3 Linear Voting Combination

RL parser and the Rev2 parser.
Instead of using a general algorithm for calcu-
lating the MST of a graph, we exploit the fact that
we are combining trees and hence we developed an
approximate algorithm that has O(kn) complexity,
where n is the number of nodes in a tree and k is the
number of trees being combined.
The algorithm builds the combined tree T incre-
mentally, starting from the empty tree. We will ar-
gue that an invariant of the algorithm is that the par-
tial result T is always a tree.
The algorithm exploits the notion of fringe F , i.e.
the set of arcs whose parent is in T and that can be
added to T without affecting the invariant. Initially
F consists of the roots of all trees to be combined.
The weight of each arc a in the fringe is the number
of parsers that predicted a.
At each step, the algorithm selects from F an arc
a = (h, d, r) among those with maximum weight,
having h ? T . Then it:
1. adds a to T
2. removes from F all arcs whose child is d
3. adds to F all arcs (h?, d?, r?) in the original trees
where h? ? T and d? /? T .
Step 3 guarantees that no cycles are present in T .
The final T is connected because each added node
is connected to a node in T . T is a local maximum
because if there were another tree with higher score
including arc (h, n, r), either it is present in T or its
weight is smaller than the weight for node (h?, n, r?)
in T , as chosen by the algorithm.
The algorithm hasO(kn) complexity. A sketch of
the proof can be given as follows. Step 3 guarantees
that the algorithm is iterated n times, where n is the
number of nodes in a component tree. Using appro-
priate data structures to represent the fringe F , in-
sert or delete operations take constant time. At each
iteration of the algorithm the maximum number of
removals from F (step 2) is constant and it is equal
to k, hence the overall cost is O(nk).
Table 2 shows the results for the three languages
from CoNLL 2007. With respect to the best results
at the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task, the linear parser
combination achieves the best LAS for Czech and
Italian, the second best for English.
The results for the CoNLL-X languages (Table 3)
show also improvements: the Rev2 parser is more
263
accurate than MST, except for Bulgarian, Dutch,
German, and Spanish, where the difference is within
1%, and it is often better than the MaltMST stacking.
The improvements of the Rev2 over the LR parser
range from 0.38% for Chinese to 3.84% for Dutch.
The column CombMST shows the results of com-
bining parsers using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds MST al-
gorithm and the same weighting scheme of Lin-
ear Combination algorithm. For most languages
the Linear Combination algorithm leads to a bet-
ter accuracy than the MST algorithm. The some-
what surprising result might be due indeed to the top
down processing of the algorithm: since the algo-
rithm chooses the best among the connections that
are higher in the parse tree, this leads to a prefer-
ence to long spanning links over shorter links even
if these contribute higher weights to the MST.
Finally, the run time of the linear combination al-
gorithm on the whole CoNLL-X test set is 11.2 sec,
while the MST combination requires 92.5 sec.
We also tested weights based on the accuracy
score of each parser for the POS of an arc head, but
this produced less accurate results.
4 Conclusions
We presented a method for improving the accuracy
of a dependency parser by using a parser that ana-
lyzes a sentence in reverse using hints from the trees
produced by a forward parser.
We also introduced a new linear algorithm to per-
form parser combination.
Experiments on the corpora of languages from
the CoNLL-X and the CoNLL 2007 shared tasks
show that reverse revision parsing improves the ac-
curacy over a transition-based dependency parser in
all the tested languages. Further improvements are
obtained by using a linear parser combination algo-
rithm on the outputs of three parsers: a LR parser, a
RL parser and a Rev2 parser.
The combination parser achieves accuracies that
are best or second best with respect to the results
of the CoNLL 2007 shared task. Since all the indi-
vidual parsers as well as the combination algorithm
is linear, the combined parser maintains an overall
linear computational time. On the languages from
the CoNLL-X shared task the combination parser
achieves often the best accuracy in ten out of thirteen
languages but falls short of the accuracy achieved
by integrating a graph-based with a transition based
parser.
We expect that further tuning of the method might
help reduce these differences.

Abstract 
In this paper, we discuss an applic ation of 
Maximum Entropy to modeling the acqui-
sition of subject and object processing in 
Italian. The model is able to learn from 
corpus data a set of experimentally and 
theoretically well-motivated linguistic 
constraints, as well as their relative sali-
ence in Italian grammar development and 
processing. The model is also shown to 
acquire robust syntactic generalizations 
by relying on the evidence provided by a 
small number of high token frequency 
verbs only. These results are consistent 
with current research focusing on the role 
of high frequency verbs in allowing chil-
dren to converge on the most salient con-
straints in the grammar. 
1 Introduction 
Current research in language learning supports the 
view that developing grammatical competence in-
volve mastering and integrating multiple, parallel, 
probabilistic constraints defined over different 
types of linguistic (and non linguistic) information 
(Seidenberg and MacDonald 1999, MacWhinney 
2004). This is particularly clear when we focus on 
the core of grammatical deve lopment, namely the 
ability to properly identify syntactic relations. Psy-
cholinguistic evidence shows that children learn to 
identify sentence subjects and direct objects by 
combining various types of probabilistic cues, such 
as word order, noun animacy, definiteness, agree-
ment, etc. The relative prominence of each of these 
cues during the development of a child?s syntactic 
competence can considerably vary cross-
linguistically, mirroring their relative salience in 
the adult grammar system (cf. Bates et al 1984). 
If grammatical constraints are inherently prob-
abilistic (Manning 2003), the path through which 
the child acquires adult grammar competence can 
be viewed as the process of building a stochastic 
model out of the linguistic input. Consistently with 
?usage-based? approaches to language acquisition 
(cf. Tomasello, 2000) grammatical constraints 
would thus emerge from language use thanks to the 
child?s ability to keep track of statistical regulari-
ties in linguistic cues. In turn, this raises the issue 
of how children are able to exploit the statistical 
distribution of cues in the linguistic input. Various 
types of cross-linguistic evidence converge on the 
hypothesis that children are actually able to take 
great advantage of the highly skewed distribution 
of naturalistic language data. Goldberg et al 
(2004), Matthews et al (2003), Ninio (1999) 
among the others argue that verbs with high token 
frequency in the input have a facilitatory effect in 
allowing children to derive robust syntactic gener-
alizations even from surprisingly minimal input. 
According to this model, syntactic learning is 
driven by a small pool of verbs occurring with the 
highest token frequency: they approximately corre-
spond to so-called ?light verbs? such as English 
go, give , want etc. These verbs would act as ?cata-
72
lysts? in allowing children to converge on the most 
salient grammar constraints of the language they 
are acquiring. 
In computational linguistics, Maximum Entropy 
models have proven to be robust statistical learning 
algorithms that perform well in a number of proc-
essing tasks (cf. Ratnaparkhi 1998). In this paper, 
we discuss successful application of a Maximum 
Entropy (ME) model to the processing of Italian 
syntactic relations. We believe that this discussion 
is of general interest for two basic reasons. First, 
the model is able to learn, from corpus data, a set 
of experimentally and theoretically well-motivated 
linguistic constraints, as well as their relative sali-
ence in the processing of Italian. This suggests that 
it is possible for a child to bootstrap and use this 
type of knowledge on the basis of a specific distri-
bution of real language data, a conclusion that 
bears on the question of the role and type of innate 
inductive biases. Secondly, the model is also 
shown to acquire robust syntactic generalizations 
by relying on the evidence provided by a small 
number of high token frequency verbs only. With 
some qualifications, this evidence sheds light on 
the interaction between highly skewed language 
data distributions and language maturation. Robust 
grammar generalizations emerge on the basis of 
exposure to early, statist ically stable and lexically 
underspecified evidence, thus providing a reliable 
backbone to children?s syntactic development and 
later lexical organization.  
In the following section we first broach the 
general problem of parsing subjects and objects in 
Italian. Section 3 describes an ME model of the 
problem. Section 4 and 5 are devoted to a detailed 
empirical analysis of the interaction of different 
feature configurations and of the interplay between 
verb token frequency and relevant generalizations. 
Conclusions are drawn in the final discussion. 
2 Subjects and Objects in Italian 
Children that learn how to process subjects and 
objects in Italian are confronted with a twofold 
challenge: i) the relatively free order of Italian sen-
tence constituents and ii) the possible absence of 
an overt subject. The existence of a preferred Sub-
ject Verb Object (SVO) order in Italian main 
clauses does not rule out all other possible permu-
tations of these units: in fact, they are all attested, 
albeit with considerable differences in distribution 
and degree of markedness (Bartolini et al 2004).1 
Moreover, because of pro-drop, an Italian Verb 
Noun (VN) sequence can either be interpreted as a 
VO construction with subject omission (e.g. ha 
dichiarato guerra ?(he) declared war?) or as an 
instance of postverbal subject (VS, e.g. ha di-
chiarato Giovanni ?John declared?). Symmetri-
cally, an NV sequence is potentially ambiguous 
between SV and OV: compare il bambino ha man-
giato  ?the child ate? with il gelato ha mangiato ?the 
ice-cream, (he) ate?. 
These grammatical facts are in keeping with 
what we know about Italian children?s parsing 
strategies. Bates et al (1984) show that while, in 
English, word order is by and large the most effec-
tive cue for subject-object identification (hence-
forth SOI) both in syntactic processing and during 
the child?s syntactic development, the same cue 
plays second fiddle in Italian. Bates and colleagues 
bring empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis 
that Italian children show extreme reliance on NV 
agreement and, secondly, on noun animacy, rather 
than word order. They conclude that the following 
syntactic constraints dominance hierarchy is opera-
tive in Italian: agreement > animacy > word order. 
The fact that animacy can reliably be resorted 
to in Italian SOI receives indirect confirmation 
from corpus data. We looked at the distribution of 
animate subjects and objects in the Italian Syntac-
tic Semantic Treebank (ISST, Montemagni et al, 
2003), a 300,000 tokens syntactically annotated 
corpus, including articles from contemporary Ita l-
ian newspapers and periodicals covering a broad 
variety of topics. Subjects and objects in ISST 
were automatically annotated for animacy using 
the SIMPLE Italian computational lexicon (Lenci 
et al 2000) as a background semantic resource. 
The annotation was then checked manually. Cor-
pus analysis highlights a strong asymmetry in the 
distribution of animate nouns in subject and object 
roles: over 56.6% of ISST subjects are animate 
(out of a total number of 12,646), while only the 
11.1% of objects are animate (out of a total number 
of 5,559). Such an overwhelming preference for 
inanimate ob jects in adult language data makes 
animacy play a very important role in SOI, both as 
a key developmental factor in the bootstrapping of 
the syntax-semantics mapping and as a reliable

clarative main clauses. 
73
processing cue, consistently with psycholinguistic 
data. 
On the other hand, the distribution of word or-
der configurations in the same corpus shows an-
other interesting asymmetry. NV sequences receive 
an SV interpretation in 95.6% of the cases, and an 
object interpretation in the remaining 4.4% (most 
of which are clitic and relative pronouns, whose 
preverbal pos ition is grammatically constrained). 
The situation is quite different when we turn to VN 
sequences, where verb-object pairs represent 
73.4% of the cases, with verb-subject pairs repre-
senting the remaining 26.6%. We infer that ? at 
least in standard written Italian ? VS is a much 
more consistently used construction than OV, and 
that the role of word order in Italian parsing is not 
a marginal one across the board, but rather relative 
to VN contexts only. In NV constructions there is a 
strong preference for a subject interpretation, and 
this suggests a more dynamic dominance hierarchy 
of Italian syntactic constraints than the one pro-
vided above. 
As for agreement, it represents conclusive evi-
dence for SOI only when a nominal constituent and 
a verb do not agree in number and/or person (as in 
leggono il libro ?(they) read the book?). On the 
contrary, when noun and verb share the same per-
son and number the impact of agreement on SOI is 
neutralised, as in il bambino legge il libro ?the 
child reads the book? or in ha dichiarato il presi-
dente ?the president declared?. Although this ambi-
guity arises in specific contexts (i.e. when the verb 
is used in the third person singular or plural and the 
subject/object candidate agrees with it), it is inter-
esting to note that in ISST: third person verb forms 
cover 95.6% of all finite verb forms; and, more 
interestingly for our present concerns, 87.9% of all 
VN and NV pairs involving a third person verb 
form contains an agreeing noun. From this we con-
clude that the contribution of agreement to our 
problem is fairly limited, as lack  of agreement 
shows up only in a limited number of contexts. 
All in all, corpus data lend support to the idea 
that in Italian SOI is governed by a complex inter-
play of probabilistic constraints of a different na-
ture (morpho-syntactic, semantic, word order etc.). 
Moreover, distributional asymmetries in language 
data seem to provide a fairly reliable statistical ba-
sis upon which relevant probabilistic constraints 
can be bootstrapped and combined consistently. In 
the following section we shall present a ME model 
of how constraints and their interaction can be 
bootstrapped from language data. 
3 A Maximum Entropy model of SOI 
The Maximum Entropy (ME) framework offers a 
mathematically  sound way to build a probabilistic 
model for SOI, which combines different linguistic 
cues. Given a linguistic context c and an outcome 
a?A that depends on c, in the ME framework the 
conditional probability distribution p(a|c) is esti-
mated on the basis of the assumption that no a pri-
ori constraints must be met other than those related 
to a set of features f j(a,c) of c, whose distribution is 
derived from the training data. It can be proven 
that the probability distribution p satisfying the 
above assumption is the one with the highest en-
tropy, is unique and has the following exponential 
form (Berger et al 1996): 
(1) ?
=
=
k
j
cajf
jcZ
cap
1
),(
)(
1)|( a  
where Z(c) is a normalization factor, f j(a,c) are the 
values of k features of the pair (a,c) and correspond 
to the linguistic cues of c that are relevant to pre-
dict the outcome a. Features are extracted from the 
training data and define the constraints that the 
probabilistic model p must satisfy. The parameters 
of the distribution a1, ?, ak correspond to weights 
associated with the features, and determine the 
relevance of each feature in the overall model. In 
the experiments reported below feature weights 
have been estimated with the Generative Iterative 
Scaling (GIS) algorithm implemented in the AMIS 
software (Miyao and Tsujii 2002). 
We model SOI as the task of predicting the cor-
rect syntactic function f  ? {subject, object} of a 
noun occurring in a given syntactic context s. This 
is equivalent to build the conditional probability 
distribution p(f |s) of having a syntactic function f  
in a syntactic context s . Adopting the ME ap-
proach, the distribution p can be rewritten in the 
parametric form of (1), with features correspond-
ing to the linguistic contextual cues relevant to 
SOI. The context s  is a pair <vs , ns>, where vs is 
the verbal head and ns its nominal dependent in s. 
This notion of s departs from more traditional 
ways of describing an SOI context as a triple of 
one verb and two nouns in a certain syntactic con-
figuration (e.g, SOV or VOS, etc.). In fact, we as-
sume that SOI can be stated in terms of the more 
74
local task of establishing the grammatical function 
of a noun n observed in a verb-noun pair. This 
simplifying assumption is consistent with the claim 
in MacWhinney et al (1984) that SVO word order 
is actually derivative from SV and VO local pat-
terns and downplays the role of the transitive com-
plex construction in sentence processing. Evidence 
in favour of this hypothesis also comes from cor-
pus data: in ISST, there are 4,072 complete sub-
ject-verb-object-configurations, a small number if 
compared to the 11,584 verb tokens appearing with 
either a subject or an object only. Due to the com-
parative sparseness of canonical SVO constructions 
in Italian, it seems more reasonable to assume that 
children should pay a great deal of attention to 
both SV and VO units as cues in sentence percep-
tion (Matthews et al 2004). Reconstruction of the 
whole lexical SVO pattern can accordingly be seen 
as the end point of an acquisition process whereby 
smaller units are re-analyzed as being part of more 
comprehensive constructions. This hypothesis is 
more in line with a distributed view of canonical 
constructions as derivative of more basic local po-
sitional patterns, working together to yield more 
complex and abstract constructions. Last but not 
least, assuming verb-noun pairs as the relevant 
context for SOI allows us to simultaneously model 
the interaction of word order variation with pro-
drop in Italian. 
4 Feature selection 
The most important part of any ME model is the 
selection of the context features whose weights are 
to be estimated from data distributions. Our feature 
selection strategy is grounded on the main assump-
tion that features should correspond to linguisti-
cally and psycholinguistically well-motivated 
contextual cues. This allows us to evaluate the 
probabilistic model also with respect to its ability 
to replicate psycholinguistic experimental results 
and to be consistent with linguistic generalizations. 
Features are binary functions fki,f  (f ,s), which 
test whether a certain cue ki for the function f  oc-
curs in the context s . For our ME model of SOI, 
we have selected the following types of features: 
Word order tests the position of the noun wrt the 
verb, for instance: 
(2)
?
?
? ==
otherwise
postposnounif
subjf subjpost 0
.1
),(,
ss  
Animacy  tests whether the noun in s  is animate or 
inanimate (cf. ?.2). The centrality of this cue in 
Italian is widely supported by psycholinguistic 
evidence. Another source of converging evidence 
comes from functional and typological linguistic 
research. For instance, Aissen (2003) argues for 
the universal value of the following hierarchy rep-
resenting the relative markedness of the associa-
tions between grammatical functions and animacy 
degrees (with each item in these scale been less 
marked than the elements to its right): 
Animacy Markedness Hierarchy 
Subj/Human > Subj/Animate > Subj/Inanimate 
Obj/Inanimate > Obj/Animate > Obj/Human 
Markedness hierarchies have also been interpreted 
as probabilistic constraints estimated form corpus 
data (Bresnan et al 2001, ?vrelid 2004). In our 
ME model we have used a reduced version of the 
animacy markedness hierarchy in which human 
and animate nouns have been both subsumed under 
the general class animate. 
Definiteness tests the degree of ?referentiality? of 
the noun in a context pair s . Like for animacy, 
definiteness has been claimed to be associated with 
grammatical functions, giving rise to the following 
universal markedness hierarchy Aissen (2003): 
Definiteness Markedness Hierarchy 
Subj/Pro > Subj/Name > Subj/Def > Subj/Indef 
Obj/Indef > Obj/Def > Obj/Name > Obj/Pro 
According to this hierarchy, subjects with a low 
degree of definiteness are more marked than sub-
jects with a high degree of definiteness (for objects 
the reverse pattern holds). Given the importance 
assigned to the definiteness markedness hierarchy 
in current linguistic research, we have included the 
definiteness cue in the ME model. It is worth re-
marking that, unlike animacy, in psycholinguistic 
experiments definiteness has not been assigned any 
effective role in SOI. This makes testing this cue in 
a computational model even more interesting, as a 
way to evaluate its effective contribution to Italian 
SOI. In our experiments, we have used a ?com-
pact? version of the definiteness scale: the defi-
niteness cue tests whether the noun in the context 
75
pair i) is a name or a pronoun ii) has a definite arti-
cle iii), has an indefinite article or iv) is a ?bare? 
noun (i.e. with no article). It is worth saying that 
?bare? nouns are usually placed at the bottom end 
of the definiteness scale. 
The three types of features above only refer to 
nominal cues in the context pairs. Nevertheless, 
specific lexical properties of the verb can also be 
resorted to in SOI. The probability for ns to be sub-
ject or object may also depend on the specific lexi-
cal preferences of vs. To take this lexical factor 
into account, we add a set of lexical cues to the 
three general feature types above. Lexical cues test 
animacy with respect to a specific verb vk:

),(,,
sss  
Lexical features provide evidence of the propensity 
of a given verb to have an animate (inanimate) 
subject or object. In fact, the verb argument struc-
ture and thematic properties may well influence the 
possible distribution of animate (inanimate) sub-
jects and objects, thus overriding more general 
tendencies. By including lexical cues, we are thus 
able to test the interplay of lexical constraints with 
general grammatical ones. 
Note that in our ME model we have not in-
cluded agreement as a feature, in spite of its 
prominent role in Italian. The fact that agreement 
is often inconclusive for SOI (?.2) suggests that 
children must also acquire the ability to deal with 
the interplay of various concurrent constraints, 
none of which is singularly sufficient for the task 
completion this type of competence. It is exactly 
this area of syntactic competence that we wanted to 
explore with the experiments reported below (cf. 
MacWhinney et al 1984, who similarly abstract 
from the dominant role of case in German SOI). 
5 Testing feature configurations for SOI 
The ME model for Italian SOI has been trained on 
18,205 verb-subject/object pairs extracted from 
ISST. The training set was obtained by extracting 
all verb-subject and verb-object dependencies 
headed by an active verb occurring in a finite ver-
bal construction and by excluding all cases where 
the position of the nominal constituent was gram-
matically constrained (e.g. clitic objects, relative 
clauses). Two different feature configurations have 
been used for training: 
-  non-lexical feature configuration (NLC), in-
cluding only general features acting as global 
constraints: namely word order, noun animacy 
and noun definiteness; 
- lexical feature configuration (LC), including 
word order, noun animacy and definiteness, 
and information about the verb head.  
The test corpus consists of 645 verb-noun pairs 
extracted from contexts where agreement happens 
to be neutralized. Of them, 446 contained a subject 
(either pre- or post-verbal) and 199 contained an 
object (either pre- or post-verbal). The two feature 
configurations were evaluated by calculating the 
percentage of correctly assigned relations over the 
total number of test pairs (accuracy). As our model 
always assigns one syntactic relation to each test 
pair, accuracy equals both standard precision and 
recall. Finally, we have assumed a baseline score 
of 69%, corresponding to the result yielded by a 
dumb model assigning to each test pair the most 
frequent relation in the training corpus, i.e. subject. 
5.1 Non-lexical feature configuration 
Our first experiment was carried out with NLC. 
The accuracy on the test corpus is 91.5%; most 
errors (i.e. 96.4%) relate to the postverbal position, 
with 44 mistaken subjects (42 inanimate) and 9 
mistaken objects (all animate). The score was con-
firmed by a 10-fold cross-validation on the whole 
training set (89.3% accuracy). 
A further way to evaluate the goodness of the 
model is by inspecting the weights associated with 
feature values (Table 1). 
 Subj Obj 
Preverbal 1,34E+00 2,10E-02 
Postverbal 5,21E-01 1,47E+00 
Anim 1,28E+00 3,34E-01 
Inanim 8,60E-01 1,21E+00 
PronName  1,22E+00 5,75E-01 
DefArt 1,05E+00 1,00E+00 
IndefArt 8,33E-01 1,16E+00 
NoArticle 9,46E-01 1,07E+00 
Table 1 ? Feature value weights in NLC  
The grey cells in Table 1 highlight the preference 
of each feature value for either subject or object 
identif ication: e.g. preverbal subjects are strongly 
preferred over preverbal objects; animate subjects 
76
are preferred over animate objects, etc. Interest-
ingly, if we rank the Anim and Inanim values for 
subjects and objects, we can observe tha t they dis-
tribute consistently with the Animacy Markedness 
Hierarchy reported in ?.4: Subj /Anim > 
Subj/Inanim and Obj/Inanim > Obj/Anim. Simi-
larly, by ranking the values of the definiteness fea-
tures in the Subj column by decreasing weight 
values we obtain the following ordering: Pron-
Name > DefArt > IndefArt > NoArt, which nicely 
fits in with the Definiteness Markedness Hierarchy 
in ?.4. The so-called ?markedness reversal? is ob-
served if we focus on the values for the same fea-
tures in the Obj column: the PronName feature 
represents the most marked option, followed by 
DefArt. The only exception is represented by the 
relative ordering of IndefArt and NoArt which 
however show very close values. 
Evaluating feature salience 
In order to evaluate the most reliable cues in Italian 
SOI, we have analysed the model predictions for 
different bundles of feature values. For each of the 
16 different bundles (b) attested in the data, we 
have estimated p(subj|b) and p(obj|b): 
b p(subj|b) p(obj|b) 
Pre Anim IndefArt 0,994 0,006
Pre Anim DefArt 0,996 0,004
Pre Anim NoArt 0,995 0,005
Pre Anim PronName 0,998 0,002
Pre Inanim IndefArt 0,970 0,030
Pre Inanim DefArt 0,979 0,021
Pre Inanim NoArt 0,976 0,024
Pre Inanim PronName 0,990 0,010
Post Anim IndefArt 0,495 0,505
Post Anim DefArt 0,589 0,411
Post Anim NoArt 0,546 0,454
Post Anim PronName  0,743 0,257
Post Inanim IndefArt 0,153 0,847
Post Inanim DefArt 0,209 0,791
Post Inanim NoArt 0,182 0,818
Post Inanim PronName 0,348 0,652
Table 2 ? Subj/obj probabilities by different bundles 
The model shows a neat preference for subject 
when the noun is preverbal. Instead, when the noun 
is postverbal, function assignment is de facto de-
cided by the noun animacy. Conversely, definite-
ness features have a much more secondary role: 
they can re-enforce (or weaken) the preference ex-
pressed by animacy, but they do not have the 
strength to determine SOI. 
The relative salience of the different constraints 
acting on SOI can also be inferred by comparing 
the weights associated with individual feature val-
ues. For instance, Goldwater and Johnson (2003) 
show that ME can be successfully applied to learn 
constraint rankings in Optimality Theory, by as-
suming the parameter weights a1, ?, ak as the 
ranking values of the constraints. The following 
table lists the 16 general constraints of the model 
by increasing weight values: 
 
Feature Weight 
Preverbal_Obj 2,10E-02
Anim_Obj 3,34E-01
Postverbal_Subj 5,21E-01
ProName_Obj 5,75E-01
IndefArt_Subj 8,33E-01
Inanim_Subj 8,60E-01
NoArticle_Subj 9,46E-01
ArtDef_Obj 1,00E+00
DefArt_Subj 1,05E+00
NoArticle_Obj 1,07E+00
IndefArt_Obj 1,16E+00
Inanim_Obj 1,21E+00
PronName_Subj 1,22E+00
Anim_Subj 1,28E+00
Preverbal_Subj 1,34E+00
Postverbal_Obj 1,47E+00
Table 3 ? Constraint weights ranking 
The rankings in Table 3 can be used to derive the 
relative salience of each constraint. Lower ranked 
constraints correspond to more marked syntactic 
configurations that are then disfavoured in SOI. 
Notice that the two animacy constraints Anim_Obj 
and Anim_Subj are respectively placed near the 
bottom and the top end of the scale. Notwithstand-
ing the low position of Postverbal_Subj, animacy 
is thus able to override the word order constraint 
and to produce a strong tendency to identify ani-
mate nouns as subjects, even when they appear in 
postverbal position (cf. Table 2 above). The con-
straint ranking thus confirms the interplay between 
animacy and word order in Italian, with the former 
playing a decisive role in assigning the syntactic 
function of postverbal nouns. On the other hand, 
77
the constraints involving noun definiteness occupy 
a more intermediate position in the general rank-
ing, with very close values. This is again consistent 
with the less decisive role of this feature type in 
SOI, as shown above. 
5.2 Lexical feature configuration 
In this experiment the general features reported in 
Table 1 have been integrated with 4,316 verb-
specific features as the ones exemplified below for 
the verb dire ?say?: 
dire_animSog 1.228213e+00 
dire_noanimSog 7.028484e-01 
dire_animOgg 3.645964e-01 
dire_noanimOgg 1.321887e+00 
whose associated weights show the strong prefer-
ence of this verb to take animate subjects as op-
posed to inanimate ones as well as a preference for 
inanimate objects with respect to animate ones. 
The results achieved with LC on the test corpus 
show a significant improvement with respect to 
those obtained with NLC: the accuracy is now 
95.5%, with a  4% improvement, confirmed by a 
10-fold cross-validation (94.9%). Also in this case, 
most of the errors relate to the pos tverbal position 
(i.e. 27 out of 29), partitioned into 26 mistaken 
subjects and 1 mistaken object. Lexical features 
have been resorted to to solve most of the NLC 
errors (i.e. 34 out of 55). It is interesting to note 
however that lexical features can also be mislead-
ing. The LC results include 8 new errors, suggest-
ing that lexical features do not always provide 
conclusive evidence: in fact, in 185 cases out of 
645 test VN pairs (i.e. 28.7% of the cases) general 
features are preferred over lexical ones. It is also 
worth mentioning that the ranking of general ani-
macy and definiteness features in LC actually fits 
in with the respective markedness hierarchies even 
with a better approximation than the one produced 
by NLC.  Finally, the relative prominence of the 
different global features confirms the trend in Ta-
ble 2, with word order being predominant in pre-
verbal pos ition and animacy playing a major role 
with postverbal nouns. 
Both feature configurations of the ME model 
thus appear to comply with linguistic and psycho-
linguistic generalizations on SOI. On the linguistic 
side, the constraints learnt by the model are consis-
tent with universal markedness hierarchies for 
grammatical relations. Secondly, the prominence 
of the various constraints in the model fits in well 
with psycholinguistic data. Consistently with the 
results in Bates et al (1984), the model confirms 
the great impact of noun animacy in Italian, al-
though in this case its key role seems to be more 
directly limited to the postverbal position. Con-
versely, the preverbal position is by itself a very 
strong cue for subject interpretation. 
6 High frequency verbs and SOI  
Frequency is known to play a major influence in 
language learning. In morphology, for example, 
highly frequent lexical items tend to be shorter 
forms, more readily accessible in the mental lexi-
con, independently stored as whole items (Stem-
berger and MacWhinney 1986) and fairly resistant 
to morphological overgeneralization through time, 
thus establishing a correlation between irregular 
inflected forms and frequency. Frequency has also 
been assigned a key role in the acquisition of syn-
tactic constructions. In fact, Goldberg (1998) and 
Ninio (1999) have independently argued for the 
existence of a causal relation between early expo-
sure to highly frequent light verbs and acquisition 
of abstract syntax-semantics mappings (construc-
tions). Light verbs such as want, put and go tend to 
be very frequent, because they are applicable in a 
wider range of contexts and are learned and used at 
an early language maturation stage The main idea 
is that children?s early use of these high frequency 
verbs is conducive to the acquisition of abstract 
constructional properties generalizing over particu-
lar instances. 
Goldberg et al (2004) motivate this hypothesis 
by observing that light verbs have high input fre-
quency in the child?s developmental environment 
and, at the same time, exhibit a low degree of se-
mantic specialization. Hence, she argues, it takes a 
little abstraction step for a child to jump from ac-
tual instances of use of light verbs to the syntax-
semantics association of their underlying construc-
tion. On the other hand, Ninio (1999) grounds the 
facilitatory role of highly frequent verbs on their 
being ?pathbreaking? prototypes of the construc-
tion they instantiate, since they are the best models 
of the relevant combinatorial and semantic proper-
ties of their construction in a relatively undiluted 
fashion. However, in the case of light verb con-
structions, the correlation between high frequency 
78
and construction prototypicality and extension is 
tenuous. In fact, it is difficult to argue that frequent 
light verbs such as see, want or do exhibit a high 
degree of both semantic and constructional trans i-
tivity (Goldberg et al 2004). This is reminiscent of 
the morphological behaviour of very frequent word 
forms in inflectional languages, as most of these 
forms are highly fused and show a general ten-
dency towards irregular inflection and low mor-
phological prototypicality. Furthermore, it is 
difficult to reconcile the ?pathbreaking? view with 
the observation that frequently observed linguistic 
units are memorized in full, as unanalyzed wholes. 
6.1 Testing the role of frequency 
To address these open issues and put the alleged 
?pathbreaking? role of light verbs to the challeng-
ing test of a probabilistic model, we carried out a 
second battery of experiments to learn the general, 
non-lexical constraints from two training corpora 
of roughly equivalent size where overall type and 
token verb frequencies were controlled for. Both 
corpora are a subset of the original training set: 
1. skewed frequency corpus (SF) ? it includes 
5,261 context pairs, obtained by selecting 15 verbs 
occurring more than 100 times in ISST (figures in 
parentheses give their token frequency): essere 
?be? (2406), avere ?have? (708), fare  ?do, make? 
(527), dire ?say, tell? (275), dare ?give? (173), ve-
dere ?see? (134), andare ?go? (126), sembrare 
?seem? (124), cercare ?try? (122), mettere ?put? 
(122), portare ?take? (121), trovare ?find? (112), 
volere ?want? (105), lasciare ?leave? (105), riuscire 
?manage? (101). It is worth noticing that this set 
includes typical ?pathbreaking? verbs; 
2. balanced frequency corpus (BF) ? this corpus 
includes 5,373 context pairs selected in such a way 
to ensure that every verb type in the original train-
ing set is attested in BF and occurs at most 6 times. 
For verbs occurring with a higher frequency, the 
pairs to be included in BF have been randomly se-
lected. 
Thus SF and BF represent two opposite training 
situations: SF contains few types with very high 
token frequencies, while BF contains a high num-
ber of verb types (i.e. 1457), with very low and 
uniform token frequency. These training sets re-
semble the structure of linguistic input used by 
Goldberg et al (2004) for their experiments. In 
that case, one group of subjects was exposed to 
linguistic inputs in which some verbs occurred 
with a much higher frequency than the others; a 
second group of subjects was instead exposed to 
linguistic stimuli in which every verb occurred 
with roughly equal frequency. Therefore, by train-
ing our ME model on SF and BF we are able  to 
evaluate the effective role of high token frequency 
verbs in driving syntactic learning.  
The ME model with the general features only 
(i.e. NLC) was first trained on SF, and then tested 
on the 645-pair corpus in ?.5, showing a 90% ac-
curacy. The same ME model was then trained on 
BF, and then tested on the 645-pair corpus, scoring 
a 87% accuracy. The ME model trained on the 
skewed frequency data thus outperforms the model 
trained on BF in a statistically significant way (?2 = 
4.97; a=0.05; p-value = 0.025). 
By using a training set formed only by the verbs 
with the highest token frequency, the model has 
thus been able to acquire robust syntactic con-
straints for SOI. Once these constraints have been 
applied to unseen events, the model has achieved a 
performance comparable to the one of the general 
models in ?.5. This is somehow even more signif i-
cant if we consider that the training set was now 
formed by less than one-third of the pairs on which 
the models in ?.5 were trained. Data quantity aside, 
the most relevant fact is that it is the way verb fre-
quencies are distributed to determine the learning 
path, with a significant positive effect produced by 
high token frequency verbs. In the model trained 
on SF, feature ranking is also governed by mark-
edness relations, and the relative prominence of the 
various constraints is utterly similar to the one dis-
cussed in ?.5. In other terms, the results of this ex-
periment prove that frequent verbs are actually 
able to act as ?catalysts? of the syntactic acquis i-
tion process. It is possible for children to converge 
on the correct generalizations governing SOI in 
Italian, just by relying on the linguistic evidence 
provided by the most frequent verbs. 
This view suggests a way out of the apparent 
paradox of the ?pathbreaking? hypothesis: highly 
frequent verbs can be assumed to provide stable 
and consistent multiple probabilistic cues for the 
assignment of subject/object relations. The exis-
tence of pos itional patterns that occur with high 
token frequency may well provide a deeply en-
trenched and highly salient set of distributional 
cues that act as probabilistic constraints on con-
structional generalizations. We hypothesize that 
similar constructions of other less frequent verbs 
79
are processed, for lack of more specific overriding 
information, in the light of these constraints. Since 
processing is the result of a ?conspiracy? of dis-
tributed constraints, ?pathbreaking? prototypes 
need not be real construction exemplars but highly 
schematic patterns. We proved that highly frequent 
local positional patterns offer the right sort of con-
straint conspiracy. 
7 General discussion 
It appears that the distributional evidence of high 
frequency light verbs may well provide a solid 
cognitive anchor for sweeping perceptual generali-
zations on the syntax-semantics mapping. These 
generalizations are local, in that they involve pos i-
tional NV and VN pairs only, and are perceptual as 
they address the issue of identifying appropriate 
syntactic relations by relying on perceptual fea-
tures of linguistic contexts, such as position, ani-
macy, etc. On the basis of these findings, one can 
reasonably argue that complex lexical construc-
tions (in the sense of Goldberg 1998) are built 
upon these local patterns, by combining them in 
those contexts where the presence of a particular 
verb licenses such a combination.  
The two feature configurations discussed in ?.5 
(i.e. NLC and LC) can thus be viewed as two suc-
cessive steps along the path that leads towards the 
emergence of complex, lexically-driven construc-
tions. This can actually be modeled as the incre-
mental process of adding more and more lexical 
constraints to early lexicon-free generalizations 
(based on word order, animacy, definiteness etc.). 
As a result of such additional constraints, the pres-
ence of an intransitive verb may completely rule 
out the object interpretation of a VN pattern, flying 
in the face of a general bias towards viewing VN as 
a transitive pattern. This picture is compatible with 
the well-known observation that constructions are 
used rather conservatively by children at early 
stages of language maturation (Tomasello 2000). 
In fact, if early generalizations are mainly percep-
tual and local, we do not expect them to be used in 
production, at least until the child reaches a stage 
where they are combined into bigger lexically-
driven constructions. 
ME has proven to be a sound computational 
learning framework to simulate the interplay of 
complex probabilistic constraints in language. Our 
experiments confirm linguistic generalizations and 
psycholinguistic data for subjects and objects in 
Italian, while raising new interesting issues at the 
same time. This is the case of the role of definite-
ness in SOI. In fact, the model features neatly re-
produce the definiteness markedness hierarchy, but 
definiteness does not appear to be really influential 
for subject and object processing. Various hy-
potheses are compatible with such results, inclu d-
ing that definiteness is not a cue on which speakers 
rely for SOI in Italian. Another more interesting 
possibility is that definiteness constraints may in-
deed play a decisive role when the learner is asked 
to assign subject and object relations in the context 
of a more complex construction than a simple NV 
pair. Suppose that both nouns of a noun-noun-verb 
triple are amenable to a subject interpretation, but 
that one of them is a more likely subject than the 
other due to its being part of a definite noun 
phrase. Then, it is reasonable to expect that the 
model would select the definite noun phrase as the 
subject in the triple and opt for an object interpre-
tation of the other candidate noun phrase.  
As part of our future work, we plan to train the 
ME model on a more realistic corpus of parental 
input to Italian children, available in the CHILDES 
database (MacWhinney, 2000: http://childes.psy. 
cmu.edu/data/Romance/Italian). In fact, there is 
converging evidence that the use of particular con-
structions in parental speech is largely dominated 
by the use of each construction with one specific, 
highly frequent verb (e.g. go for the intransitive 
construction). The same trends noted in mother?s 
speech to children are mirrored in children?s early 
speech (Goldberg et al, 2004). Quochi (in prepara-
tion) reports a similar distributional pattern for the 
caused motion and intransitive motion verbs in two 
Italian CHILDES corpora (named ?Italian-
Antelmi? and ?Italian-Calambrone?). If these find-
ings are confirmed, the high accuracy of our ME 
model trained on the skewed frequency corpus 
(SF) allows us to expect an equally high accuracy 
when training the model on evidence from Italian 
parental speech.  
This brings us to another related point: lack of 
correction/supervision in parental input. Since our 
ME model heavily relies on previously classified 
noun-verb pairs, we can legitimately wonder how 
easily it can be extended to simulate child language 
learning in an unsupervised mode. In fact, it should 
be appreciated that, in our experiments, compar-
tively little rests on supervised classification. Iden-
80
tification of the contextually-relevant subject is, for 
lack of explicit morphosyntactic clues such as 
agreement and diathesis, simply a matter of guess-
ing the more likely agent of the action expressed 
by the verb on the basis of semantic and pragmatic 
features such as animacy, definiteness and noun 
position to the verb. Mutatis mutandis, the same 
holds for object identification. It is then highly 
likely that salient evidence for the correct sub-
ject/object classific ation comes to the child from 
direct observation of the situation described by a 
sentence. It is such systematic coupling of linguis-
tic evidence from the sentence with perceptual evi-
dence of the situation described by the sentence 
that can assist the child in developing interface 
notions such as subject, object and the like.

Abstract 
The paper reports on a detailed 
quantitative analysis of distributional 
language data of both Italian and Czech, 
highlighting the relative contribution of a 
number of distributed grammatical 
factors to sentence-based identification of 
subjects and direct objects. The work 
uses a Maximum Entropy model of 
stochastic resolution of conflicting 
grammatical constraints and is 
demonstrably capable of putting 
explanatory theoretical accounts to the 
test of usage-based empirical verification. 
1 Introduction 
The paper illustrates the application of a 
Maximum Entropy (henceforth MaxEnt) model 
(Ratnaparkhi 1998) to the processing of subjects 
and direct objects in Italian and Czech. The 
model makes use of richly annotated Treebanks 
to determine the types of linguistic factors 
involved in the task and weigh up their relative 
salience. In doing so,  we set ourselves a two-
fold goal. On the one hand, we intend to discuss 
the use of Treebanks to discover typologically 
relevant and linguistically motivated factors and 
assess the relative contribution of the latter to 
cross-linguistic parsing issues. On the other 
hand, we are interested in testing the empirical 
plausibility of constraint-resolution models of 
language processing (see infra) when confronted 
with real language data.  
Current research in natural language learning 
and processing supports the view that 
grammatical competence consists in mastering 
and integrating multiple, parallel constraints 
(Seidenberg and MacDonald 1999, MacWhinney 
2004). Moreover, there is growing consensus on 
two major properties of grammatical constraints: 
i.) they are probabilistic ?soft constraints? 
(Bresnan et al 2001), and ii.) they have an 
inherently functional nature, involving different 
types of linguistic (and non linguistic) 
information (syntactic, semantic, etc.). These 
features emerge particularly clearly in dealing 
with one of the core aspects of grammar 
learning: the ability to identify syntactic relations 
in text. Psycholinguistic evidence shows that 
speakers learn to identify sentence subjects and 
direct objects by combining various types of 
probabilistic, functional cues, such as word 
order, noun animacy, definiteness, agreement, 
etc. An important observation is that the relative 
prominence of each such cue can considerably 
vary cross-linguistically. Bates et al (1984), for 
example, argue that while, in English, word order 
is the most effective cue for Subject-Object 
Identification (henceforth SOI) both in syntactic 
processing and during the child?s syntactic 
development, the same cue plays second fiddle in 
relatively free phrase-order languages such as 
Italian or German. 
If grammatical constraints are inherently 
probabilistic (Manning 2003), the path through 
which adult grammar competence is acquired can 
be viewed as the process of building a stochastic 
model out of the linguistic input. In 
computational linguistics, MaxEnt models have 
21
proven to be robust statistical learning algorithms 
that perform well in a number of processing 
tasks. Being supervised learning models, they  
require richly annotated data as training input. 
Before we turn to the use of Treebanks for 
training a MaxEnt model for SOI, we first 
analyse the range of linguistic factors that are 
taken to play a significant role in the task.   
2 Subjects and objects in Czech and 
Italian 
Grammatical relations - such as subject (S) and 
direct object (O) - are variously encoded in 
languages, the two most widespread strategies 
being: i) structural encoding through word order, 
and ii) morpho-syntactic marking. In turn, 
morpho-syntactic marking can apply either on 
the noun head only, in the form of case 
inflections, or on both the noun and the verb, in 
the form of agreement marking (Croft 2003). 
Besides formal coding, the distribution of 
subjects and object is also governed by semantic 
and pragmatic factors, such as noun animacy, 
definiteness, topicality, etc. As a result, there 
exists a variety of linguistic clues jointly co-
operating in making a particular noun phrase the 
subject or direct object of a sentence. Crucially 
for our present purposes, cross-linguistic 
variation does not only concern the particular 
strategy used to encode S and O, but also the 
relative strength that each factor plays in a given 
language. For instance, while English word order 
is by and large the dominant clue to identify S 
and O, in other languages the presence of a rich 
morphological system allows word order to have 
a much looser connection with the coding of 
grammatical relations, thus playing a secondary 
role in their identification. Moreover, there are 
languages where semantic and pragmatic 
constraints such as animacy and/or definiteness 
play a predominant role in the processing of 
grammatical relations. A large spectrum of 
variations exists, ranging from languages where 
S must have a higher degree of animacy and/or 
definiteness relative to O, to languages where 
this constraint only takes the form of a softer 
statistical preference (cf. Bresnan et al 2001). 
The goal of this paper is to explore the area of 
this complex space of grammar variation through 
careful assessment of the distribution of S and O 
tokens in Italian and Czech. For our present 
analysis, we have used a MaxEnt statistical 
model trained on data extracted from two 
syntactically annotated corpora: the Prague 
Dependency Treebank (PDT, Bohmova et al 
2003) for Czech, and the Italian Syntactic 
Semantic Treebank (ISST, Montemagni et al 
2003) for Italian. These corpora have been 
chosen not only because they are the largest 
syntactically annotated resources for the two 
languages, but also because of their high degree 
of comparability, since they both adopt a 
dependency-based annotation scheme. 
Czech and Italian provide an interesting 
vantage point for the cross-lingual analysis of 
grammatical variation. They are both Indo-
European languages, but they do not belong to 
the same family: Czech is a West Slavonic 
language, while Italian is a Romance language. 
For our present concerns, they appear to share 
two crucial features: i) the free order of 
grammatical relations with respect to the verb; ii) 
the possible absence of an overt subject. 
Nevertheless, they also greatly differ due to: the 
virtual non-existence of case marking in Italian 
(with the only marginal exception of personal 
pronouns), and the degree of phrase-order 
freedom in the two languages. Empirical 
evidence supporting the latter claim is provided 
in Table 1, which reports data extracted from 
PDT and ISST. Notice that although in both 
languages S and O can occur either pre-verbally 
or post-verbally, Czech and Italian greatly differ 
in their propensity to depart from the (unmarked) 
SVO order. While in Italian preverbal O is 
highly infrequent (1.90%), in Czech more than 
30% of O tokens occur before the verb. The 
situation is similar but somewhat more balanced 
in the case of S, which occurs post-verbally in 
22.21% of the Italian cases, and  in  40% of 
Czech ones. For sure, one can argue that, in 
spoken Italian, the number of pre-verbal objects 
is actually higher, because of the greater number 
of left dislocations and topicalizations occurring 
in informal speech. However reasonable, the 
observation does not explain away the 
distributional differences in the two corpora, 
since both PDT and ISST contain written 
language only. We thus suggest that there is clear 
empirical evidence in favour of a systematic, 
higher phrase-order freedom in Czech, arguably 
related to the well-known correlation of Czech 
constituent placement with sentence information 
structure, with the element carrying new 
information showing a tendency to occur 
sentence-finally (Stone 1990). For our present 
concerns, however, aspects of information 
structure, albeit central in Czech grammar, were 
not taken into  account, as they  happen not to  be

Table 2 - Distribution of Czech S and O 
wrt case 
marked-up in the Italian corpus.  
According to the data reported in Table 1, 
Czech and Italian show similar correlation 
patterns between animacy and grammatical 
relations. S and O in ISST were automatically 
annotated for animacy using the SIMPLE Italian 
computational lexicon (Lenci et al 2000) as a 
background semantic resource. The annotation 
was then checked manually. Czech S and O were 
annotated for animacy using Czech WordNet 
(Pala and Smrz 2004); it is worth remarking that 
in Czech animacy annotation was done only 
automatically, without any manual revision. 
Italian shows a prominent asymmetry in the 
distribution of animate nouns in subject and 
object roles: over 50% of ISST subjects are 
animate, while only 10% of the objects are 
animate. Such a trend is also confirmed in Czech 
? although to a lesser extent - with 34.10% of 
animate subjects vs. 15.42% of objects.1 Such an 
overwhelming preference for animate subjects in 
corpus data suggests that animacy may play a 
very important role for S and O identification in 
both languages. 
Corpus data also provide interesting evidence 
concerning the actual role of morpho-syntactic 
constraints in the distribution of grammatical 
relations. Prima facie, agreement and case are 
the strongest and most directly accessible clues 
for S/O processing, as they are marked both 
overtly and locally. This is also confirmed by 
psycholinguistic evidence, showing that subjects 
tend to rely on these clues to identify S/O. 
However, it should be observed that agreement 
can be relied upon conclusively in S/O 
processing only when a nominal constituent and 
                                               
1 In fact, the considerable difference in animacy distribution 
between the two languages might only be an artefact of the 
way we annotated Czech nouns semantically, on the basis of 
their context-free classification in the Czech WordNet. 
a verb do not agree in number and/or person (as 
in leggono il libro ?(they) read the book?). 
Conversely, when N and V share the same 
person and number, no conclusion can be drawn, 
as trivially shown by a sentence like il bambino 
legge il libro ?the child reads the book?. In ISST, 
more than 58% of O tokens agree with their 
governing V, thus being formally 
indistinguishable from S on the basis of 
agreement features. PDT also exhibits a similar 
ratio, with 56% of O tokens agreeing with their 
verb head. Analogous considerations apply to 
case marking, whose perceptual reliability is 
undermined by morphological syncretism,  
whereby different  cases are realized through the 
same marker. Czech data reveal the massive 
extent of this phenomenon and its impact on SOI. 
As reported in Table 2, more than 56% of O 
tokens extracted from PDT are formally 
indistinguishable from S in case ending. 
Similarly, 45% of S tokens are formally 
indistinguishable from O uses on the same 
ground. All in all, this means that in 50% of the 
cases a Czech noun can not be understood as the 
S/O of a sentence by relying on overt case 
marking only. 
To sum up, corpus data lend support to the 
idea that in both Italian and in Czech SOI is 
governed by a complex interplay of probabilistic 
constraints of a different nature (morpho-
syntactic, semantic, word order, etc.) as the latter 
are neither singly necessary nor jointly sufficient 
to attack the processing task at hand. It is 
tempting to hypothesize that the joint distribution 
of these data can provide a statistically reliable 
basis upon which relevant probabilistic 
constraints are bootstrapped and combined 
consistently. This should be possible due to i) the 
different degrees of clue salience in the two 
languages and ii) the functional need to minimize 
23
processing ambiguity in ordinary communicative 
exchanges. With reference to the latter point, for 
example, we may surmise that a speaker will be 
more inclined to violate one constraint on S/O 
distribution (e.g. word order) when another clue 
is available (e.g. animacy) that strongly supports 
the intended interpretation only. The following 
section illustrates how a MaxEnt model can be 
used to model these intuitions by bootstrapping 
constraints and their interaction from language 
data. 
3 Maximum Entropy modelling 
The MaxEnt framework offers a mathematically 
sound way to build a probabilistic model for SOI, 
which combines different linguistic cues. Given 
a linguistic context c and an outcome a?A that 
depends on c, in the MaxEnt framework the 
conditional probability distribution p(a|c) is 
estimated on the basis of the assumption that no 
a priori constraints must be met other than those 
related to a set of features fj(a,c) of c, whose 
distribution is derived from the training data. It 
can be proven that the probability distribution p 
satisfying the above assumption is the one with 
the highest entropy, is unique and has the 
following exponential form (Berger et al 1996): 
(1) ?
=
=
k
j
caf
j
j
cZcap 1
),(
)(
1)|( a  
where Z(c) is a normalization factor, fj(a,c) are 
the values of k features of the pair (a,c) and 
correspond to the linguistic cues of c that are 
relevant to predict the outcome a. Features are 
extracted from the training data and define the 
constraints that the probabilistic model p must 
satisfy. The parameters of the distribution ?1, ?, 
?k correspond to weights associated with the 
features, and determine the relevance of each 
feature in the overall model. In the experiments 
reported below feature weights have been 
estimated with the Generative Iterative Scaling 
(GIS) algorithm implemented in the AMIS 
software (Miyao and Tsujii 2002). 
We model SOI as the task of predicting the 
correct syntactic function ? ? {subject, object} 
of a noun occurring in a given syntactic context 
?. This is equivalent to building the conditional 
probability distribution p(?|?) of having a 
syntactic function ? in a syntactic context ?. 
Adopting the MaxEnt approach, the distribution 
p can be rewritten in the parametric form of (1), 
with features corresponding to the linguistic 
contextual cues relevant to SOI. The context ? is 
a pair <v?, n?>, where v? is the verbal head and n? 
its nominal dependent in ?. This notion of ? 
departs from more traditional ways of describing 
an SOI context as a triple of one verb and two 
nouns in a certain syntactic configuration (e.g, 
SOV or VOS, etc.). In fact, we assume that SOI 
can be stated in terms of the more local task of 
establishing the grammatical function of a noun 
n observed in a verb-noun pair. This simplifying 
assumption is consistent with the claim in 
MacWhinney et al (1984) that SVO word order 
is actually derivative from SV and VO local 
patterns and downplays the role of the transitive 
complex construction in sentence processing. 
Evidence in favour of this hypothesis also comes 
from corpus data: for instance, in ISST complete 
subject-verb-object configurations represent only 
26% of the cases, a small percentage if compared 
to the 74% of verb tokens appearing with either a 
subject or an object only; a similar situation can 
be observed in PDT where complete subject-
verb-object configurations occur in only 20% of 
the cases. Due to the comparative sparseness of 
canonical SVO constructions in Czech and 
Italian, it seems more reasonable to assume that 
children should pay a great deal of attention to 
both SV and VO units as cues in sentence 
perception (Matthews et al in press). 
Reconstruction of the whole lexical SVO pattern 
can accordingly be seen as the end point of an 
acquisition process whereby smaller units are re-
analyzed as being part of more comprehensive 
constructions. This hypothesis is more in line 
with a distributed view of canonical 
constructions as derivative of more basic local 
positional patterns, working together to yield 
more complex and abstract constructions. Last 
but not least, assuming verb-noun pairs as the 
relevant context for SOI allows us to 
simultaneously model the interaction of word 
order variation with pro-drop. 
4 Feature selection 
The most important part of any MaxEnt model is 
the selection of the context features whose 
weights are to be estimated from data 
distributions. Our feature selection strategy is 
grounded on the main assumption that features 
should correspond to theoretically and 
typologically well-motivated contextual cues. 
This allows us to evaluate the probabilistic 
model also with respect to its consistency with 
current linguistic generalizations. In turn, the 
model can be used as a probe into the 
correspondence between theoretically motivated 
24
generalizations and usage-based empirical 
evidence.  
Features are binary functions fki,? (?,?), which 
test whether a certain cue ki for the feature ? 
occurs in the context ?. For our MaxEnt model, 
we have selected different features types that test 
morpho-syntactic, syntactic, and semantic key 
dimensions in determining the distribution of S 
and O. 
 
Morpho-syntactic features. These include N-V 
agreement, for Italian and Czech, and case, only 
for Czech. The combined use of such features 
allow us not only to test the impact of morpho-
syntactic information on SOI, but also to analyze 
patterns of cross-lingual variation stemming 
from language specific morphological 
differences, e.g. lack of case marking in Italian. 
 
Word order. This feature essentially test the 
position of the noun wrt the verb, for instance: 
(2)
??
? == otherwise
postposnounifsubjf subjpost 0
.1),(, ss  
 
Animacy. This is the main semantic feature, 
which tests whether the noun in ? is animate or 
inanimate (cf. section 2). The centrality of this 
cue for grammatical relation assignment is 
widely supported by typological evidence (cf. 
Aissen 2003, Croft 2003). The Animacy 
Markedness Hierarchy - representing the relative 
markedness of the associations between 
grammatical functions and animacy degrees ? is 
actually assigned the role of a functional 
universal principle in grammar. The hierarchy is 
reported below, with each item in these scales 
been less marked than the elements to its right: 
 
Animacy Markedness Hierarchy 
Subj/Human > Subj/Animate > Subj/Inanimate 
Obj/Inanimate > Obj/Animate > Obj/Human 
 
Markedness hierarchies have also been 
interpreted as probabilistic constraints estimated 
from corpus data (Bresnan et al 2001). In our 
MaxEnt model we have used a reduced version 
of the animacy markedness hierarchy in which 
human and animate nouns have been both 
subsumed under the general class animate. 
 
Definiteness tests the degree of ?referentiality? of 
the noun in a context pair ?. Like for animacy, 
definiteness has been claimed to be associated 
with grammatical functions, giving rise to the 
following universal markedness hierarchy Aissen 
(2003): 
 
Definiteness Markedness Hierarchy 
Subj/Pro > Subj/Name > Subj/Def > Subj/Indef 
Obj/Indef > Obj/Def > Obj/Name > Obj/Pro 
 
According to this hierarchy, subjects with a low 
degree of definiteness are more marked than 
subjects with a high degree of definiteness (for 
objects the reverse pattern holds). Given the 
importance assigned to the definiteness 
markedness hierarchy in current linguistic 
research, we have included the definiteness cue 
in the MaxEnt model. In our experiments, for 
Italian we have used a compact version of the 
definiteness scale: the definiteness cue tests 
whether the noun in the context pair i) is a name 
or a pronoun ii) has a definite article iii), has an 
indefinite article or iv) is a bare noun (i.e. with 
no article). It is worth saying that bare nouns are 
usually placed at the bottom end of the 
definiteness scale. Since in Czech there is no 
article, we only make a distinction between 
proper names and common nouns. 
5 Testing the model 
The Italian MaxEnt model was trained on 14,643 
verb-subject/object pairs extracted from ISST. 
For Czech, we used a training corpus of 37,947 
verb-subject/object pairs extracted from PDT. In 
both cases, the training set was obtained by 
extracting all verb-subject and verb-object 
dependencies headed by an active verb, with the 
exclusion of all cases where the position of the 
nominal constituent was grammatically 
determined (e.g. clitic objects, relative clauses). 
It is interesting to note that in both training sets 
the proportion of subjects and objects relations is 
nearly the same: 63.06%-65.93% verb-subject 
pairs and 36.94%-34.07% verb-object pairs for 
Italian and Czech respectively. 
The test corpus consists of a set of verb-noun 
pairs randomly extracted from the reference 
Treebanks: 1,000 pairs for Italian and 1,373 for 
Czech. For Italian, 559 pairs contained a subject 
and 441 contained an object; for Czech, 905 
pairs contained a subject and 468 an object. 
Evaluation was carried out by calculating the 
percentage of  correctly  assigned  relations  over 
the total number of test pairs (accuracy). As our 
model always assigns one syntactic relation to 
each test pair, accuracy equals both standard 
precision and recall.

Table 4 - Feature value weights in NLC for Czech and 
Italian
We have assumed a baseline score of 56% for 
Italian and of 66% for Czech, corresponding to 
the result yielded by a naive model   assigning   
to  each   test   pair  the   most frequent relation 
in the training corpus, i.e. subject. Experiments 
were carried out with the general features 
illustrated in section 4: verb agreement, case (for 
Czech only), word order, noun animacy and 
noun definiteness. 
Accuracy on the test corpus is 88.4% for 
Italian and 85.4% for Czech. A detailed error 
analysis for the two languages is reported in 
Table 3, showing that in both languages subject 
identification appears to be particularly 
problematic. In Czech, it appears that the 
prototypically mistaken subjects are post-verbal 
(71.14%), inanimate (72.64%), ambiguously 
case-marked (70.65%) and agreeing with the 
verb (70.15%), where reported percentages refer 
to the whole error set. Likewise, Italian mistaken 
subjects can be described thus: they typically 
occur in post-verbal position (71.55%), are 
mostly inanimate (64.66%) and agree with the 
verb (61.21%). Interestingly, in both languages, 
the highest number of errors occurs when a) N 
has the least prototypical syntactic and semantic 
properties for O or S (relative to word order and 
noun animacy) and b) morpho-syntactic features 
such as agreement and case are neutralised. This 
shows that MaxEnt is able to home in on the core 
linguistic properties that govern the distribution 
of S and O in Italian and Czech, while remaining 
uncertain in the face of somewhat peripheral and 
occasional cases. 
A further way to evaluate the goodness of fit 
of our model is by inspecting the weights 
associated with feature values for the two 
languages. They are reported in Table 4, where 
grey cells highlight the preference of each 
feature value for either subject or object 
identification. In both languages agreement with 
the verb strongly relates to the subject relation. 
For Czech, nominative case is strongly 
associated with subjects while the other cases 
with objects. Moreover, in both languages 
preverbal subjects are strongly preferred over 
preverbal objects; animate subjects are preferred 
over animate objects; pronouns and proper 
names are typically subjects.  
Let us now try to relate these feature values to 
the Markedness Hierarchies reported in section 
4. Interestingly enough, if we rank the Italian 
Anim and Inanim values for subjects and objects, 
we observe that they distribute consistently with 
the Animacy Markedness Hierarchy: Subj/Anim 
> Subj/Inanim and Obj/Inanim > Obj/Anim. This 
is confirmed by the Czech results. Similarly, by 
ranking the Italian values for the definiteness 
features in the Subj column by decreasing weight 
values we obtain the following ordering: 
PronName > DefArt > IndefArt > NoArt, which 
nicely fits in with the Definiteness Markedness 
Hierarchy in section 4. The so-called 
?markedness reversal? is replicated with a good 
degree of approximation, if we focus on the 
values for the same features in the Obj column: 
the PronName feature represents the most 
marked option, followed by IndefArt, DefArt and 
NoArt (the latter two showing the same feature 
value). The exception here is represented by the 
relative ordering of IndefArt and DefArt which 
however show very close values. The same 
26
seems to hold for Czech, where the feature 
ordering for Subj is PronName > 
DefArt/IndefArt/NoArt and the reverse is 
observed for Obj.  
5.1 Evaluating comparative feature salience 
The relative salience of the different constraints 
acting on SOI can be inferred by comparing the 
weights associated with individual feature 
values. For instance, Goldwater and Johnson 
(2003) show that MaxEnt can successfully be 
applied to learn constraint rankings in Optimality 
Theory, by assuming the parameter weights <?1, 
?, ?k> as the ranking values of the constraints.  
Table 5 illustrates the constraint ranking for 
the two languages, ordered by decreasing weight 
values for both S and O. Note that, although not 
all constraints are applicable in both languages, 
the weights associated with applicable 
constraints exhibit the same relative salience in 
Czech and Italian. This seems to suggest the 
existence of a rather dominant (if not universal) 
salience scale of S and O processing constraints, 
in spite of the considerable difference in the 
marking strategies adopted by the two languages. 
As the relative weight of each constraint 
crucially depends on its overall interaction with 
other constraints on a given processing task, 
absolute weight values can considerably vary 
from language to language, with a resulting 
impact on the distribution of S and O 
constructions. For example, the possibility of 
overtly and unambiguously marking a direct 
object with case inflection makes wider room for 
preverbal use of objects in Czech. Conversely, 
lack of case marking in Italian considerably 
limits the preverbal distribution of direct objects.   
This evidence, however, appears to be an 
epiphenomenon of the interaction of fairly stable 
and invariant preferences, reflecting common 
functional tendencies in language processing. As 
shown in Table 5, if constraint ranking largely 
confirms the interplay between animacy and 
word order in Italian, Czech does not contradict 
it but rather re-modulate it somewhat, due to the 
?perturbation? factors introduced by its richer 
battery of case markers. 
6 Conclusions 
Probabilistic language models, machine language 
learning algorithms and linguistic theorizing all 
appear to support a view of language processing 
as a process of dynamic, on-line resolution of 
conflicting grammatical constraints. We begin to 
gain considerable insights into the complex 
process of bootstrapping nature and behaviour of 
these constraints upon observing their actual 
distribution in perceptually salient contexts. In 
our view of things, this trend outlines a 
promising framework providing fresh support to 
usage-based models of language acquisition 
through mathematical and computational 
simulations. Moreover, it allows scholars to 
investigate patterns of cross-linguistic 
typological variation that crucially depend on the 
appropriate setting of model parameters. Finally, 
it promises to solve, on a principled basis, 
traditional performance-oriented cruces of 
grammar theorizing such as degrees of human 
acceptability of ill-formed grammatical 
constructions (Hayes 2000) and the inherently 
graded compositionality of linguistic 
constructions such as morpheme-based words 
and word-based phrases (Bybee 2002, Hay and 
Baayen 2005).  
We argue that the current availability of 
comparable, richly annotated corpora and of 
mathematical tools and models for corpus 
exploration make time ripe for probing the space 
of grammatical variation, both intra- and inter-
linguistically, on unprecedented levels of 
sophistication and granularity. All in all, we 
anticipate that such a convergence is likely to 
have a twofold impact: it is bound to shed light 
on the integration of performance and 
competence factors in language study; it will 
make mathematical models of language 
increasingly able to accommodate richer and 
richer language evidence, thus putting 
explanatory theoretical accounts to the test of a 
usage-based empirical verification. 
In the near future, we intend to pursue two 
parallel lines of development. First we would 
like to increase the context-sensitiveness of our 
processing task by integrating binary 
grammatical constraints into the broader context 
of multiply conflicting grammar relations. This 
way, we will be in a position to capture the 
constraint that a (transitive) verb has at most one 
subject and one object, thus avoiding multiple 
assignment of subject (object) relations in the 
same context. Suppose, for example, that both 
nouns in a noun-noun-verb triple are amenable to 
a subject interpretation, but that one of them is a 
more likely subject than the other. Then, it is 
reasonable to expect the model to process the 
less likely subject candidate as the object of the 
verb in the triple. Another promising line of 
development is based on the observation that the 
27
order in which verb arguments appear in context 
is also lexically governed: in Italian, for 
example, report verbs show a strong tendency to 
select subjects post-verbally. Dell?Orletta et al 
(2005) report a substantial improvement on the 
model performance on Italian SOI when lexical 
information is taken into account, as a lexicalized 
MaxEnt model appears to integrate general 
constructional and semantic biases with 
lexically-specific preferences. In a cross-lingual 
perspective, comparable evidence of lexical 
constraints on word order would allow us to 
discover language-wide invariants in the lexicon-
grammar interplay.

Abstract 
We describe our experiments using the 
DeSR parser in the multilingual and do-
main adaptation tracks of the CoNLL 2007 
shared task. DeSR implements an incre-
mental deterministic Shift/Reduce parsing 
algorithm, using specific rules to handle 
non-projective dependencies. For the multi-
lingual track we adopted a second order 
averaged perceptron and performed feature 
selection to tune a feature model for each 
language. For the domain adaptation track 
we applied a tree revision method which 
learns how to correct the mistakes made by 
the base parser on the adaptation domain. 
1 Introduction 
Classifier-based dependency parsers (Yamada and 
Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004) learn 
from an annotated corpus how to select an 
appropriate sequence of Shift/Reduce actions to 
construct the dependency tree for a sentence. 
Learning is based on techniques such as SVM 
(Vapnik 1998) or Memory Based Learning 
(Daelemans 2003), which provide high accuracy 
but are often computationally expensive. For the 
multilingual track in the CoNLL 2007 Shared 
Task, we employed a Shift/Reduce parser which 
uses a perceptron algorithm with second-order 
feature maps, in order to verify whether a simpler 
and faster algorithm can still achieve comparable 
accuracy. 
For the domain adaptation track we wished to 
explore the use of tree revisions in order to 
incorporate language knowledge from a new 
domain. 
2 Multilingual Track 
The overall parsing algorithm is a deterministic 
classifier-based statistical parser, which extends 
the approach by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), 
by using different reduction rules that ensure 
deterministic incremental processing of the input 
sentence and by adding specific rules for handling 
non-projective dependencies. The parser also 
performs dependency labeling within a single 
processing step. 
The parser is modular and can use several 
learning algorithms. The submitted runs used a 
second order Average Perceptron, derived from the 
multiclass perceptron of Crammer and Singer 
(2003). 
No additional resources were used. No pre-
processing or post-processing was used, except 
stemming for English, by means of the Snowball 
stemmer (Porter 2001). 
3 Deterministic Classifier-based Parsing 
DeSR (Attardi, 2006) is an incremental determinis-
tic classifier-based parser. The parser constructs 
dependency trees employing a deterministic bot-
tom-up algorithm which performs Shift/Reduce 
actions while analyzing input sentences in left-to-
right order. 
Using a notation similar to (Nivre and Scholz, 
2003), the state of the parser is represented by a 
1112
quadruple ?S, I, T, A?, where S is the stack of past 
tokens, I is the list of (remaining) input tokens, T is 
a stack of temporary tokens and A is the arc rela-
tion for the dependency graph. 
Given an input string W, the parser is initialized 
to ?(), W, (), ()?, and terminates when it reaches a 
configuration ?S, (), (), A?. 
The three basic parsing rule schemas are as fol-
lows: ?S, n|I, T, A? Shift ?n|S, I, T, A? ?s|S, n|I, T, A? Rightd ?S, n|I, T, A?{(s, d, n)}? ?s|S, n|I, T, A? Leftd ?S, s|I, T, A?{(n, d, s)}? 
The schemas for the Left and Right rules are in-
stantiated for each dependency type d ? D, for a 
total of 2|D| + 1 rules. These rules perform both 
attachment and labeling. 
At each step the parser uses classifiers trained 
on a treebank corpus in order to predict which ac-
tion to perform and which dependency label to as-
sign given the current configuration. 
4 Non-Projective Relations 
For handling non-projective relations, Nivre and 
Nilsson (2005) suggested applying a pre-
processing step to a dependency parser, which con-
sists in lifting non-projective arcs to their head re-
peatedly, until the tree becomes pseudo-projective. 
A post-processing step is then required to restore 
the arcs to the proper heads. 
In DeSR non-projective dependencies are han-
dled in a single step by means of the following ad-
ditional parsing rules, slightly different from those 
in (Attardi, 2006): 
 ?s1|s2|S, n|I, T, A? Right2d ? S, s1|n|I, T, A?{(s2, d, n)}? ?s1|s2|S, n|I, T, A? Left2d ?s2|S, s1|I, T, A?{(n, d, s2)}? ?s1|s2|s3|S, n|I, T, A? Right3d ? S, s1|s2|n|I, T, A?{(s3, d, n)}? ?s1|s2|s3|S, n|I, T, A? Left3d ?s2|s3|S, s1|I, T, A?{(n, d, s3)}? 
 ?s1|s2|S, n|I, T, A? Extract ?n|s1|S, I, s2|T, A? ?S, I, s1|T, A? Insert ?s1|S, I, T, A? 
Left2, Right2 are similar to Left and Right, except 
that they create links crossing one intermediate 
node, while Left3 and Right3 cross two intermedi-
ate nodes. Notice that the RightX actions put back 
on the input the intervening tokens, allowing the 
parser to complete the linking of tokens whose 
processing had been delayed. Extract/Insert gener-
alize the previous rules by moving one token to the 
stack T and reinserting the top of T into S. 
5 Perceptron Learning and 2nd-Order 
Feature Maps 
The software architecture of the DeSR parser is 
modular. Several learning algorithms are available, 
including SVM, Maximum Entropy, Memory-
Based Learning, Logistic Regression and a few 
variants of the perceptron algorithm. 
We obtained the best accuracy with a multiclass 
averaged perceptron classifier based on the 
ultraconservative formulation of Crammer and 
Singer (2003) with uniform negative updates. The 
classifier function is: { }xxF k
k
?= ?maxarg)(  
where each parsing action k is associated with a 
weight vector ?k. To regularize the model the final 
weight vectors are computed as the average of all 
weight vectors posited during training. The number 
of learning iterations over the training data, which 
is the only adjustable parameter of the algorithm, 
was determined by cross-validation.  
In order to overcome the limitations of a linear 
perceptron, we introduce a feature map ?: IRd ? 
IRd(d+1)/2 that maps a feature vector x into a higher 
dimensional feature space consisting of all un-
ordered feature pairs: ?(x) = ?xixj | i = 1, ?, d, j = i, ?, d? 
In other words we expand the original 
representation in the input space with a feature 
map that generates all second-order feature 
combinations from each observation. We call this 
the 2nd-order model, where the inner products are 
computed as ?k ? ?(x), with ?k a vector of dimen-
sion d(d+1)/2. Applying a linear perceptron to this 
feature space corresponds to simulating a polyno-
mial kernel of degree two.  
A polynomial kernel of degree two for SVM 
was also used by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003). 
However, training SVMs on large data sets like 
those arising from a big training corpus was too 
1113
computationally expensive, forcing them to resort 
to partitioning the training data (by POS) and to 
learn several models. 
Our implementation of the perceptron algorithm 
uses sparse data structures (hash maps) so that it 
can handle efficiently even large feature spaces in 
a single model. For example the feature space for 
the 2nd-order model for English contains over 21 
million. Parsing unseen data can be performed at 
tens of sentences per second. More details on such 
aspects of the DeSR parser can be found in (Ci-
aramita and Attardi 2007). 
6 Tuning 
The base parser was tuned on several parameters to 
optimize its accuracy as follows. 
6.1 Feature Selection 
Given the different characteristics of languages and 
corpus annotations, it is worth while to select a 
different set of features for each language. For ex-
ample, certain corpora do not contain lemmas or 
morphological information so lexical information 
will be useful. Vice versa, when lemmas are pre-
sent, lexical information might be avoided, reduc-
ing the size of the feature set. 
We performed a series of feature selection ex-
periments on each language, starting from a fairly 
comprehensive set of 43 features and trying all 
variants obtained by dropping a single feature. The 
best of these alternatives feature models was cho-
sen and the process iterated until no further gains 
were achieved. The score for the alternatives was 
computed on a development set of approximately 
5000 tokens, extracted from a split of the original 
training corpus. 
Despite the process is not guaranteed to produce 
a global optimum, we noticed LAS improvements 
of up to 4 percentage points on some languages. 
The set of features to be used by DeSR is con-
trolled by a number of parameters supplied through 
a parameter file. Each parameter describes a fea-
ture and from which tokens to extract it. Tokens 
are referred through positive numbers for input 
tokens and negative numbers for tokens on the 
stack. For example 
PosFeatures -2 -1 0 1 2 3 
means to use the POS tag of the first two tokens on 
the stack and of the first four tokens on the input. 
The parameter PosPrev refers to the POS of the 
preceding token in the original sentence, PosLeftChild refers to the POS of the left chil-
dren of a token, PastActions tells how many 
previous actions to include as features. 
The selection process was started from the fol-
lowing base feature model: 
LexFeatures -1 0 1 LemmaFeatures -2 -1 0 1 2 3 LemmaPrev  -1 0 LemmaSucc  -1 0 LemmaLeftChild -1 0 LemmaRightChild -1 MorphoFeatures -1 0 1 2 PosFeatures -2 -1 0 1 2 3 PosNext  -1 0 PosPrev  -1 0 PosLeftChild -1 0 PosRightChild -1 0 CPosFeatures -1 0 1 DepFeatures -1 0 DepLeftChild -1 0 DepRightChild -1 PastActions 1 
The selection process produced different variants 
for each language, sometimes suggesting dropping 
certain intermediate features, like the lemma of the 
third next input token in the case of Catalan: 
LemmaFeatures -2 -1 0 1 3 LemmaPrev  0 LemmaSucc  -1 LemmaLeftChild 0 LemmaRightChild -1 PosFeatures -2 -1 0 1 2 3 PosPrev  0 PosSucc  -1 PosLeftChild -1 0 PosRightChild -1 0 CPosFeatures -1 0 1 MorphoFeatures 0 1 DepLeftChild -1 0 DepRightChild -1 
For Italian, instead, we ran a series of tests in par-
allel using a set of manually prepared feature mod-
els. The best of these models achieved a LAS of 
80.95%. The final run used this model with the 
addition of the morphological agreement feature 
discussed below. 
 
English was the only language for which no feature 
selection was done and for which lexical features 
1114
were used. English is also the language where the 
official score is significantly lower than what we 
had been getting on our development set (90.01% 
UAS). 
6.2 Prepositional Attachment 
Certain languages, such as Catalan, use detailed 
dependency labeling, that for instance distinguish 
between adverbials of location and time. We ex-
ploited this information by introducing a feature 
that captures the entity type of a child of the top 
word on the stack or in the input. During training a 
list of nouns occurring in the corpus as dependent 
on prepositions with label CCL (meaning ?com-
plement of location? for Catalan) was created and 
similarly for CCT (complement of time). The en-
tity type TIME is extracted as a feature depending 
on whether the noun occurs in the time list more 
than ? times than in the location list, and similarly 
for the feature LOCATION. ? was set to 1.5 in our 
experiments. 
6.3 Morphological Agreement 
Certain languages require gender and number 
agreement between head and dependent. The fea-
ture MorphoAgreement is computed for such lan-
guages and provided noticeable accuracy 
improvements. 
For example, for Italian, the improvement was 
from: 
  LAS: 80.95%,  UAS: 85.03% 
to: 
  LAS: 81.34%,  UAS: 85.54% 
For Catalan, adding this feature we obtained an 
unofficial score of: 
  LAS: 87.64%,  UAS: 92.20% 
with respect to the official run: 
  LAS: 86.86%,  UAS: 91.41% 
7 Accuracy 
Table 1 reports the accuracy scores in the multilin-
gual track. They are all considerably above the 
average and within 2% from the best for Catalan, 
3% for Chinese, Greek, Italian and Turkish. 
8 Performance 
The experiments were performed on a 2.4 Ghz 
AMD Opteron machine with 32 GB RAM. Train-
ing the parser using the 2nd-order perceptron on the 
English corpus required less than 3 GB of memory 
and about one hour for each iteration over the 
whole dataset. Parsing the English test set required 
39.97 sec. For comparison, we tested the MST 
parser version 0.4.3 (Mstparser, 2007), configured 
for second-order, on the same data: training took 
73.9 minutes to perform 10 iterations and parsing 
took 97.5 sec. MST parser achieved: 
LAS: 89.01%, UAS: 90.17% 
9 Error Analysis on Catalan 
The parser achieved its best score on Catalan, so 
we performed an analysis on its output for this lan-
guage. 
Among the 42 dependency relations that the 
parser had to assign to a sentence, the largest num-
ber of errors occurred assigning CC (124), SP (33), CD (27), SUJ (26), CONJUNCT (22), SN (23). 
The submitted run for Catalan did not use the 
entity feature discussed earlier and indeed 67 er-
rors were due to assigning CCT or CCL instead of 
CC (generic complement of circumstance). How-
ever over half of these appear as underspecified 
annotation errors in the corpus rather than parser 
errors. 
By adding the ChildEntityType feature, 
which distinguishes better between CCT and CCL, 
the UAS improved, while the LAS dropped 
slightly, due to the effect of underspecified annota-
tions in the corpus: 
   LAS: 87.22%,    UAS: 91.71%

A peculiar aspect of the original Catalan corpus 
was the use of a large number (195) of dependency 
labels. These labels were reduced to 42 in the ver-
sion used for CoNNL 2007, in order to make it 
comparable to other corpora. However, performing 
some preliminary experiments using the original 
Catalan collection with all 195 dependency labels, 
the DeSR parser achieved a significantly better 
score: 
LAS: 88.80%, UAS: 91.43% 
while with the modified one, the score dropped to: 
LAS: 84.55%, UAS: 89.38% 
This suggests that accuracy might improve for 
other languages as well if the training corpus was 
labeled with more precise dependencies. 
10 Adaptation Track 
The adaptation track originally covered two do-
mains, the CHILDES and the Chemistry domain.  
The CHILDES (Brown, 1973; MacWhinney, 
2000) consists of transcriptions of dialogues with 
children, typically short sentences of the kind: 
Would you like more grape juice ? 
That 's a nice box of books . 
Phrases are short, half of them are questions. The 
only difficulty that appeared from looking at the 
unlabeled collection supplied for training in the 
domain was the presence of truncated terms like goin (for going), d (for did), etc. However none 
of these unusually spelled words appeared in the 
test set, so a normal English parser performed rea-
sonably well on this task. Because of certain in-
consistencies in the annotation guidelines, the 
organizers decided to make this task optional and 
hence we submitted just the parse produced by the 
parser trained for English. 
For the second adaptation task we were given a 
large collection of unlabeled data in the chemistry 
domain (Kulick et al 2004) as well as a test set of 
5000 tokens (200 sentences) to parse (eng-lish_pchemtbtb_test.conll). 
There were three sets of unlabeled documents: 
we chose the smallest (unlab1) consisting of over 
300,000 tokens (11663 sentences). unlab1 was 
tokenized, POS and lemmas were added using our 
version of TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), and lem-
mas replaced with stems, which had turned out to 
be more effective than lemmas. We call this set pchemtb_unlab1.conll. 
We trained the DeSR parser on English using english_ptb_train.conll, the WSJ PTB col-
lection provided for CoNLL 2007. This consists of 
WSJ sections 02-11, half of the usual set 02-23, for 
a total of 460,000 tokens with dependencies gener-
ated with the converter by Johansson and Nugues 
(2007). 
We added stems and produced a parser called DeSRwsj. By parsing eng-lish_pchem_test.conll with DeSRwsj we 
obtained pchemtb_test_base.desr, our base-
line for the task. 
By visual inspection using DgAnnotator 
(DgAnnotator, 2006), the parses looked generally 
correct. Most of the errors seemed due to improper 
handling of conjunctions and disjunctions. The 
collection in fact contains several phrases like: 
Specific antibodies raised against 
P450IIB1 , P450 IA1 or IA2 , 
P450IIE1 , and P450IIIA2 inhibited 
the activation in liver microsomes 
from rats pretreated with PB , BNF , 
INH and DEX respectively 
The parser did not seem to have much of a problem 
with terminology, possibly because the supplied 
gold POS were adequate. 
For the adaptation we proceeded as follows. We 
parsed pchemtb_unlab1.conll using DeSRwsj 
obtaining pchemtb_unlab1.desr. 
We then extracted a set of 12,500 sentences 
from ptb_train.conll and 7,500 sentences 
from pchemtb_unlab1.desr, creating a corpus 
of 20,000 sentences called combined.conll. In 
both cases the selection criteria was to choose sen-
tences shorter than 30 tokens. 
We then trained a low accuracy parser (called DesrCombined) on combined.conll, by using 
a 1st-order averaged perceptron. DesrCombined 
was used to parse english_ptb_train.conll, 
the original training corpus for English. By com-
paring this parse with the original, one can detect 
where such parser makes mistakes. The rationale 
for using an inaccurate parser is to obtain parses 
with many errors so that they form a suitably large 
training set for the next step: parser revision. 
We then used a parsing revision technique (At-
tardi and Ciaramita, 2007) to learn how to correct 
these errors, producing a parse reviser called DesrReviser. The revision technique consists of 
comparing the parse trees produced by the parser 
with the gold standard parse trees, from the 
annotated corpus. Where a difference is noted, a 
1116
revision rule is determined to correct the mistake. 
Such rules consist in movements of a single link to 
a different head. Learning how to revise a parse 
tree consists in training a classifier on a set of 
training examples consisting of pairs ?(wi, d, wj), 
ti?, i.e. the link to be modified and the 
transformation rule to apply. Attardi and Ciaramita 
(2007) showed that 80% of the corrections can be 
typically dealt with just 20 tree revision rules. For 
the adaptation track we limited the training to 
errors recurring at least 20 times and to 30 rules. DesrReviser was then applied to pchemtb_test_base.desr producing pchemtb_test_rev.desr, our final submission. 
Many conjunction errors were corrected, in par-
ticular by moving the head of the sentence from a 
coordinate verb to the conjunction ?and? linking 
two coordinate phrases. 
The revision step produced an improvement of 
0.42% LAS over the score achieved by using just 
the base DeSRwsj parser. 
Table 2 reports the official accuracy scores on 
the closed adaptation track. DeSR achieved a close 
second best UAS on the ptchemtb test set and 
third best on CHILDES. The results are quite en-
couraging, particularly considering that the revi-
sion step does not yet correct the dependency 
labels and that our base English parser had a lower 
rank in the multilingual track.

Table 2. Closed adaptation track scores. 
Notice that the adaptation process could be iter-
ated. Since the combination DeSRwsj+DesrReviser is a more accurate parser 
than DeSRwsj, we could use it again to parse pchemtb_unlab1.conll and so on. 
11 Conclusions 
For performing multilingual parsing in the CoNLL 
2007 shared task we employed DeSR, a classifier-
based Shift/Reduce parser. We used a second order 
averaged perceptron as classifier and achieved ac-
curacy scores quite above the average in all lan-
guages. For proper comparison with other 
approaches, one should take into account that the 
parser is incremental and deterministic; hence it is 
typically faster than other non linear algorithms. 
For the adaptation track we used a novel ap-
proach, based on the technique of tree revision, 
applied to a parser trained on a corpus combining 
sentences from both the training and the adaptation 
domain. The technique achieved quite promising 
results and it also offers the interesting possibility 
of being iterated, allowing the parser to incorporate 
language knowledge from additional domains. 
Since the technique is applicable to any parser, 
we plan to test it also with more accurate English 
parsers.

Abstract
This paper describes the DeSRL sys-
tem, a joined effort of Yahoo! Research
Barcelona and Universit`a di Pisa for the
CoNLL-2008 Shared Task (Surdeanu et
al., 2008). The system is characterized by
an efficient pipeline of linear complexity
components, each carrying out a different
sub-task. Classifier errors and ambigui-
ties are addressed with several strategies:
revision models, voting, and reranking.
The system participated in the closed chal-
lenge ranking third in the complete prob-
lem evaluation with the following scores:
82.06 labeled macro F1 for the overall task,
86.6 labeled attachment for syntactic de-
pendencies, and 77.5 labeled F1 for se-
mantic dependencies.
1 System description
DeSRL is implemented as a sequence of compo-
nents of linear complexity relative to the sentence
length. We decompose the problem into three sub-
tasks: parsing, predicate identification and clas-
sification (PIC), and argument identification and
classification (AIC). We address each of these sub-
tasks with separate components without backward
feedback between sub-tasks. However, the use of
multiple parsers at the beginning of the process,
and re-ranking at the end, contribute beneficial
stochastic aspects to the system. Figure 1 summa-
rizes the system architecture. We detail the parsing

(PIC and AIC) in Section 3.
2 Parsing
In the parsing sub-task we use a combination strat-
egy on top of three individual parsing models,
two developed in-house ?DeSR
left?to?right
and
DeSR
revision
right?to?left
? and a third using an off-the-
shelf parser, Malt 1.0.0
1
.
2.1 DeSR
left?to?right
This model is a version of DeSR (Attardi, 2006),
a deterministic classifier-based Shift/Reduce
parser. The parser processes input tokens advanc-
ing on the input from left to right with Shift ac-
tions and accumulates processed tokens on a stack
with Reduce actions. The parser has been adapted
for this year?s shared task and extended with addi-
tional classifiers, e.g., Multi Layer Perceptron and
multiple SVMs.
2
The parser uses the following features:
1. SPLIT LEMMA: from tokens ?1, 0, 1, prev(0),
leftChild(0), rightChild(0)
2. PPOSS: from ?2, ?1, 0, 1, 2, 3, prev(0), next(?1),
leftChild(?1), leftChild(0), rightChild(?1),
rightChild(0)
3. DEPREL: from leftChild(?1), leftChild(0),
rightChild(?1)
4. HDIST: from ?1, 0
In the above list negative numbers refer to tokens
on the stack, positive numbers to tokens in the in-
put queue. We use the following path operators:
leftChild(x) refers to the leftmost child of token
x, rightChild(x) to the rightmost child of token
x, prev(x) and next(x) respectively to the token
preceding or following x in the sentence.

The first three types of features are directly ex-
tracted from the attributes of tokens present in the
training corpus. The fourth feature represents the
distance of the token to the head of the noun phrase
to which it belongs, or ?O? if it does not belong to
a noun phrase. This distance is computed with a
simple heuristic, based on a pattern of POS tags.
Attardi and Dell?Orletta (2008) have shown that
this feature improves the accuracy of a shift/reduce
dependency parser by providing approximate in-
formation about NP chunks in the sentence. In fact
no token besides the head of a noun phrase can
have a head referring to a token outside the noun
phrase. Hence the parser can learn to avoid creat-
ing such links. The addition of this feature yields
an increase of 0.80% in Labeled Accuracy on the
development set.
2.2 Revision Parser: DeSR
revision
right?to?left
Our second individual parsing model implements
an alternative to the method of revising parse trees
of Attardi and Ciaramita (2007) (see also (Hall &
Novak, 2005)). The original approach consisted in
training a classifier to revise the errors of a base-
line parser. The approach assumed that only lo-
cal revisions to the parse tree would be needed,
since the dependency parser mostly gets individual
phrases correctly. The experiments showed that in-
deed most of the corrections can be expressed by
a small set of (about 20) complex movement rules.
Furthermore, there was evidence that one could get
higher improvements from the tree revision classi-
fier if this was trained on the output of a lower ac-
curacy parser. The reason for this is that the num-
ber of errors is higher and this provides a larger
amount of training data.
For the CoNLL 2008 shared task, we refined this
idea, but instead of using an independent classi-
fier for the revision, we use the parser itself. The
second parser is trained on the original corpus ex-
tended with dependency information predicted by
a lower accuracy parser. To obtain the base parser
we use DeSR trained on half the training corpus
using a Maximum Entropy (ME) classifier. The
ME classifier is considerably faster to train but has
a lower accuracy: this model achieved an LAS of
76.49% on the development set. Using the out-
put of the ME-based parser we extend the original
corpus with four additional columns: the lemma
of the predicted head (PHLEMMA), the PPOSS of
the predicted head (PHPPOSS), the dependency of
the predicted head (PHDEPREL), and the indica-
tion of whether a token appears before or after its
predicted head. A second parser is trained on this
corpus, scanning sentences from right to left and
using the following additional features:
1. PHPPOSS: from ?1, 0
2. PHLEMMA: from ?1, 0
3. PHDEPREL: from ?1, 0
4. PHHDIST: from 0
Performing parsing in reverse order helps reduce
several of the errors that a deterministic parser
makes when dependency links span a long distance
in the input sequence. Experiments on the CoNLL
2007 corpora (Dell?Orletta, 2008) have shown that
this indeed occurs, especially for distances in the
range from 6 to 23. In particular, the most signifi-
cant improvements are for dependencies with label
COORD (+ 6%) and P (+ 8%).
The revision parser achieves an LAS of 85.81%
on the development set. Note that the extra fea-
tures from the forward parser are indeed use-
ful, since a simple backward parser only achieves
82.56% LAS on the development set.
2.3 Parser Combination
The final step consists in combining the out-
puts of the three individual models a simple
voting scheme: for each token we use major-
ity voting to select its head and dependency la-
bel. In case of ties, we chose the dependency
predicted by our overall best individual model
(DeSR
revision
right?to?left
).
3
Note that typical approaches to parser
combination combine the outputs of inde-
pendent parsers, while in our case one base
model (DeSR
revision
right?to?left
) is trained with
3
We tried several voting strategies but none performed bet-
ter.
259
information predicted by another individual
model(DeSR
left?to?right
). To the best of our
knowledge, combining individual parsing models
that are inter-dependent is novel.
3 Semantic Role Labeling
We implement the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
problem using three components: PIC, AIC, and
reranking of predicted argument frames.
3.1 Predicate Identification and Classification
The PIC component carries out the identification
of predicates, as well as their partial disambigua-
tion, and it is implemented as a multiclass average
Perceptron classifier (Crammer & Singer, 2003).
For each token i we extract the following features
(?, ? stands for token combination):
1. SPLIT LEMMA: from ?i?1, i?, i?1, i, i+1, ?i, i+1?
2. SPLIT FORM: from i? 2, i? 1, i, i+ 1.i+ 2
3. PPOSS: from ?i?2, i?1?, ?i?1, i?, i?1, i, i+1, ?i, i+
1?, ?i+ 1, i+ 2?
4. WORD SHAPE: e.g., ?Xx*? for ?Brazil?, from ?i?2, i?
1, i?, ?i? 1, i?, i? 1, i, i+1, ?i, i+1?, ?i, i+1, i+2?
5. Number of children of node i
6. For each children j of i: split lemma
j
, pposs
j
,
deprel
i,j
, ?split lemma
i
, split lemma
j
?, ?pposs
i
,
pposs
j
?
7. Difference of positions: j ? i, for each child j of i.
The PIC component uses one single classifier map-
ping tokens to one of 8 classes corresponding to
the rolesets suffixes 1 to 6, the 6 most frequent
types, plus a class grouping all other rolesets, and
a class for non predicates; i.e., Y = {0, 1, 2, .., 7}.
Each token classified as y
7
is mapped by default to
the first sense y
1
. This approach is capable of dis-
tinguishing between different predicates based on
features 1 and 2, but it can also exploit information
that is shared between predicates due to similar
frame structures. The latter property is intuitively
useful especially for low-frequency predicates.
The classifier has an accuracy in the multiclass
problem, considering also the mistakes due to the
non-predicted classes, of 96.2%, and an F-score of
92.7% with respect to the binary predicate iden-
tification problem. To extract features from trees
(5-7) we use our parser?s output on training, devel-
opment and evaluation data.
3.2 Argument Identification and
Classification
Algorithm 1 describes our AIC framework. The al-
gorithm receives as input a sentence S where pred-
icates have been identified and classified using the
Algorithm 1: AIC
input : sentence S; inference strategy I; model w
foreach predicate p in S do
set frame F
in
= {}
foreach token i in S do
if validCandidate(i) then
?
y = arg max
y?Y
score(?(p, i),w, y)
if
?
y 6= nil then
add argument (i,
?
y) to F
in
F
out
= inference(F
in
, I)
output: set of all frames F
out
PIC component, an inference strategy I is used
to guarantee that the generated best frames satisfy
the domain constraints, plus an AIC classification
model w. We learn w using a multiclass Percep-
tron, using as output label setY all argument labels
that appear more than 10 times in training plus a nil
label assigned to all other tokens.
During both training and evaluation we se-
lect only the candidate tokens that pass the
validCandidate filter. This function requires that
the length of the dependency path between pred-
icate and candidate argument be less than 6, the
length of the dependency path between argument
and the first common ancestor be less than 3, and
the length of the dependency path between the
predicate and the first common ancestor be less
than 5. This heuristic covers over 98% of the ar-
guments in training.
In the worst case, Algorithm 1 has quadratic
complexity in the sentence size. But, on average,
the algorithm has linear time complexity because
the number of predicates per sentence is small (av-
eraging less than five for sentences of 25 words).
The function ? generates the feature vector for
a given predicate-argument tuple. ? extracts the
following features from a given tuple of a predicate
p and argument a:
1. token(a)
4
, token(modifier of a) if a is the
head of a prepositional phrase, and token(p).
2. Patterns of PPOSS tags and DEPREL labels
for: (a) the predicate children, (b) the children
of the predicate ancestor across VC and IM
dependencies, and (c) the siblings of the same
ancestor. In all paths we mark the position of
p, a and any of their ancestors.
3. The dependency path between p and a. We
add three versions of this feature: just the

tag of a given token.
260
path, and the path prefixed with p and a?s
PPOSS tags or split lemmas.
4. Length of the dependency path.
5. Distance in tokens between p and a.
6. Position of a relative to p: before or after.
We implemented two inference strategies:
greedy and reranking. The greedy strategy sorts
all arguments in a frame F
in
in descending order
of their scores and iteratively adds each argument
to the output frame F
out
only if it respects the do-
main constraints with the other arguments already
selected. The only domain constraint we use is that
core arguments cannot repeat.
3.3 Reranking of Argument Frames
The reranking inference strategy adapts the ap-
proach of Toutanova et al (2005) to the depen-
dency representation with notable changes in can-
didate selection, feature set, and learning model.
For candidate selection we modify Algorithm 1:
instead of storing only y? for each argument in F
in
we store the top k best labels. Then, from the ar-
guments in F
in
, we generate the top k frames with
the highest score, where the score of a frame is the
product of all its argument probabilities, computed
as the softmax function on the output of the Per-
ceptron. In this set of candidate frames we mark
the frame with the highest F
1
score as the positive
example and all others as negative examples.
From each frame we extract these features:
1. Position of the frame in the set ordered by
frame scores. Hence, smaller positions in-
dicate candidate frames that the local model
considered better (Marquez et al, 2007).
2. The complete sequence of arguments and
predicate for this frame (Toutanova, 2005).
We add four variants of this feature: just the
sequence and sequence expanded with: (a)
predicate voice, (b) predicate split lemma,
and (c) combination of voice and split lemma.
3. The complete sequence of arguments and
predicate for this frame combined with their
PPOSS tags. Same as above, we add four
variants of this feature.
4. Overlap with the PropBank or NomBank
frame for the same predicate lemma and
sense. We add the precision, recall, and F
1
score of the overlap as features (Marquez et
al., 2007).
5. For each frame argument, we add the features
from the local AIC model prefixed with the

frame (Toutanova, 2005).
The reranking classifier is implemented as multi-
layer perceptron with one hidden layer of 5 units,
trained to solve a regression problem with a least
square criterion function. Previously we experi-
mented, unsuccessfully, with a multiclass Percep-
tron and a ranking Perceptron. The limited number
of hidden units guarantees a small computational
overhead with respect to a linear model.
4 Results and Analysis
Table 1 shows the overall results of our system
in the closed challenge. Note that these scores
are higher than those of our submitted run mainly
due to improved parsing models (discussed be-
low) whose training ended after the deadline. The
score of the submitted system is the third best
for the complete task. The system throughput in
our best configuration is 28 words/second, or 30
words/second without reranking. In exploratory
experiments on feature selection for the re-ranking
model we found that several features classes do
not contribute anything and could be filtered out
speeding up significantly this last SRL step. Note
however that currently over 90% of the runtime is
occupied by the syntactic parsers? SVM classifiers.
We estimate that we can increase throughput one
order of magnitude simply by switching to a faster,
multiclass classifier in parsing.
4.1 Analysis of Parsing
Table 2 lists the labeled attachment scores (LAS)
achieved by each parser and by their combination
on the development set, the WSJ and Brown test
sets. The results are improved with respect to the

mentioned earlier. These results show that vot-
ing helps significantly (+1.56% over the best single
parser) even though inter-dependent models were
used. However, our simple voting scheme does
not guarantee that a well-formed tree is generated,
leaving room for further improvements; e.g., as
in (Sagae & Lavie, 2006).
4.2 Analysis of SRL
Table 3 shows the labeled and unlabeled F
1
scores
of our SRL component as we move from gold to
predicted information for syntax and PIC. For the
shared task setting ?predicted syntax and predicted
PIC? we show results for the two inference strate-
gies implemented: greedy and reranking. The first
line in the table indicates that the performance of
the SRL component when using gold syntax and
gold PIC is good: the labeled F
1
is 90 points for the
in-domain corpus and approximately 85 points for
the out-of-domain corpus. Argument classification
suffers the most on out-of-domain input: there is
a difference of 5 points between the labeled scores
on WSJ and Brown, even though the correspond-
ing unlabeled scores are comparable.
The second line in the table replicates the setup
of the 2005 CoNLL shared task: predicted syntax
but gold PIC. This yields a moderate drop of 3 la-
beled F
1
points on in-domain data and a larger drop
of 6 points for out-of-domain data.
We see larger drops when switching to predicted
PIC (line 3): 5-6 labeled F
1
points in domain and
12 points out of domain. This drop is caused by the
PIC component, e.g., if a predicate is missed the
whole frame is lost. Table 4 lists the scores of our
PIC component, which we compare with a base-
line system that assigns sense 1 to all identified
predicates. The table indicates that, even though
our disambiguation component improves signifi-
cantly over the baseline, it performs poorly, espe-
cially on out-of-domain data. Same as SRL, the
classification sub-task suffers the most out of do-
main (there is a difference of 15 points between
unlabeled and labeled F
1
scores on Brown).
Finally, the reranking inference strategy yields
only modest improvements (last line in Table 3).
We attribute these results to the fact that, unlike
Toutanova et al (2005), we use only one tree to
generate frame candidates, hence the variation in
the candidate frames is small. Considering that the
processing overhead of reranking is already large
(it quadruples the runtime of our AIC component),
we do not consider reranking a practical extension
to a SRL system when processing speed is a dom-
inant requirement.

Abstract
In this paper we tackle the challenging
task of Multi-word term (MWT) extrac-
tion from different types of specialized
corpora. Contrastive filtering of previ-
ously extracted MWTs results in a con-
siderable increment of acquired domain-
specific terms.
1 Introduction
Multi-word term (MWT) extraction is a challeng-
ing and well-known automatic term recognition
(ATR) subtask, aimed at retrieving complex do-
main terminology from specialized corpora. Al-
though domain sublanguages are characterized by
specific vocabularies, a well-defined border be-
tween specific sublanguages (SLs) and general
language (GL) vocabularies is difficult to establish
since lexicon shifts in a continuum from a highly
specialized area to a transition area between GL
and SLs (Rondeau et al, 1984). Within this con-
tinuum, Cabre? (1999) identifies three types of lex-
ical items: a. GL lexical items; b. SL terms, c.
lexical items belonging to a borderline area be-
tween GL and SL. The proportion of these dif-
ferent types of lexical items varies depending on
the text type. To our knowledge, automatic term
recognition methods proposed so far in the litera-
ture focussed on highly specialized corpora (typ-
ically, technical and scientific literature), mainly
characterized by SL terminology. However, the
same ATR methods may not be equally effective
when dealing with corpora characterized by a dif-
ferent proportion of term types; e.g. from texts
such as Wikipedia articles, which are conceived
for a more extended audience, both SL terms and
common words are acquired as long as they show
a statistically significant distribution. In this pa-
per, we claim that the contrastive approach to
MWT extraction described in Bonin et al (2010)
can be effectively exploited to distinguish be-
tween common words and domain-specific termi-
nology in different types of corpora as well as to
identify terms belonging to different SLs when oc-
curring in the same text. The latter is the case of
legal texts, characterized by a mixture of differ-
ent SLs, the legal and the regulated-domain SLs
(Breuker et al, 2004). Effectiveness and flexibil-
ity of the proposed ATR approach has been tested
with different experiments aimed at the extrac-
tion of domain terminology from corpora charac-
terized by different degrees of difficulty as far as
ATR is concerned, namely (i) environmental sci-
entific literature, (ii) Wikipedia environmental ar-
ticles, and (iii) a corpus of legal texts on environ-
mental domain.
2 General Extraction Method
The MWT extraction methodology we follow is
organized in two steps, described in detail in
Bonin et al (2010). Firstly, a shortlist of well-
formed and relevant candidate MWTs is extracted
from a given target corpus and secondly a con-
trastive method is applied against the selected
MWTs only. In fact, in the first stage, candi-
date MWTs are searched for in an automatically
POS-tagged and lemmatized text and they are then
weighted with the C-NC Value method (Frantzi et
al., 1999). In the second stage, the list of MWTs
extracted is revised and re-ranked with a con-
trastive score, based on the distribution of terms
across corpora of different domains; in particu-
77
lar, the Contrastive Selection of multi-word terms
(CSmw) function, newly introduced in Bonin et
al. (2010), was used, which proved to be partic-
ularly suitable for handling variation in low fre-
quency events. The main benefit of such an ap-
proach consists in its modularity; by first selecting
valid MWTs which have significant distributional
tendencies, and then by assessing their domain-
relevance using a contrastive function, the MWT
sparsity problem is overcome or at lest signifi-
cantly reduced.
3 Experiments
The MWT extraction methodology described
above has been followed in order to acquire envi-
ronmental terminology from three different kinds
of domain corpora. The first experiment has been
carried out on a corpus of scientific articles con-
cerning climate change research of Italian Na-
tional Research Council (CNR), of 397,297 to-
kens, while the second experiment has been car-
ried out on a corpus of Wikipedia articles from
the Italian Portal ?Ecologia e Ambiente? (Ecol-
ogy and Environment) (174,391 tokens). As gen-
eral contrastive corpus, we used, in both cases,
the PAROLE Corpus (Marinelli et al, 2003)1, in
order to filter out GL lexical items. The third
and more challenging experiment has been car-
ried out on a collection of Italian European legal
texts concerning the environmental domain for a
total of 394,088 word tokens. In this case, as con-
trastive corpus we exploited a collection of Ital-
ian European legal texts regulating a domain other
than the environmental one2, in order to extract
MWTs belonging to the environmental domain,
but also to single out legal-domain terms, used in
legal texts. For each acquisition corpus we fol-
lowed the two-layered approach described above,
selecting, firstly, a top list of 2000 environmental
MWTs from the candidate term list ranked on the
C-NC Value score and, secondly, re-ranking this
2000-term list on the basis of the CSmw function;
then we extracted the final top list of 300 envi-
ronmental MWTs. In order to assess the effec-

cludes Italian texts of different types.

protection domain for a total of 74,210 word tokens.
tiveness of the approach against different types of
corpora, we analyzed the two 300-term top lists
of MWTs acquired respectively after the first and
the second extraction steps. In both cases, we
divided the 300-term top lists in 30-term groups
which show domain-specific terms? distribution,
so that they could be easily compared. The eval-
uation has been carried out by comparing the lists
of MWTs extracted against a gold standard re-
source, i.e. the thesaurus EARTh (Environmen-
tal Applications Reference Thesaurus).3. In ad-
dition, a second resource has been used in the
third experiment for evaluating legal terms: the
Dizionario giuridico (Edizioni Simone)4. Those
terms which could not find a positive matching
against the gold standard resources were manually
validated by domain experts.

3.1 Discussion of Results
Achieved experimental results highlight two main
issues. Firstly, they show that the proposed con-
trastive approach to domain-specific MWTs ex-
traction has a general good performance. As Fig-
ures 1, 2 and 3 show, the amount of environ-
mental MWTs after the contrastive stage increases
with respect to the amount of MWTs acquired af-

out with the C-NC Value method. Secondly, re-
ported results witness that such performances are
differently affected by the different types of in-
put corpora: as summarized in Table 3, the rela-
tive increment of environmental MWTs after the
contrastive filtering stage ranges from 11.3% to
23.81%. Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, the
results obtained in the first and second experi-
ments show similar trends. This is due to the over-

expected, Wikipedia texts contain highly special-
ized terminology. However, a qualititative evalu-
ation of MTWs extracted revealed that this latter
corpus includes terms which belong to that bor-
derline area between GL and SL (case c. in the
Cabre? (1999) classification). It follows that in
the Wikipedia case the contrastive stage filtered
out not only common words, such as milione di
dollari ?a million dollars?, but also terms such as
unita` immobiliare ?real estate? belonging to such
borderline area of terminology; their difficult clas-
sification slightly decreases the contrastive stage
performance.
In the third experiment, the total amount of
environmental MWTs percentually increased by
23.81% after the second stage of contrastive re-
ranking. Differently from the previous experi-
ments, in this case we faced the need for dis-
cerning terms belonging to the vocabulary of two
SLs, i.e. regulated domain (i.e. environmental)
terms and legal ones (e.g. norma nazionale, na-
tional rule): this emerges clearly from the results
reported in Table 2 where it is shown that the
same number of environmental and legal MWTs
(i.e. 12 terms) are extracted at the first stage in
the first 30-term group, and that the contrastive
re-ranking allows the emergence of 21 environ-
mental MWTs against 4 legal MWTs only. This
trend can be observed in Figure 4, where the di-
vergent lines show the different distributions of
environmental and legal terms: interestingly, lines
cross each other where legal terms outnumber en-
vironmental terms, i.e. in the last 30-term group.
Such a relative increment with respect to the C-
NC Value ranking can be easily explained in terms
of the main features of the two methods, where C-
NC Value method is overtly aimed at extracting
domain-specific terminology (both environmental
and legal terms), and the contrastive re-ranking
step is specifically aimed at distinguishing the rel-
evance of acquired MWTs with respect to the in-
volved domains.

In this paper we tackled the challenging task of

approach proposed in Bonin et al (2010) can be
successfully exploited in distinguishing between

relevance of extracted terms. The latter is the case

from different text types proved that the perfor-

Abstract
In this paper we present ULISSE, an unsu-
pervised linguistically?driven algorithm to se-
lect reliable parses from the output of a de-
pendency parser. Different experiments were
devised to show that the algorithm is robust
enough to deal with the output of different
parsers and with different languages, as well
as to be used across different domains. In
all cases, ULISSE appears to outperform the
baseline algorithms.
1 Introduction
While the accuracy of state?of?the?art parsers is in-
creasing more and more, this is still not enough for
their output to be used in practical NLP?based ap-
plications. In fact, when applied to real?world texts
(e.g. the web or domain?specific corpora such as
bio?medical literature, legal texts, etc.) their accu-
racy decreases significantly. This is a real problem
since it is broadly acknowledged that applications
such as Information Extraction, Question Answer-
ing, Machine Translation, and so on can benefit sig-
nificantly from exploiting the output of a syntactic
parser. To overcome this problem, over the last few
years a growing interest has been shown in assessing
the reliability of automatically produced parses: the
selection of high quality parses represents nowadays
a key and challenging issue. The number of stud-
ies devoted to detecting reliable parses from the out-
put of a syntactic parser is spreading. They mainly
differ with respect to the kind of selection algo-
rithm they exploit. Depending on whether training
data, machine learning classifiers or external parsers
are exploited, existing algorithms can be classified
into i) supervised?based, ii) ensemble?based and iii)
unsupervised?based methods.
The first is the case of the construction of a ma-
chine learning classifier to predict the reliability of
parses on the basis of different feature types. Yates
et al (2006) exploited semantic features derived
from the web to create a statistical model to de-
tect unreliable parses produced by a constituency
parser. Kawahara and Uchimoto (2008) relied on
features derived from the output of a supervised de-
pendency parser (e.g. dependency lengths, num-
ber of unknown words, number of coordinated con-
junctions, etc.), whereas Ravi et al (2008) exploited
an external constituency parser to extract text?based
features (e.g. sentence length, unknown words, etc.)
as well as syntactic features to develop a super-
vised predictor of the target parser accuracy. The
approaches proposed by Reichart and Rappoport
(2007a) and Sagae and Tsujii (2007) can be classi-
fied as ensemble?based methods. Both select high
quality parses by computing the level of agreement
among different parser outputs: wheras the former
uses several versions of a constituency parser, each
trained on a different sample from the training data,
the latter uses the parses produced by different de-
pendency parsing algorithms trained on the same
data. However, a widely acknowledged problem of
both supervised?based and ensemble?based meth-
ods is that they are dramatically influenced by a) the
selection of the training data and b) the accuracy and
the typology of errors of the used parser.
To our knowledge, Reichart and Rappoport
(2009a) are the first to address the task of high qual-
115
ity parse selection by resorting to an unsupervised?
based method. The underlying idea is that syntactic
structures that are frequently created by a parser are
more likely to be correct than structures produced
less frequently. For this purpose, their PUPA (POS?
based Unsupervised Parse Assessment Algorithm)
uses statistics about POS tag sequences of parsed
sentences produced by an unsupervised constituency
parser.
In this paper, we address this unsupervised sce-
nario with two main novelties: unlike Reichart and
Rappoport (2009a), a) we address the reliable parses
selection task using an unsupervised method in a
supervised parsing scenario, and b) we operate on
dependency?based representations. Similarly to Re-
ichart and Rappoport (2009a) we exploit text inter-
nal statistics: but whereas they rely on features that
are closely related to constituency representations,
we use linguistic features which are dependency?
motivated. The proposed algorithm has been eval-
uated for selecting reliable parses from English and
Italian corpora; to our knowledge, this is the first
time that such a task has been applied to a less re-
sourced language such as Italian. The paper is or-
ganised as follows: in Section 2 we illustrate the
ULISSE algorithm; sections 3 and 4 are devoted to
the used parsers and baselines. Section 5 describes
the experiments and discusses achieved results.
2 The ULISSE Algorithm
The ULISSE (Unsupervised LInguiStically?driven
Selection of dEpendency parses) algorithm takes as
input a set of parsed sentences and it assigns to each
dependency tree a score quantifying its reliability. It
operates in two different steps: 1) it collects statis-
tics about a set of linguistically?motivated features
extracted from a corpus of parsed sentences; 2) it
calculates a quality (or reliability) score for each an-
alyzed sentence using the feature statistics extracted
from the whole corpus.
2.1 Selection of features
The features exploited by ULISSE are all linguis-
tically motivated and rely on the dependency tree
structure. Different criteria guided their selection.
First, as pointed out in Roark et al (2007), we
needed features which could be reliably identified
within the automatic output of a parser. Second,
we focused on dependency structures that are widely
agreed in the literature a) to reflect sentences? syn-
tactic and thus parsing complexity and b) to impose
a high cognitive load on the parsing of a complete
sentence.
Here follows the list of features used in the exper-
iments reported in this paper, which turned out to be
the most effective ones for the task at hand.
Parse tree depth: this feature is a reliable indicator
of sentence complexity due to the fact that, with sen-
tences of approximately the same length, parse tree
depth can be indicative of increased sentence com-
plexity (Yngve, 1960; Frazier, 1985; Gibson, 1998;
Nenkova, 2010).
Depth of embedded complement ?chains?: this
feature is a subtype of the previous one, focusing on
the depth of chains of embedded complements, ei-
ther prepositional complements or nominal and ad-
jectival modifiers. Long chains of embedded com-
plements make the syntactic structure more complex
and their analysis much more difficult.
Arity of verbal predicates: this feature refers to the
number of dependency links sharing the same ver-
bal head. Here, there is no obvious relation between
the number of dependents and sentence complexity:
both a small number and a high number of depen-
dents can make the sentence processing quite com-
plex, although for different reasons (elliptical con-
structions in the former case, a high number of mod-
ifiers in the latter).
Verbal roots: this feature counts the number of ver-
bal roots with respect to number of all sentence roots
in the target corpus.
Subordinate vs main clauses: subordination is gen-
erally considered to be an index of structural com-
plexity in language. Two distinct features are con-
sidered for monitoring this aspect: one measuring
the ratio between main and subordinate clauses and
the other one focusing on the relative ordering of
subordinate clauses with respect to the main clause.
It is a widely acknowledged fact that highly com-
plex sentences contain deeply embedded subordi-
nate clauses; however, subordinate clauses are easier
to process if they occur in post?verbal rather than in
pre?verbal position (Miller, 1998).
Length of dependency links: McDonald and Nivre
(2007) report that statistical parsers have a drop in
116
accuracy when analysing long distance dependen-
cies. This is in line with Lin (1996) and Gibson
(1998) who claim that the syntactic complexity of
sentences can be predicted with measures based on
the length of dependency links, given the memory
overhead of very long distance dependencies. Here,
the dependency length is measured in terms of the
words occurring between the syntactic head and the
dependent.
Dependency link plausibility (henceforth, Arc-
POSFeat): this feature is used to calculate the plausi-
bility of a dependency link given the part?of?speech
of the dependent and the head, by also considering
the PoS of the head father and the dependency link-
ing the two.
2.2 Computation Score
The quality score (henceforth, QS) of parsed sen-
tences results from a combination of the weights as-
sociated with the monitored features. ULISSE is
modular and can use several weights combination
strategies, which may be customised with respect to
the specific task exploiting the output of ULISSE.
For this study, QS is computed as a simple prod-
uct of the individual feature weights. This follows
from the necessity to recognize high quality parses
within the input set of parsed sentences: the prod-
uct combination strategy is able to discard low qual-
ity parse trees even in presence of just one low
weight feature. Therefore, QS for each sentence i
in the set of input parsed sentences I is QS(Si) =?n
y=1 Weight(Si, fy), where Si is the i?th sentence
of I , n is the total number of selected features and
Weight(Si, fy) is the computed weight for the y?th
feature.
Selected features can be divided into two classes,
depending on whether they are computed with re-
spect to each sentence and averaged over all sen-
tences in the target corpus (global features), or they
are computed with respect to individual dependency
links and averaged over all of them (local features).
The latter is the case of the ArcPOSFeat feature,
whereas the all other ones represent global features.
For the global features, the Weight(Si, fy) is de-
fined as:
Weight(Si, fy) = F (V (fy), range(L(Si), r))|range(L(Si), r)| ,
(1)
where V (fy) is the value of the y?th feature (ex-
tracted from Si), L(Si) is the length of the sen-
tence Si, range(L(Si), r) defines a range cov-
ering values from L(Si) ? r and L(Si) + r,
F (V (fy), range(L(Si), r)) is the frequency of
V (fy) in all sentences in I that has a value of
length in range(L(Si), r1) and |range(L(Si), r)|
is the total number of sentences in I with length
in range(L(Si), r). For what concerns the lo-
cal feature ArcPOSFeat, ULISSE assigns a weight
for each arc in Si: in principle different strate-
gies can be used to compute a unique weight for
this feature for Si. Here, the sentence weight
for the feature ArcPOSFeat is computed as the
minimum weight among the weights of all arcs
of Si. Therefore, Weight(Si, ArcPOSFeat) =
min{weight((Pd, Ph, t)), ?(Pd, Ph, t) ? Si},
where the triple (Pd, Ph, t) is an arc in Si in which
Pd is the POS of the dependent, Ph is the POS
of the syntactic head and t is the type of the de-
pendency relation and weight((Pd, Ph, t)) is the
weight of the specific arc (Pd, Ph, t). The individ-
ual arc weight is computed as follows:
weight((Pd, Ph, t)) = F ((Pd, Ph, t))F ((Pd,X, t)) ?
? F ((Pd, Ph, t))F ((X,Ph, t)) ?
? F (((Pd, Ph, t)(Ph, Ph2, t2)))F ((Pd, Ph, t)) ?
? F (((Pd, Ph, t)(Ph, Ph2, t2)))F ((Ph, Ph2, t2)) ?
? F (((Pd, Ph, t)(Ph, Ph2, t2)))F ((((Pd,X, t))(X,Ph2, t2))) ,
where F (x) is the frequency of x in I , X is a vari-
able and (arc1 arc2) represent two consecutive arcs
in the tree.
3 The Parsers
ULISSE was tested against the output of two really
different data?driven parsers: the first?order Max-
imum Spanning Tree (MST) parser (McDonald et
al., 2006) and the DeSR parser (Attardi, 2006) using
Support Vector Machine as learning algorithm. The

out?of?domain experiment reported in Sec 5.3.
117
former is a graph?based parser (following the so?
called ?all?pairs? approach Buchholz et al (2006))
where every possible arc is considered in the con-
struction of the optimal parse tree and where depen-
dency parsing is represented as the search for a max-
imum spanning tree in a directed graph. The latter
is a Shift?Reduce parser (following a ?stepwise? ap-
proach, Buchholz et al (2006)), where the parser
is trained and learns the sequence of parsing actions
required to build the parse tree.
Although both parser models show a similar accu-
racy, McDonald and Nivre (2007) demonstrate that
the two types of models exhibit different behaviors.
Their analysis exemplifies how different the two
parsers behave when their accuracies are compared
with regard to some linguistic features of the ana-
lyzed sentences. To mention only a few, the Shift?
Reduce parser tends to perform better on shorter
sentences, while the MST parser guarantees a higher
accuracy in identifying long distance dependencies.
As regards the identification of dependency types,
the MST parser shows a better ability to identify
the dependents of the sentences? roots whereas the
Shift?Reduce tends to better recognize specific rela-
tions (e.g. Subject and Object).
McDonald and Nivre (2007) describe how the
systems? behavioral differences are due to the dif-
ferent parsing algorithms implemented by the Shift?
Reduce and the MST parsing models. The Shift
Reduce parser constructs a dependency tree by per-
forming a sequence of parser actions or transitions
through a greedy parsing strategy. As a result of
this parsing procedure, a Shift Reduce parser cre-
ates shorter arcs before longer arcs. The latter could
be the reason for the lower accuracy in identifying
longer arcs when compared to the MST parser. This
also influences a lower level of accuracy in the anal-
ysis of longer sentences that usually contain longer
arcs than shorter sentences. The MST parser?s abil-
ity to analyze both short and long arcs is invariant
as it employs a graph-based parsing method where
every possible arc is considered in the construction
of the dependency tree.
4 The Baselines
Three different increasingly complex baseline mod-
els were used to evaluate the performance of
ULISSE.
The first baseline is constituted by a Random Se-
lection (RS ) of sentences from the test sets. This
baseline is calculated in terms of the scores of the
parser systems on the test set.
The second baseline is represented by the Sen-
tence Length (SL ), starting from the assumption,
demonstrated by McDonald and Nivre (2007), that
long sentences are harder to analyse using statistical
dependency parsers than short ones. This is a strong
unsupervised baseline based on raw text features,
ranking the parser results from the shortest sentence
to the longest one.
The third and most advanced baseline, exploiting
parse features, is the PUPA algorithm (Reichart and
Rappoport, 2007a). PUPA uses a set of parsed sen-
tences to compute the statistics on which its scores
are based. The PUPA algorithm operates on a con-
stituency based representation and collects statistics
about the POS tags of the words in the yield of the
constituent and of the words in the yields of neigh-
boring constituents. The sequences of POS tags that
are more frequent in target corpus receive higher
scores after proper regularization is applied to pre-
vent potential biases. Therefore, the final score as-
signed to a constituency tree results from a combina-
tion of the scores of its extracted sequences of POSs.
In order to use PUPA as a baseline, we imple-
mented a dependency?based version, hencefoth re-
ferred to as dPUPA. dPUPA uses the same score
computation of PUPA and collects statistics about
sequences of POS tags: the difference lies in the fact
that in this case the POS sequences are not extracted
from constituency trees but rather from dependency
trees. To be more concrete, rather than represent-
ing a sentence as a collection of constituency?based
sequences of POSs, dPUPA represents each sen-
tence as a collection of sequences of POSs cov-
ering all identified dependency subtrees. In par-
ticular, each dependency tree is represented as the
set of all subtrees rooted by non?terminal nodes.
Each subtree is then represented as the sequence
of POS tags of the words in the subtree (reflect-
ing the word order of the original sentence) inte-
grated with the POS of the leftmost and rightmost
in the sentence (NULL when there are no neigh-
bors). Figure 1 shows the example of the depen-
dency tree for the sentence I will give you the ball.
118
Figure 1: Example of dependency tree.
If we consider the subtree rooted by give (in the
dotted circle), the resulting POS sequence is as
follows: POS2 POS3 POS4 POS5 POS6 NULL,
where POS3 POS4 POS5 POS6 is the sequence of
POS tags in the subtree, POS2 is the left neighbor
POS tag and NULL marks the absence of a right
neighbor.
5 Experiments and Results
The experiments were organised as follows: a target
corpus was automatically POS tagged (Dell?Orletta,
2009) and dependency?parsed; the ULISSE and
baseline algorithms of reliable parse selection were
run on the POS?tagged and dependency?parsed tar-
get corpus in order to identify high quality parses;
results achieved by the selection algorithms were
evaluated with respect to a subset of the target cor-
pus of about 5,000 word?tokens (henceforth referred
to as ?test set?) for which gold-standard annotation
was available. Different sets of experiments were
devised to test the robustness of our algorithm. They
were performed with respect to i) the output of the
parsers described in Section 3, ii) two different lan-
guages, iii) different domains.
For what concerns the languages, we chose Italian
and English for two main reasons. First of all, they
pose different challenges to a parser since they are
characterised by quite different syntactic features.
For instance, Italian, as opposed to English, is char-
acterised by a relatively free word order (especially
for what concerns subject and object relations with
respect to the verb) and by the possible absence of
an overt subject. Secondly, as it is shown in Section
5.1, Italian is a less resourced language with respect
to English. This is a key issue, since as demonstrated
by Reichart and Rappoport (2007b) and McClosky
et al (2008), small and big treebanks pose different
problems in the reliable parses selection.
Last but not least, we aimed at demonstrating that
ULISSE can be successfully used not only with texts
belonging to the same domain as the parser train-
ing corpus. For this purpose, ULISSE was tested
on a target corpus of Italian legislative texts, whose
automatic linguistic analysis poses domain?specific
challenges (Venturi, 2010). Out?of?domain experi-
ments are being carried out also for English.
5.1 The Corpora
The Italian corpora Both parsers were trained on
ISST?TANL2, a dependency annotated corpus used
in Evalita?093, an evaluation campaign carried out
for Italian (Bosco et al, 2009). ISST?TANL in-
cludes 3,109 sentences (71,285 tokens) and consists
of articles from newspapers and periodicals.
Two different target corpora were used for the
in?domain and out?of?domain experiments. For
the former, we used a corpus of 1,104,237 sen-
tences (22,830,739 word?tokens) of newspapers
texts which was extracted from the CLIC-ILC Cor-
pus (Marinelli et al, 2003); for the legal domain,
we used a collection of Italian legal texts (2,697,262
word?tokens; 97,564 sentences) regulating a vari-
ety of domains, ranging from environment, human
rights, disability rights, freedom of expression to pri-
vacy, age disclaimer, etc. In the two experiments,
the test sets were represented respectively by: a) the
test set used in the Evalita?09 evaluation campaign,
constituted by 260 sentences and 5,011 tokens from
newpapers text; b) a set of 102 sentences (corre-
sponding to 5,691 tokens) from legal texts.
The English corpora For the training of parsers
we used the dependency?based version of Sections
2?11 of the Wall Street Journal partition of the
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 2003), which was de-
veloped for the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on De-
pendency Parsing (Nivre et al, 2007): it includes
447,000 word tokens and about 18,600 sentences.
As target data we took a corpus of news, specif-
ically the whole Wall Street Journal Section of the
2http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/SemaWiki
3http://evalita.fbk.eu/index.html
119
Penn Treebank4, from which the portion of text cor-
responding to the training corpus was removed; the
English target corpus thus includes 39,285,425 to-
kens (1,625,606 sentences). For testing we used
the test set of the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task, cor-
responding to a subset of Section 23 of the Wall
Street Journal partition of the Penn Treebank (5,003
tokens, 214 sentences).
5.2 Evaluation Methodology
Performances of the ULISSE algorithm have been
evaluated i) with respect to the accuracy of ranked
parses and ii) in terms of Precision and Recall. First,
for each experiment we evaluated how the ULISSE
algorithm and the baselines classify the sentences in
the test set with respect to the ?Labelled Attachment
Score? (LAS) obtained by the parsers, i.e. the per-
centage of tokens for which it has predicted the cor-
rect head and dependency relation. In particular, we
computed the LAS score of increasingly wider top
lists of k tokens, where k ranges from 500 word to-
kens to the whole size of the test set (with a step size
of 500 word tokens, i.e. k=500, k=1000, k=1500,
etc.).
As regards ii), we focused on the set of ranked
sentences showing a LAS ? ?. Since imposing
a 100% LAS was too restrictive, for each experi-
ment we defined a different ? threshold taking into
account the performance of each parser across the
different languages and domains. In particular, we
took the top 25% and 50% of the list of ranked sen-
tences and calculated Precision and Recall for each
of them. To this specific end, a parse tree showing
a LAS ? ? is considered as a trustworthy analysis.
Precision has been computed as the ratio of the num-
ber of trustworthy analyses over the total number of
sentences in each top list. Recall has been computed
as the ratio of the number of trustworthy analyses
which have been retrieved over the total number of
trustworthy analyses in the whole test set.
In order to test how the ULISSE algorithm is able
to select reliable parses by relying on parse fea-
tures rather than on raw text features, we computed
the accuracy score (LAS) of a subset of the top list
of sentences parsed by both parsers and ranked by

for the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on Dependency Parsing, do-
main adaptation track.
ULISSE: in particular, we focused on those sen-
tences which were not shared by the MST and DeSR
top lists.
5.3 Results
We will refer to the performed experiments as fol-
lows: ?IT in?domain? and ?IT out?of?domain? for
the Italian experiments using respectively the ISST?
TANL test set (henceforth ISST TS) and the Legal-
Corpus test set (henceforth Legal TS); ?EN in?
domain? for the English experiment using the PTB
test set (PTB TS).
As a starting point let us consider the accuracy
of DeSR and MST parsers on the whole test sets,
reported in Table 1. The accuracy has been com-
puted in terms of LAS and of Unlabelled Attach-
ment Score (UAS), i.e. the percentage of tokens with
a correctly identified syntactic head. It can be no-
ticed that the performance of the two parsers is quite
similar for Italian (i.e. wrt ISST TS and Legal TS),
whereas there is a 2.3% difference between the MST
and DeSR accuracy as far as English is concerned.

Table 1: Overall accuracy of DeSR and MST parsers.
The plots in Figure 2 show the LAS of parses
ranked by ULISSE and the baselines across the dif-
ferent experiments. Each plot reports the results of a
single experiment: plots in the same row report the
LAS of DeSR and MST parsers with respect to the
same test set. In all experiments, ULISSE turned out
to be the best ranking algorithm since it appears to
select top lists characterised by higher LAS scores
than the baselines. As Figure 2 shows, all ranking
algorithms perform better than Random Selection
(RS), i.e. all top lists (for each k value) show a LAS
higher than the accuracy of DeSR and MST parsers
on the whole test sets. In the EN in?domain experi-
ment, the difference between the results of ULISSE
and the other ranking algorithms is smaller than in
the corresponding Italian experiment, a fact result-
ing from the higher accuracy of DeSR and MST
parsers (i.e. LAS 85.95% and 88.25% respectively)
on the PTB TS. It follows that, for example, the
first top list (with k=500) of the SL baseline has a

Figure 2: LAS of parses ranked by ULISSE algorithm and by the three baselines.
LAS accuracy of 93.36% and 93.96% respectively
for DeSR and MST: even in this case, ULISSE out-
performs all baselines. This is also the case in the
IT out?of?domain experiment. As reported in Table
1, parsing legal texts is a quite challenging task due
to a number of domain?specific peculiarities at the
level of syntax: this is testified by the average sen-
tence length which in the Legal TS is 56 word to-
kens. Nevertheless, ULISSE is able also in this case
to highly rank long sentences showing a high LAS.
For example, while in the first top list of 500 word
tokens the sentences parsed by DeSR and ordered by
SL have an average sentence length of 24 words and
a LAS of 79.37%, ULISSE includes in the same top
list longer sentences (with average sentence length =
29) with a higher LAS (82.72%). Also dPUPA ranks
in the same top list quite long sentences (with 27 av-
erage sentence length), but compared to ULISSE it
shows a lower LAS (i.e. 73.56%).

average length in tokens of ranked sentence (AvgSL).
the fact that PUPA is based on constituency?specific
features that once translated in terms of dependency
structures may be not so effective.
In order to show that the ranking of sentences
does not follow from raw text features but rather
from parse features, we evaluated the accuracy of
parsed sentences that are not?shared by MST and
DeSR top?lists selected by ULISSE. For each test
set we selected a different top list: a set of 100
sentences in the IT and EN in?domain experiments
and of 50 sentences in the IT out?of?domain exper-
iment. For each of them we have a different number
of not?shared sentences: 24, 15 and 16 in the IT
in?domain, IT out?of?domain and EN in?domain
experiments respectively. Table 3 reports the LAS
of DeSR and MST for these sentences: it can be
observed that the LAS of not?shared sentences in
the DeSR top list is always higher than the LAS
assigned by the same parser to the not?shared sen-
tences in the MST top list, and viceversa. For in-
stance, in the English experiment the LAS achieved
by DeSR on the not?shared top list is higher (86.50)
than the LAS of DeSR on the not?shared MST top
list (83.37); viceversa, the LAS of MST on the not?
shared DeSR top list is higher (86.74) than the LAS
of MST on the not?shared MST top list (90.39). The
unique exception is MST in the IT out?of?domain
experiment, but the difference in terms of LAS be-
tween the parses is not statistically relevant (p?value
< 0.05). These results demonstrate that ULISSE is
able to select parsed sentences on the basis of the
reliability of the analysis produced by each parser.
6 Conclusion
ULISSE is an unsupervised linguistically?driven
method to select reliable parses from the output of
dependency parsers. To our knowledge, it repre-
sents the first unsupervised ranking algorithm oper-
ating on dependency representations which are more
and more gaining in popularity and are arguably
more useful for some applications than constituency
parsers. ULISSE shows a promising performance
against the output of two supervised parsers se-
lected for their behavioral differences. In all experi-
ments, ULISSE outperforms all baselines, including
dPUPA and Sentence Length (SL), the latter repre-
senting a very strong baseline selection method in a
supervised scenario, where parsers have a very high
performance with short sentences. The fact of car-
rying out the task of reliable parse selection in a su-
pervised scenario represents an important novelty:
however, the unsupervised nature of ULISSE could
also be used in an unsupervised scenario (Reichart
and Rappoport, 2010). Current direction of research
include a careful study of a) the quality score func-
tion, in particular for what concerns the combination
of individual feature weights, and b) the role and ef-
fectivess of the set of linguistic features. This study
is being carried out with a specific view to NLP tasks
which might benefit from the ULISSE algorithm.
This is the case, for instance, of the domain adap-
tation task in a self?training scenario (McClosky et
al., 2006), of the treebank construction process by
minimizing the human annotators? efforts (Reichart
and Rappoport, 2009b), of n?best ranking methods
for machine translation (Zhang, 2006).

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new approach to
readability assessment with a specific view to
the task of text simplification: the intended
audience includes people with low literacy
skills and/or with mild cognitive impairment.
READ?IT represents the first advanced read-
ability assessment tool for what concerns Ital-
ian, which combines traditional raw text fea-
tures with lexical, morpho-syntactic and syn-
tactic information. In READ?IT readability
assessment is carried out with respect to both
documents and sentences where the latter rep-
resents an important novelty of the proposed
approach creating the prerequisites for align-
ing the readability assessment step with the
text simplification process. READ?IT shows
a high accuracy in the document classification
task and promising results in the sentence clas-
sification scenario.
1 Introduction
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the
exploitation of results from Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) for the development of assistive tech-
nologies. Here, we address this topic by reporting
the first but promising results in the development
of a software architecture for the Italian language
aimed at assisting people with low literacy skills
(both native and foreign speakers) or who have lan-
guage disabilities in reading texts.
Within an information society, where everyone
should be able to access all available information,
improving access to written language is becoming
more and more a central issue. This is the case, for
instance, of administrative and governmental infor-
mation which should be accessible to all members of
the society, including people who have reading dif-
ficulties for different reasons: because of a low edu-
cation level or because of the fact that the language
in question is not their mother tongue, or because
of language disabilities. Health related information
represents another crucial domain which should be
accessible to a large and heterogenous target group.
Understandability in general and readability in par-
ticular is also an important issue for accessing infor-
mation over the web as stated in the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) proposed by the
Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C.
In this paper, we describe the approach we devel-
oped for automatically assessing the readability of
newspaper texts with a view to the specific task of
text simplification. The paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes the background literature
on the topic; Section 3 introduces the main features
of our approach to readability assessment, with Sec-
tion 4 illustrating its implementation in the READ-
IT prototype; Sections 5 and 6 describe the experi-
mental setting and discuss achieved results.
2 Background
Readability assessment has been a central research
topic for the past 80 years which is still attracting
considerable interest nowadays. Over the last ten
years, within the NLP community the automatic as-
sessment of readability has received increasing at-
tention: if on the one hand the availability of sophis-
ticated NLP technologies makes it possible to moni-
tor a wide variety of factors affecting the readability
73
of a text, on the other hand there is a wide range
of both human- and machine-oriented applications
which can benefit from it.
Traditional readability formulas focus on a lim-
ited set of superficial text features which are taken
as rough approximations of the linguistic factors at
play in readability assessment. For example, the
Flesch-Kincaid measure (the most common reading
difficulty measure still in use, Kincaid (1975)) is a
linear function of the average number of syllables
per word and of the average number of words per
sentence, where the former and latter are used as
simple proxies for lexical and syntactic complexity
respectively. For Italian, there are two readability
formulas: an adaptation of the Flesh-Kincaid for En-
glish to Italian known as the Flesch-Vacca formula
(Franchina and Vacca, 1986); the GulpEase index
(Lucisano and Piemontese, 1988), assessing read-
ability on the basis of the average number of char-
acters per word and the average number of words
per sentence.
A widely acknowledged fact is that all traditional
readability metrics are quick and easy to calculate
but have drawbacks. For example, the use of sen-
tence length as a measure of syntactic complexity as-
sumes that a longer sentence is more grammatically
complex than a shorter one, which is often but not
always the case. Word syllable count is used start-
ing from the assumption that more frequent words
are more likely to have fewer syllables than less fre-
quent ones (an association that is related to Zipf?s
Law, Zipf (1935)); yet, similarly to the previous
case, word length does not necessarily reflects its
difficulty. The unreliability of these metrics has been
experimentally demonstrated by several recent stud-
ies in the field: to mention only a few Si and Callan
(2001), Petersen and Ostendorf (2006), Feng (2009).
On the front of the assessment of the lexical dif-
ficulty of a given text, a first step forward is rep-
resented by vocabulary-based formulas such as the
Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995), using
a combination of average sentence length and word
frequency counts. In particular, for what concerns
the latter it reconstructs the percentage of words
not on a list of 3000 ?easy? words by matching its
own list to the words in the material being evalu-
ated, to determine the appropriate reading level. If
vocabulary-based measures represent an improve-
ment in assessing the readability of texts which was
possible due to the availability of frequency dictio-
naries and reference corpora, they are still unsatis-
factory for what concerns sentence structure.
Over the last ten years, work on readability de-
ployed sophisticated NLP techniques, such as syn-
tactic parsing and statistical language modeling, to
capture more complex linguistic features and used
statistical machine learning to build readability as-
sessment tools. A variety of different NLP-based
approaches to the automatic readability assessment
has been proposed so far, differing with respect to:
a) the typology of features taken into account (e.g.
lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse), and, for each
type, at the level of the inventory of used individual
features; b) the intended audience of the texts under
evaluation, which strongly influences the readability
assessment, and last but not least c) the application
within which readability assessment is carried out.
Interesting alternatives to static vocabulary-based
measures have been put forward by Si and Callan
(2001) who used unigram language models com-
bined with sentence length to capture content in-
formation from scientific web pages, or by Collins-
Thompson and Callan (2004) who adopted a sim-
ilar language modeling approach (Smoothed Uni-
gram model) to predict reading difficulty of short
passages and web documents. These approaches can
be seen as a generalization of the vocabulary-based
approach, aimed at capturing finer-grained and more
flexible information about vocabulary usage. If un-
igram language models help capturing important
content information and variation of word usage,
they do not cover other types of features which are
reported to play a significant role in the assessment
of readability. More recently, the role of syntac-
tic features started being investigated (Schwarm and
Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al, 2007; Petersen and
Ostendorf, 2009): in these studies syntactic structure
is tracked through a combination of features from n-
gram (trigram, bigram and unigram) language mod-
els and parse trees (parse tree height, number of
noun phrases, verb phrases and subordinated clauses
or SBARs) with more traditional features.
Yet, besides lexical and syntactic complexity fea-
tures there are other important factors, such as the
structure of the text, the definition of discourse topic,
discourse cohesion and coherence and so on, play-
74
ing a central role in determining the reading diffi-
culty of a text. More recent approaches esplored
the role of these features in readability assessment:
this is the case, for instance, of Barzilay and Lap-
ata (2008) or Feng (2010). The last few years have
been characterised by approaches based on the com-
bination of features ranging over different linguistic
levels, namely lexical, syntactic and discourse (see
e.g. Pitler and Nenkova (2008), Kate (2010)).
Another important factor determining the typol-
ogy of features to be considered for assessing read-
ability has to do with the intended audience of
readers: it is commonly agreed that reading ease
does not follow from intrinsic text properties alone,
but it is also affected by the expected audience.
Among the studies addressing readability with re-
spect to specific audiences, it is worth mentioning
here: Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) and Heilman
et al (2007) dealing with language learners, or Feng
(2009) focussing on people with mild intellectual
disabilities. Interestingly,Heilman et al (2007) dif-
ferentiate the typology of used features when ad-
dressing first (L1) or second (L2) language learn-
ers: they argue that grammatical features are more
relevant for L2 than for L1 learners. Feng (2009)
propose a set of cognitively motivated features op-
erating at the discourse level specifically addressing
the cognitive characteristics of the expected users.
When readability is targeted towards adult compe-
tent language users a more prominent role is played
by discourse features (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).
Applications which can benefit from an automatic
readability assessment range from the selection of
reading material tailored to varying literacy levels
(e.g. for L1/L2 students or low literacy people)
and the ranking of documents by reading difficulty
(e.g. in returning the results of web queries) to NLP
tasks such as automatic document summarization,
machine translation as well as text simplification.
Again, also the application making use of the read-
ability assessment, which is in turn strictly related to
the intended audience of readers, strongly influences
the typology of features to be taken into account.
Advanced NLP?based readability metrics devel-
oped so far typically deal with English, with a few
attempts devoted to other languages, namely French
(Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), Portuguese
(Aluisio et al, 2010) and German (Bru?ck, 2008).
3 Our Approach
Our approach to readability assessment was devel-
oped with a specific application in mind, i.e. text
simplification, and addresses a specific target audi-
ence of readers, namely people characterised by low
literacy skills and/or by mild cognitive impairment.
Following the most recent approaches, we treat read-
ability assessment as a classification task: in partic-
ular, given the available corpora for the Italian lan-
guage as well as the type of target audience, we re-
sorted to a binary classification aimed at discerning
easy?to?read textual objects from difficult?to?read
ones. The language dealt with is Italian: to our
knowledge, this is the first attempt of an advanced
methodology for readability assessment for this lan-
guage. Our approach focuses on lexical and syntac-
tic features, whose selection was influenced by the
application, the intended audience and the language
dealt with (both for its intrinsic linguistic features
and for the fact of being a less resourced language).
Following Roark (2007), in the features selection
process we preferred easy-to-identify features which
could be reliably identified within the output of NLP
tools. Last but not least, as already done by Aluisio
et al (2010) the set of selected syntactic features also
includes simplification oriented ones, with the final
aim of aligning the readability assessment step with
the text simplification process.
Another qualifying feature of our approach to
readability assessment consists in the fact that we
are dealing with two types of textual objects: docu-
ments and sentences. The latter represents an impor-
tant novelty of our work since so far most research
focused on readability classification at the document
level (Skory and Eskenazi, 2010). When the tar-
get application is text simplification, we strongly be-
lieve that also assessing readability at the sentence
level could be very useful. We know that methods
developed so far perform well to characterize the
level of an entire document, but they are unreliable
for short texts and thus also for single sentences.
Sentence-based readability assessment thus repre-
sents a further challenge we decided to tackle: in
fact, if all sentences occurring in simplified texts can
be assumed to be easy-to-read sentences, the reverse
does not necessarily hold since not all sentences oc-
curring in complex texts are difficult-to-read sen-
75
tences. Since there are no training data at the sen-
tence level, it becomes difficult ? if not impossible
? to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, i.e.
erroneous readability assessments within the class
of difficult-to-read texts may either correspond to
those easy?to?read sentences occurring within com-
plex texts or represent real classification errors. In
order to overcome this problem in the readability as-
sessment of individual sentences, we introduced a
notion of distance with respect to easy-to-read sen-
tences. In this way, the prerequisites are created for
the integration of the two processes of readability as-
sessment and text simplification. Before, text read-
ability was assessed with respect to the entire doc-
ument and text simplification was carried out at the
sentence level: due to the decoupling of the two pro-
cesses, the impact of simplification operations on the
overall readability level of the text was not always
immediately clear. With sentence-based readability
assessment, this should be no longer a problem.
4 READ?IT
Our approach to readability assessment has been im-
plemented in a software prototype, henceforth re-
ferred to as READ?IT. READ?IT operates on syn-
tactically (i.e. dependency) parsed texts and it as-
signs to each considered reading object - either a
document or a sentence - a score quantifying its
readability. READ?IT is a classifier based on Sup-
port Vector Machines using LIBSVM (Chang and
Lin, 2001) that, given a set of features and a training
corpus, creates a statistical model using the feature
statistics extracted from the training corpus. Such
a model is used in the assessment of readability of
unseen documents and sentences.
The set of features used to build the statistical
model can be parameterized through a configura-
tion file: as we will see, the set of relevant fea-
tures used for readability assessment at the docu-
ment level differs from the those used at the sen-
tence level. This also creates the prerequisites for
specialising the readability assessment measure with
respect to more specific target audiences: as pointed
out in Heilman et al (2007) different types of fea-
tures come into play e.g. when addressing L1 or L2
language learners. Here follows the complete list of
features used in the reported experiments.
4.1 Features
The features used for predicting readability are or-
ganised into four main categories: namely, raw text
features, lexical features as well as morpho-syntactic
and syntactic features. This proposed four?fold par-
tition closely follows the different levels of linguis-
tic analysis automatically carried out on the text be-
ing evaluated, i.e. tokenization, lemmatization, PoS
tagging and dependency parsing. Such a partition
was meant to identify those easy to extract features
with high discriminative power in order to reduce
the linguistic pre-processing of texts guaranteeing at
the same time a reliable readability assessment.
Raw Text Features
They refer to those features typically used within tra-
ditional readability metrics. They include Sentence
Length, calculated as the average number of words
per sentence, and Word Length, calculated as the av-
erage number of characters per words.
Lexical Features
Basic Italian Vocabulary rate features: these fea-
tures refer to the internal composition of the vocab-
ulary of the text. To this end, we took as a refer-
ence resource the Basic Italian Vocabulary by De
Mauro (2000), including a list of 7000 words highly
familiar to native speakers of Italian. In particular,
we calculated two different features corresponding
to: i) the percentage of all unique words (types)
on this reference list (calculated on a per?lemma
basis); ii) the internal distribution of the occurring
basic Italian vocabulary words into the usage clas-
sification classes of ?fundamental words? (very fre-
quent words), ?high usage words? (frequent words)
and ?high availability words? (relatively lower fre-
quency words referring to everyday objects or ac-
tions and thus well known to speakers). Whereas
the latter represents a novel feature in the readability
assessment literature, the former originates from the
Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and, as
implemented here, it can be seen as the complement
of the type out-of-vocabulary rate features used by
Petersen and Ostendorf (2009).
Type/Token Ratio: this feature refers to the ratio
between the number of lexical types and the num-
ber of tokens. This feature, which can be consid-
ered as an indicator of expressive language delay or
76
disorder as shown in Wright (2003) for adults and
in Retherford (2003) for children, has already been
used for readability assessment purposes by Aluisio
et al (2010). Due to its sensitivity to sample size,
this feature has been computed for text samples of
equivalent length.
Morpho?syntactic Features
Language Model probability of Part-Of-Speech
unigrams: this feature is based on a unigram lan-
guage model assuming that the probability of a token
is independent of its context. The model is simply
defined by a list of types (POS) and their individual
probabilities. This feature has already been shown
to be a reliable indicator for automatic readability
assessment (see, for example, Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) and Aluisio et al (2010)).
Lexical density: this feature refers to the ratio of
content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs)
to the total number of lexical tokens in a text. Con-
tent words have already been used for readability as-
sessment by Aluisio et al (2010) and Feng (2010).
Verbal mood: this feature refers to the distribution
of verbs according to their mood. It is a novel and
language?specific feature exploiting the predictive
power of the Italian rich verbal morphology.
Syntactic Features
Unconditional probability of dependency types:
this feature refers to the unconditional probability of
different types of syntactic dependencies (e.g. sub-
ject, direct object, modifier, etc.) and can be seen
as the dependency-based counterpart of the ?phrase
type rate? feature used by Nenkova (2010).
Parse tree depth features: parse tree depth can be
indicative of increased sentence complexity as stated
by, to mention only a few, Yngve (1960), Frazier
(1985) and Gibson (1998). This set of features is
meant to capture different aspects of the parse tree
depth and includes the following measures: a) the
depth of the whole parse tree, calculated in terms of
the longest path from the root of the dependency tree
to some leaf; b) the average depth of embedded com-
plement ?chains? governed by a nominal head and
including either prepositional complements or nomi-
nal and adjectival modifiers; c) the probability distri-
bution of embedded complement ?chains? by depth.
The first feature has already been used in syntax-
based readability assessment studies (Schwarm and
Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al, 2007; Nenkova,
2010); the latter two are reminiscent of the ?head
noun modifiers? feature used by Nenkova (2010).
Verbal predicates features: this set of features cap-
tures different aspects of the behaviour of verbal
predicates. They range from the number of verbal
roots with respect to number of all sentence roots
occurring in a text to their arity. The arity of verbal
predicates is calculated as the number of instanti-
ated dependency links sharing the same verbal head
(covering both arguments and modifiers). Although
there is no obvious relation between the number of
verb dependents and sentence complexity, we be-
lieve that both a low and a high number of depen-
dents can make sentence readability quite complex,
although for different reasons (elliptical construc-
tions in the former case, a high number of modifiers
in the latter). Within this feature set we also con-
sidered the distribution of verbal predicates by arity.
To our knowledge, this set of features has never been
used so far for readability assessment purposes.
Subordination features: subordination is widely
acknowledged to be an index of structural complex-
ity in language. As in Aluisio et al (2010), this set
of features has been introduced here with a specific
view to the text simplification task. A first feature
was meant to measure the distribution of subordi-
nate vs main clauses. For subordinates, we also
considered their relative ordering with respect to
the main clause: according to Miller and Weinert
(1998), sentences containing subordinate clauses in
post?verbal rather than in pre?verbal position are
easier to read. Two further features were intro-
duced to capture the depth of embedded subordinate
clauses since it is a widely acknowledged fact that
highly complex sentences contain deeply embedded
subordinate clauses: in particular, a) the average
depth of ?chains? of embedded subordinate clauses
and b) the probability distribution of embedded sub-
ordinate clauses ?chains? by depth.
Length of dependency links feature: both Lin
(1996) and Gibson (1998) showed that the syntactic
complexity of sentences can be predicted with mea-
sures based on the length of dependency links. This
is also demonstrated in McDonald and Nivre (2007)
who claim that statistical parsers have a drop in ac-
curacy when analysing long dependencies. Here, the
77
dependency length is measured in terms of the words
occurring between the syntactic head and the depen-
dent. This feature is the dependency-based counter-
part of the ?phrase length? feature used for readabil-
ity assessment by Nenkova (2010) and Feng (2010).
5 The Corpora
One challenge in this work was finding an appropri-
ate corpus. Although a possibly large collection of
texts labelled with their target grade level (such as
the Weekly Reader for English) would be ideal, we
are not aware of any such collection that exists for
Italian in electronic form. Instead, to test our ap-
proach to automatically identify the readability of a
given text, we used two different corpora: a news-
paper corpus, La Repubblica (henceforth, ?Rep?),
and an easy?to?read newspaper, Due Parole (hence-
forth, ?2Par?) which was specifically written for an
audience of adults with a rudimentary literacy level
or with mild intellectual disabilities. The articles in
2Par were written by Italian linguists expert in text
simplification using a controlled language both at
the lexicon and sentence structure levels (Piemon-
tese, 1996) .
There are different motivations underlying the se-
lection of these two corpora for our study. On the
practical side, to our knowledge 2Par is the only
available corpus of simplified texts addressing a
wide audience characterised by a low literacy level.
So, the use of 2Par represented the only possible op-
tion on the front of simplified texts. For the selection
of the second corpus we opted for texts belonging
to the same class, i.e. newspapers: this was aimed
at avoiding interferences due to textual genre varia-
tion in the measure of text readability. This is con-
firmed by the fact that the two corpora show a sim-
ilar behaviour with respect to a number of different
parameters, which according to the literature on reg-
ister variation (Biber, 2009) are indicative of textual
genre differences: e.g. lexical density, the noun/verb
ratio, the percentage of verbal roots, etc. On the
other hand, the two corpora differ significantly with
respect to the distribution of features typically cor-
related with text complexity, e.g. the composition of
the used vocabulary (e.g. the percentage of words
belonging to the Basic Italian Vocabulary in Rep is
4.14% and in 2Par is 48.04%) or, from the syntactic
point of view, the average parse tree height (which in
Rep is 5.71 and in 2Par 3.67), the average number of
verb phrases per sentence (which in Rep is 2.40 and
in 2Par 1.25), the depth of nested structures (e.g. the
average depth of embedded complement ?chains? in
Rep is 1.44 and in 2Par is 1.30), the proportion of
main vs subordinate clauses (in Rep main and sub-
ordinate clauses represent respectively 65.11% and
34.88% of the cases; in 2Par there is 79.66% of main
clauses and 20.33% of subordinate clauses).
The Rep/2Par pair of corpora is somehow remi-
niscent of corpora used in other readability studies,
such as Encyclopedia Britannica and Britannica El-
ementary, but with a main difference: whereas the
English corpora consist of paired original/simplified
texts, which we might define as ?parallel monolin-
gual corpora?, the selected Italian corpora rather
present themselves as ?comparable monolingual
corpora?, without any pairing of the full?simplified
versions of the same article. Comparability is guar-
anteed here by the inclusion of texts belonging to the
same textual genre: we expect such comparable cor-
pora to be usefully exploited for readability assess-
ment because of the emphasis on style over topic.
Although these corpora do not provide an ex-
plicit grade?level ranking for each article, broad
categories are distinguished, namely easy?to?read
vs difficult?to?read texts. The two paired com-
plex/simplified corpora were used to train and test
different language models described in Section 6.
As already pointed out, such a distinction is reliable
in a document classification scenario, while at the
sentence classification level it poses the remarkable
issue of discerning easy?to?read sentences within
difficult?to?read documents (i.e. Rep).
6 Experiments and Results
READ?IT was tested on the 2Par and Rep cor-
pora automatically POS tagged by the Part?Of?
Speech tagger described in Dell?Orletta (2009) and
dependency?parsed by the DeSR parser (Attardi,
2006) using Support Vector Machine as learning al-
gorithm. Three different sets of experiments were
devised to test the performance of READ-IT in the
following subtasks: i) document readability classifi-
cation, ii) sentence readability classification and iii)
detection of easy?to?read sentences within difficult?
78
to?read texts.
For what concerns the document classification
subtask, we used a corpus made up of 638 docu-
ments of which 319 were extracted from 2Par (taken
as representative of the class easy?to?read texts) and
319 from Rep (representing the class of difficult?
to?read texts). We have followed a 5?fold cross?
validation process: the corpus was randomly split
into 5 training and test sets. The test sets consisted
of 20% of the individual documents belonging to the
two considered readability levels, with each docu-
ment being included in one test set only. With re-
gard to the sentence classification subtask, we used a
training set of about 3,000 sentences extracted from
2Par and of about 3,000 sentences from Rep and a
test corpus of 1,000 sentences of which 500 were ex-
tracted from 2Par (hereafter, 2Par test set) and 500
from Rep (hereafter, Rep test set). In the third ex-
periment, readability assessment was carried out by
READ?IT with respect to a much bigger corpus of
2,5 milion of words extracted from the newspaper
La Repubblica (hereafter, Rep 2.5), for a total of
123,171 sentences, with the final aim of detecting
easy?to?read sentences.
All the experiments were carried out using four
different readability models, described as follows:
1. Base Model, using raw text features only;
2. Lexical Model, using a combination of raw
text and lexical features;
3. MorphoS Model: using raw text, lexical and
morpho?syntactic features;
4. Syntax Model: combining all feature types,
namely raw text, lexical, morpho?syntactic and
syntactic features.
Note that in the Lexical and Syntax Models, dif-
ferent sets of features were selected for the subtasks
of document and sentence classification. In particu-
lar, for sentence?based readability assesment we did
not take into account the Type/Token Ratio feature,
all features concerning the distribution of ?chains?
of embedded complements and subordinate clauses
and the distribution of verbal predicates by arity.
Since, to our knowledge, a machine learning read-
ability classifier does not exist for the Italian lan-
guage we consider the Base Model as our baseline:
this can be seen as an approximation of the Gul-
pEase index, which is based on the same raw text
features (i.e. sentence and word length).
6.1 Evaluation Methodology
Different evaluation methods have been defined in
order to assess achieved results in the three afore-
mentioned experiment sets. The performance of
both document and sentence classification experi-
ments have been evaluated in terms of i) overall Ac-
curacy of the system and ii) Precision and Recall.
In particular, Accuracy is a global score referring
to the percentage of documents or sentences cor-
rectly classified, either as easy?to?read or difficult?
to?read objects. Precision and Recall have been
computed with respect to two the target reading lev-
els: in particular, Precision is the ratio of the number
of correctly classified documents or sentences over
the total number of documents and sentences classi-
fied by READ?IT as belonging to the easy?to?read
(i.e. 2Par) or difficult?to?read (i.e. Rep) classes; Re-
call has been computed as the ratio of the number of
correctly classified documents or sentences over the
total number of documents or sentences belonging
to each reading level in the test sets. For each set of
experiments, evaluation was carried out with respect
to the four models of the classifier.
Following from the assumption that 2Par con-
tains only easy?to?read sentences while Rep does
not necessarily contain only difficult?to?read ones,
we consider READ?IT errors in the classification of
2Par sentences as erroneously classified sentences.
On the other hand, classification errors within the
set of Rep sentences deserve an in?depth error anal-
ysis, since we need to discern real errors from mis-
classifications due to the fact that we are in front of
easy?to?read sentences occurring in a difficult?to?
read context. In order discern errors from ?correct?
misclassifications, we introduced a new evaluation
methodology, based on the notion of Euclidean dis-
tance between feature vectors. Each feature vec-
tor is a n?dimensional vector of linguistic features
(see Section 4.1) that represents a set of sentences.
Two vectors with 0 distance represent the same set
of sentences, i.e. those sentences sharing the same
values for the monitored linguistic features. Con-
versely, the bigger the distance between two vectors
is, the more distant are the two represented sets of
79
sentences with respect to the monitored features.
The same notion of distance has also been used
to test which model was more effective in predicting
the readability of n?word long sentences.
6.2 Results
In Table 1, the Accuracy, Precision and Recall scores
achieved with the different READ?IT models in the
document classification subtask are reported. It can
be noticed that the Base Model shows the lowest per-
formance, while the MorphoS Model outperforms
all other models. Interestingly, the Lexical Model
shows a high accuracy for what concerns the doc-
ument classification subtask (95.45%), by signifi-
cantly improving the accuracy score of the Base
Model (about +19%). This result demonstrates that
for assessing the readability of documents a combi-
nation of raw and lexical features provides reliable
results which can be further improved (about +3%)
by also taking into account morpho-syntax.

Table 1: Document classification results
Consider now the sentence classification subtask.
Table 2 shows that in this case the most reliable re-
sults are achieved with the Syntax Model. It is inter-
esting to note that the morpho?syntactic and syntac-
tic features allow a much higher increment in terms
of Accuracy, Precision and Recall scores than in the
document classification scenario: i.e. the difference
between the performance of the Lexical Model and
the best one in the document classification experi-
ment (i.e. the MorphoS Model) is equal to 2.6%,
while in the sentence classification case (i.e. Syntax
Model) is much higher, namely 17% .
In Table 3, we detail the performance of the best
READ?IT model (i.e. the Syntax Model) on the
Rep test set. In order to evaluate those sentences
which were erroneously classified as belonging to
2Par, we calculated the distance between 2Par and i)
these sentences (140 sentences referred to as wrong
in the Table), ii) the correctly classified sentences

Table 2: Sentence classification results
(360 sentences, referred to as correct in the Table),
iii) the whole Rep test set. As we can see, the dis-
tance between the wrong sentences and 2Par is much
lower than the distance holding between 2Par and
the correcly classified sentences (correct). This en-
tails that the sentences which were erroneously clas-
sified as easy?to?read sentences (i.e. belonging to
2Par) are in fact more readable than the correctly
classified ones (as belonging to Rep).It is obvious
that the Rep test set, which contains both correct and
wrong sentences, has an intermediate distance value
with respect to 2Par.

Table 3: Distances between 2Par and Rep on the basis of
the Syntax Model
In Table 4, the percentage of Rep 2.5 sentences
classified as difficult?to?read is reported. The re-
sults show that the Syntax Model classifies the higher
number of sentences as difficult?to?read, but from
these results we cannot say whether this model is the
best one or not since Rep 2.5 sentences are not anno-
tated with readability information. Therefore, in or-
der to compare the performance of the four READ?
IT models and to identify which is the best one, we
computed the distance between the sentences clas-
sified as easy?to?read and 2Par, which is reported,
for each model, in Table 5. It can be noticed that
the Syntax Model appears to be the best one since it
shows the lowest distance with respect to 2Par; on
the other hand, the whole Rep 2.5 corpus shows a
higher distance since it contains both difficult? and
easy?to?read sentences. Obviously, the sentences
classified as difficult?to?read by the Syntax Model
(Diff Syntax in the Table) show the broader distance.

In order to gain an in?depth insight into the
different behaviour of the four READ?IT models,
we evaluated their performances for sentences of a
fixed length. We considered sentences whose length
ranges between 8 and 30. For every set of sentences
of the same legth, we compared the easy?to-read
sentences of Rep 2.5 classified by the four models
with respect to 2Par. In Figure 1, each point rep-
resents the distance between a set of sentences of
the same length and the same n?word long set of
sentences in the 2Par corpus. As it can be seen, the
bottom line which represents the sentences classified
as easy?to?read by the Syntax Model is the closest
to the 2Par sentences of the same length. On the
contrary, the line representing the sentences classi-
fied by the Base Model is the most distant amongst
the four READ?IT models. Interestingly, it over-
laps with the line representing the Rep 2.5 sentences:
this suggests that a classification model based only
on raw text features (i.e. sentence and word length)
is not able to identify easy?to?read sentences if we
consider sets of sentences of a fixed length. Obvi-
ously, the line representing the sentences classified
as difficult?to?read by the Syntax Model shows the
broadest distance. This experiment has shown that
linguistically motivated features (and in particular
syntactic ones) have a fundamental role in the sen-
tence readability assessment subtask.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new approach to read-
ability assessment with a specific view to the task of
text simplification: the intended audience includes
people with low literacy skills and/or with mild cog-
nitive impairment. The main contributions of this
work can be summarised as follows: i) READ?
IT represents the first advanced readability assess-
ment tool for what concerns Italian; ii) it combines
traditional raw text features with lexical, morpho-
syntactic and syntactic information; iii) readability
assessment is carried out with respect to both doc-
uments and sentences. Sentence?based readability
assessment is an important novelty of our approach
which creates the prerequisites for aligning readabil-
ity assessment with text simplification. READ?IT
shows a high accuracy in the document classification
task and promising results in the sentence classifica-
tion scenario. The two different tasks appear to en-
force different requirements at the level of the under-
lying linguistic features. To overcome the lack of an
Italian reference resource annotated with readability
information at the sentence level we introduced the
notion of distance to assess READ?IT performance.

Abstract
In this paper, we describe our approach to na-
tive language identification and discuss the re-
sults we submitted as participants to the First
NLI Shared Task. By resorting to a wide set of
general?purpose features qualifying the lexi-
cal and grammatical structure of a text, rather
than to ad hoc features specifically selected
for the NLI task, we achieved encouraging re-
sults, which show that the proposed approach
is general?purpose and portable across differ-
ent tasks, domains and languages.
1 Introduction
Since the seminal work by Koppel et al (2005),
within the Computational Linguistics community
there has been a growing interest in the NLP?based
Native Language Identification (henceforth, NLI)
task. However, so far, due to the unavailability
of balanced and wide?coverage benchmark corpora
and the lack of evaluation standards it has been dif-
ficult to compare the results achieved for this task
with different methods and techniques (Tetreault et
al., 2013). The First Shared Task on Native Lan-
guage Identification (Tetreault et al, 2013) can be
seen as an answer to the above mentioned problems.
In this paper, we describe our approach to na-
tive language identification and discuss the results
we submitted as participants to the First NLI Shared
Task. Following the guidelines by the Shared Task
Organizers based on the previous literature on this
topic, Native Language Identification is tackled as
a text classification task combining NLP?enabled
feature extraction and machine learning: see e.g.
Tetreault et al (2013) and Brooke and Hirst (2012).
Interestingly, the same methodological paradigm is
shared by other tasks like e.g. author recognition and
verification (see e.g. van Halteren (2004), author-
ship attribution (see Juola (2008) for a survey), genre
identification (Mehler et al, 2011) as well as read-
ability assessment (see Dell?Orletta et al (2011a) for
an updated survey), all relying on feature extraction
from automatically parsed texts and state?of?the?art
machine learning algorithms. Besides obvious dif-
ferences at the level of the typology of selected lin-
guistic features and of learning techniques, these dif-
ferent tasks share a common approach to the prob-
lems they tackle: i.e. they succeed in determining
the language variety, the author, the text genre or the
level of readability of a text by exploiting the distri-
bution of different types of linguistic features auto-
matically extracted from texts.
Our approach to NLI relies on multi?level lin-
guistic analysis, covering morpho?syntactic tagging
and dependency parsing. In the NLI literature, the
range of features used is wide and includes char-
acteristics of the linguistic structure underlying the
L2 text, encoded in terms of sequences of charac-
ters, words, grammatical categories or of syntac-
tic constructions, as well as of the document struc-
ture: note however that, in most part of the cases,
the exploited features are task?specific. In our ap-
proach, we decided to resort to a wide set of fea-
tures ranging across different levels of linguistic de-
scription (i.e. lexical, morpho?syntactic and syntac-
tic) without any a priori selection: the same set of
features was successfully exploited in NLI?related
tasks, i.e. focusing on the linguistic form rather than
207
the content of texts, such as readability assessment
(Dell?Orletta et al, 2011a) or the classification of
textual genres (Dell?Orletta et al, 2012).
The exploitation of general features qualifying the
lexical and grammatical structure of a text, rather
than ad hoc features specifically selected for the task
at hand, is not the only peculiarity of our approach
to NLI. Following Biber (1993), we start from the
assumption that ?linguistic features from all levels
function together as underlying dimensions of vari-
ation?. This choice stems from studies on linguis-
tic variation, in particular from Biber and Conrad
(2009) who claim that linguistic varieties ? called
?registers? from a functional perspective ? differ ?in
their characteristic distributions of pervasive linguis-
tic features, not the single occurrence of an indi-
vidual feature?. This is to say that by carrying out
the linguistic analysis of collections of essays each
written by different L1 native speakers, we need to
quantify the extent to which a given feature occurs
in each collection, in order to reconstruct the lin-
guistic profile underlying each L1 collection: dif-
ferences lie at the level of the distribution of linguis-
tic features, which can be common and pervasive in
some L1 collections but comparatively rare in oth-
ers. This approach is the basis of so?called ?linguis-
tic profiling? of texts, within which ?the occurrences
of a large number of linguistic features in a text, ei-
ther individual items or combinations of items, are
counted? (van Halteren, 2004) with the final aim of
reconstructing the profile of a text.
We carried out native language identification in
two steps. The first step consisted of the identifi-
cation of the set of linguistic features characteriz-
ing the essays written by different L1 native speak-
ers, i.e. the linguistic profiling of the different sec-
tions of TOEFL11 corpus (Blanchard et al, 2013)
distributed as training and development data. In
the second step, the features which turned out to
have highly discriminative power were used for the
classification of essays written by different L1 na-
tive speakers. Essay classification has been carried
out by experimenting with different approaches: i.e.
a single?classifier method and two different multi?
model ensemble approaches.
The paper is organised as follows: after introduc-
ing the set of used linguistic features (Section 2),
Section 3 illustrates a selection of the linguistic
profiling results obtained with respect to the train-
ing section of the TOEFL11 corpus; Section 4 de-
scribes the different classification approaches we
followed and the feature selection process; in Sec-
tion 5 achieved results are reported and discussed.
2 Features
In this study, we focused on a wide set of features
ranging across different levels of linguistic descrip-
tion. Differing from previous work on NLI, no a
priori selection of features was carried out. Instead
of focusing on particular classes of errors or on dif-
ferent types of stylistic idiosyncrasies, we took into
account a wide range of features which are typically
used in studies focusing on the ?form? of a text,
e.g. on issues of genre, style, authorship or read-
ability. As previously pointed out, this represents a
peculiarity of our approach. This choice makes the
selected features language?independent, domain?
independent and reusable across different types of
tasks, as empirically demonstrated in Dell?Orletta
et al (2011a) where the same set of features has
been successfully exploited for readability assess-
ment, and in Dell?Orletta et al (2012) where the fea-
tures have been used for the classification of differ-
ent types of textual genre. Note that in both cases the
language dealt with was Italian: for the NLI Shared
Task we had to specialize the feature extraction pro-
cess with respect to the English language as well as
to the annotation scheme used to represent the un-
derlying linguistic structure.
The whole set of features we started with is de-
scribed below, organised into four main categories:
namely, raw text and lexical features as well as
morpho-syntactic and syntactic features. This pro-
posed four?fold partition closely follows the differ-
ent levels of linguistic analysis automatically car-
ried out on the text being evaluated, i.e. tokeniza-
tion, lemmatization, morpho-syntactic tagging and
dependency parsing.
2.1 Raw and Lexical Text Features
Sentence Length, calculated as the average number
of words per sentence.
Word Length, calculated as the average number of
characters per word.
Document Length, calculated as the total number
208
of words per document.
Character bigrams.
Word n-grams, including both unigrams and bi-
grams.
Type/Token Ratio: the Type/Token Ratio (TTR) is
a measure of vocabulary variation which has shown
to be a helpful measure of lexical variety within
a text as well as style marker in an authorship at-
tribution scenario: a text characterized by a low
type/token ratio will contain a great deal of repeti-
tion whereas a high type/token ratio reflects vocabu-
lary richness and variation. Due to its sensitivity to
sample size, TTR has been computed for text sam-
ples of equivalent length (the first 50 tokens).
2.2 Morpho?syntactic Features
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech n-grams: distri-
bution of unigrams and bigrams of coarse?grained
PoS, corresponding to the main grammatical cate-
gories (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
Fine grained Part-Of-Speech n-grams: distribu-
tion of unigrams and bigrams of fine?grained PoS,
which represent subdivisions of the coarse?grained
tags (e.g. the class of nouns is subdivided into proper
vs common nouns, verbs into main verbs, gerund
forms, past particles, etc.).
Verbal chunks: distribution of sequences of verbal
PoS (also including adverbs). This feature can be
seen as a proxy to capture different aspects of verbal
predication, with particular attention to idiosyncratic
usages of verbal mood, tense, person and adverbial
modification.
Lexical density: ratio of content words (verbs,
nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the total number
of lexical tokens in a text.
2.3 Syntactic Features
Dependency types n-grams: distribution of uni-
grams and bigrams of dependency types calculated
with respect to i) the hierarchical parse tree structure
and ii) the surface linear ordering of words.
Dependency triples: distribution of triplets repre-
senting a dependency relation consisting of a syn-
tactic head (h), the dependency relation type (t) and
the dependent (d). Two different variants of this fea-
ture are distinguished, based on the fact that either
the coarse?grained PoS or the word?form of h and d
is considered: we will refer to the former as Coarse
grained Part-Of-Speech dependency triples and to
the latter as Lexical dependency triples. In both
cases, the relative ordering of h and d, i.e. whether h
precedes or follows d at the level of the linear order-
ing of words within the sentence, is also considered.
Dependency Subtrees: distribution of dependency
subtrees consisting of a dependency relation (repre-
sented as the dependency triple {h, t, d}), the head
father and the dependency relation linking the two.
As in the previous case, two different variants of this
feature are distinguished, based on the fact that ei-
ther the coarse grained PoS or the word?forms of
the nodes in the dependency subtree are considered.
Parse tree depth features: this set of features is
meant to capture different aspects of the parse tree
depth and includes: a) the depth of the whole parse
tree, calculated in terms of the longest path from
the root of the dependency tree to some leaf; b)
the average depth of embedded complement ?chains?
governed by a nominal head and including either
prepositional complements or nominal and adjecti-
val modifiers; c) the probability distribution of em-
bedded complement ?chains? by depth. These fea-
tures represent reliable indicators of sentence com-
plexity, as stated by, among others, Yngve (1960),
Frazier (1985) and Gibson (1998), and they can thus
allow capturing specific difficulties of L2 learners.
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech of sentence root:
this feature refers to coarse grained POS of the syn-
tactic root of a sentence.
Arity of verbal predicates: this feature refers to
the number of dependencies (corresponding to either
subcategorized arguments or modifiers) governed by
the same verbal head. In the NLI context, it can al-
low capturing improper verbal usage by L2 learners
due to language transfer (e.g. with pro?drop lan-
guages as L1).
Subordination features: this set of features is
meant to capture different aspects of the use of sub-
ordination and includes: a) the distribution of sub-
ordinate vs main clauses; b) the average depth of
?chains? of embedded subordinate clauses and c)
the probability distribution of embedded subordinate
clauses ?chains? by depth. Similarly to parse tree
depth, this set of features can be taken to reflect the
structural complexity of sentences and can thus be
indicative of specific difficulties of L2 learners.
Length of dependency links: measured in terms
209
of the words occurring between the syntactic head
and the dependent. This is another feature which
reflects the syntactic complexity of sentences (Lin,
1996; Gibson, 1998) and which can be successfully
exploited to capture syntactic idiosyncracies of L2
learners due to L1 interferences.
2.4 Other features
Two further features have been considered for NLI
purposes, which were included in the distributed
datasets. For each document, we have also consid-
ered i) the English language proficiency level (high,
medium, or low) based on human assessment by lan-
guage specialists, and ii) the topic of the essays.
3 Linguistic Profiling of TOEFL11 Corpus
In this section, we illustrate the results of linguis-
tic profiling carried out on the training and devel-
opment sets extracted from the TOEFL11 corpus.
This corpus, described in Blanchard et al (2013),
contains 1,100 essays per 11 languages (for a to-
tal of 12,100 essays) sampled as evenly as possi-
ble from 8 prompts (i.e., topics) along with score
levels (low/medium/high) for each essay. The con-
sidered L1s are: Arabic, Chinese, French, German,
Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Telugu,
and Turkish. For the specific purposes of the NLI
Shared Task, a total of 9,900 essays has been dis-
tributed as training data (900 essays per L1), 1,100
as development data (100 per L1) and the remaining
1,100 essays have been used as test data.
We started from the automatic linguistic annota-
tion of training and development data whose output
has been searched for with respect to the features il-
lustrated in Section 2.
3.1 Linguistic Pre?processing
Both training and development data were au-
tomatically morpho-syntactically tagged by the
POS tagger described in Dell?Orletta (2009) and
dependency?parsed by the DeSR parser using
Multi?Layer Perceptron as learning algorithm (At-
tardi et al, 2009), a state?of?the?art linear?time
Shift?Reduce dependency parser. Feature extraction
is carried out against the output of the multi?level
automatic linguistic analysis carried out during the
pre?processing stage: lexical and grammatical pat-
terns corresponding to the wide typology of selected
features are looked for within each annotation layer
and quantified.
3.2 Linguistic Profiling
Generally speaking, linguistic profiling makes it
possible to identify (groups of) texts which are sim-
ilar, at least with respect to the ?profiled? features
(van Halteren, 2004). In what follows we report
the results of linguistic profiling obtained with re-
spect to the 11 L1 sub?corpora considered in this
study. Figure 1 shows the results obtained with re-
spect to a selection of the features described in Sec-
tion 2. These results refer to the combined training
and development data sets: note, however, that we
also calculated the values of these features in the two
datasets separately and it turned out that they do not
vary significantly between the two sets. This fact
can be taken as a proof both of the reliability of our
approach to linguistic profiling and of the relevance
of these features for NLI purposes.
Starting from raw textual features (Figures 1(a)
and 1(b)), both average sentence length and aver-
age word length vary significantly across L1s. In
particular, if on the one hand the essays written by
Arabic and Spanish L1 speakers contain the shortest
words and the longest sentences, on the other hand
the Hindi and Telugu L1 essays are characterized by
the longest words; the L1 Japanese and Korean cor-
pora contain the shortest sentences.
Let us focus now on the distribution of unigrams
of coarse grained Parts?Of?Speech. If we consider
the distributions of determiners and nouns, two fea-
tures typically used for NLI purposes (Wong and
Dras, 2009) which also represent stylistic markers
associated with different linguistic varieties (Biber
and Conrad, 2009), it can be noticed (see Fig-
ures 1(c) and 1(d)) that for Japanese and Korean the
essays show the lowest percentage of determiners,
while for Hindi and Telugu they are characterized
by the highest percentage of nouns.
For what concerns syntactic features, we observe
that essays by Japanese and Korean speakers are
characterized by quite a different distribution with
respect to the other L1 corpora. In particular, they
show the shallowest parse trees, the shortest depen-
dency links as well as the shortest ?chains? of em-
bedded complements governed by a nominal head.
On the other hand, the essays by Spanish and Ara-
210
(a) Average word length (b) Average sentence length
(c) Distribution of Determiners (d) Distribution of Nouns
(e) Average parse tree depth (f) Average depth of embedded complement ?chains?
(g) Average length of the longest dependency link (h) Arity of verbal predicates

corpus.
211
bic speakers contain the deepest parse trees, for Ital-
ian and Spanish we observe the longest dependency
links and for Hindi and Telugu the longest sequences
of embedded complements. Moreover, while the
essays by Italians are characterised by the highest
value of arity of verbal predicates, for Hindi, Telugu
and Korean essays much lower values are recorded.
Interestingly, these linguistic profiling results
show similar trends across the 11 languages at dif-
ferent levels of linguistic analysis. For instance, it
can be noted that Japanese and Korean or Italian
and Spanish, which belong to two different language
families, show similar distributions of features. Sim-
ilarities have also been recorded in the sub?corpora
by Hindi and Telugu speakers, even if these lan-
guages do not belong to the same family; we can
hypothesize that this might originate from language
contact phenomena.
4 System Description
4.1 Machine Learning Classifier
Our approach to Native Language Identification has
been implemented in a software prototype, i.e. a
classifier operating on mopho?syntactically tagged
and dependency parsed texts which assigns to each
document a score expressing its probability of be-
longing to a given L1 class. The highest score rep-
resents to the most probable class. Given a set of
features and a training corpus, the classifier creates a
statistical model using the feature statistics extracted
from the training corpus. This model is used in the
classification of unseen documents. The set of fea-
tures and the machine learning algorithm can be pa-
rameterized through a configuration file.
For each feature, we have implemented three dif-
ferent variants, depending on whether the feature
value is encoded in terms of: i ) presence/absence
of the feature (binary variant), ii ) the normalized
frequency (normalized frequency variant), and iii )
the normalized tf*idf value (normalized tf*idf vari-
ant). Since the binary feature variant outperformed
the other two, in all the experiments carried out on
the development set reported in Section 5 we illus-
trate the results obtained using this variant only. This
is in line with the results obtained by Brooke and
Hirst (2012) and Tetreault et al (2013). According
to (Brooke and Hirst, 2012), a possible explanation
is that ?in these relatively short texts, there is high
variability in normalized frequencies, and a simpler
metric, by having less variability, is easier for the
classifier to leverage?. Support Vector Machines
(SVM) using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) and
Maximum Entropy (ME) using MaxEnt1 have been
used as machine learning algorithms.
We experimented two classification approaches: a
single classifier method and two ensemble systems,
combining the output of several classifiers.
The single classifier uses the set of features re-
sulting from the feature selection process described
in Section 4.2 and the SVM using linear kernel as
machine learning algorithm. This choice is due to
the fact that in all the experiments the linear SVM
outperformed the SVM using polynomial kernel.
There are two possible explanations for this fact,
namely: a) the number of features is much higher
than the number of training instances, accordingly
it might not be necessary to map data to a higher
dimensional space, therefore the nonlinear mapping
does not improve the performance; b) Weston et al
(2000) showed that SVMs can indeed suffer in high
dimensional spaces where many features are irrele-
vant. Note that in Section 5, we report the results of
this classifier using different sets of features corre-
sponding to the lexical, morpho?syntactic and syn-
tactic levels of linguistic analysis.
The two ensemble systems combine the outputs
of the component classifiers following two different
strategies. The first one is based on the majority vot-
ing method (henceforth, VoteComb ): the combina-
tion strategy is seen as a classical voting problem
where for each essay is assigned the L1 class that
has been selected from the majority of classifiers. In
case of ties, the L1 class predicted from the best indi-
vidual model (as resulting from the experiments car-
ried out on the development set) is selected. The sec-
ond strategy combines the outputs of the component
classifiers via another classifier (henceforth referred
to as meta?classifier): we will refer to this second
strategy as ClassComb. The meta?classifier uses as
a feature the probability score predicted from each
component classifier for each L1 class. Differently
from the component classifiers, the meta?classifier
is based on polynomial kernel SVM. In both en-

semble systems, the component classifiers use linear
SVM and ME as machine learning algorithms and
exploit different sets of features among the ones re-
sulting from the feature selection process described
below.
4.2 Features Selection Process
Since our approach to NLI relies on a wide num-
ber of general?purpose features, a feature selection
process was necessary in order to prune irrelevant
and redundant features which could negatively af-
fect the classification results. The selection process
starts taking into account all the n features described
in Section 2. In each iteration, for each feature fi we
generate a configuration ci such that fi is disabled
and all the other features are enabled. When an it-
eration finishes, we obtain for each ci a correspond-
ing accuracy score score(ci) which is computed as
the average of the accuracy obtained by the classi-
fier on the development set (ad) and on an internal
development set (ai), corresponding to the 10% of
the training set, used in order to reduce the overfit-
ting risk. Being cb the best configuration among all
the ci configurations, if score(cb) ? of the accuracy
scores resulting from the previous iterations the pro-
cess stops. Otherwise:
1. store in F the pair ?fb, disabled? ;
2. for each configuration ci, if score(ci) ? of the
accuracy scores resulting from the previous it-
erations, we store in F the pair ?fi, enabled?;
3. set C = ?cb, score(cb)?
where F is a map containing elements
feature ? {disabled, enabled} and C is a
pair that contains the current best configuration cb
and the corresponding score score(cb). In each
iteration, we consider only the features which do
not occur in F . At the initialization step F is empty
and C contains the configuration where all the
considered features are enabled.
In spite of the fact that the described selection
process does not guarantee to obtain the global opti-
mum, it however permitted us to obtain an improve-
ment of about 8% with respect to the starting model
indiscriminately using all features.
Table 1 lists the features resulting from the fea-
ture selection process. It can be noted that some
Lexical features:
Word n-grams
Morpho?syntactic features:
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech unigrams
Fine grained Part-Of-Speech bigrams
Syntactic features:
Dependency types unigrams
Lexical dependency triples
Parse tree depth features
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech of sentence root
Arity of verbal predicates
Subordination features
Length of dependency links
Table 1: Features resulting from the feature selection pro-
cess.
of them coincide with those typically used for NLI
purposes: this is the case of n?grams of words,
Parts-Of-Speech and syntactic dependencies. Inter-
estingly, to our knowledge, other features such as ar-
ity of verbal predicates, length of dependency links
as well as subordination and parse tree depth fea-
tures have not been used for NLI so far, in spite of
their being widely exploited in the syntactic com-
plexity literature (as discussed in Section 2).
5 Results
Table 2 reports the overall Accuracy achieved with
the different classifier models in the NLI classifi-
cation task on the official test set as well as the
F-measure score recorded for each L1 class. The
first two lines show the accuracies of the two com-
bination models, while the last three report the re-
sults obtained by the single classifier using i) the set
of features resulting by the features selection pro-
cess (Best Single), ii) the selected lexical features
only (see Table 1) (Lexical ) and iii) the lexical and
morpho?syntactic features (Lex+Morph ).
The two combination models outperform all
the single model classifiers: note that ClassComb
achieved much better results with respect to Vote-
Comb. By comparing these results with the F-
measure scores obtained on the distributed develop-
ment data (see Table 3), it can be seen that the rank-
ing of the scores achieved by the different classifiers
remains the same even if on the test data we obtained
a performance of -2,2% with respect to the develop-

Let us consider now the results obtained by the
single model classifiers. In all cases the Best Single
outperforms the other two models demonstrating the
reliability of the features selection process and that
a combination of lexical, morpho?syntactic and syn-
tactic features leads to better results.
Although the best performing model is the Class-

Table 2, the best results for each L1 are bolded. In-
terestingly, even though Lexical is the worst model,
it is the best performing one for three L1s while the
best model, i.e. ClassComb, for five only.
It can be noted that with respect to the devel-
opment data set the syntactic features used by the
Best Single model allow an increment of +1% as
opposed to the Lexical model: this represents a
much higher increase if compared with the result
obtained on the test data, which is +0,4%. This is
an unexpected result since the feature selection de-
scribed in Section 4.2 was carried out on an internal
development set in order to prevent the risk of over-
fitting on the distributed development data.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we reported our participation results
to the First Native Language Identification Shared
Task. By resorting to a wide set of general?
purpose features qualifying the lexical and grammat-
ical structure of a text, rather than to ad hoc fea-
tures specifically selected for the task at hand, we
achieved encouraging results. After a feature se-
lection process, new features which to our knowl-
edge have never been exploited so far for NLI pur-
poses turned out to contribute significantly to the
task. Interestingly, the same set of features we
started from has been previously successfully ex-
ploited in other related tasks, such as readability
assessment and genre classification, operating on
the Italian language. The obtained results suggest
that our approach is general?purpose and portable
across different domains and languages. Further di-
rections of research currently include: i) comparison
of results obtained with general purpose features and
with NLI?specific features (e.g. typical errors or dif-
ferent types of stylistic idiosyncrasies specific to L2
learners), with a view to combining them to achieve
better results; ii) design and development of new en-
semble classification methods as well as new fea-
ture selection methods considering not only classes
of features but also individual features; iii) testing
our approach to NLI on different L2s (e.g. Italian) .

Abstract
In this paper, a new self?training method
for domain adaptation is illustrated, where
the selection of reliable parses is car-
ried out by an unsupervised linguistically?
driven algorithm, ULISSE. The method
has been tested on biomedical texts with
results showing a significant improve-
ment with respect to considered baselines,
which demonstrates its ability to capture
both reliability of parses and domain?
specificity of linguistic constructions.
1 Introduction
As firstly demonstrated by (Gildea, 2001), pars-
ing systems have a drop of accuracy when tested
against domain corpora outside of the data from
which they were trained. This is a real prob-
lem in the biomedical domain where, due to the
rapidly expanding body of biomedical literature,
the need for increasingly sophisticated and effi-
cient biomedical text mining systems is becom-
ing more and more pressing. In particular, the ex-
istence of natural language parsers reliably deal-
ing with biomedical texts represents the prerequi-
ste for identifying and extracting knowledge em-
bedded in them. Over the last years, this prob-
lem has been tackled within the biomedical NLP
community from different perspectives. The de-
velopment of a domain?specific annotated corpus,
i.e. the Genia Treebank (Tateisi, Yakushiji, Ohta,
& Tsujii, 2005), played a key role by providing a
sound basis for empirical performance evaluation
as well as training of parsers. On the other hand,
several attempts have been made to adapt general
parsers to the biomedical domain. First experi-
ments in this direction are reported in (Clegg &
Shepherd, 2005) who first compared the perfor-
mance of three different parsers against the Ge-
nia treebank and a sample of the Penn Treebank
(PTB) (Mitchell P. Marcus & Santorini, 1993) in
order to carry out an inter?domain analysis of
the typology of errors made by each parser and
demonstrated that by integrating the output of the
three parsers they achieved statistically significant
performance gains. Three different methods of
parser adaptation for the biomedical domain have
been proposed by (Lease & Charniak, 2005) who,
starting from the results of unknown word rate
experiments carried out on the Genia treebank,
adapted a PTB?trained parser by improving the
Part?Of?Speech tagging accuracy and by relying
on an external domain?specific lexicon. More re-
cently, (McClosky, Charniak, & Johnson, 2010)
and (Plank & van Noord, 2011) devised adaptation
methods based on domain similarity measures. In
particular, both of them adopted lexical similar-
ity measures to automatically select from an anno-
tated collection of texts those training data which
is more relevant, i.e. lexically closer, to adapt the
parser to the target domain.
A variety of semi?supervised approaches,
where unlabeled data is used in addition to labeled
training data, have been recently proposed in the
literature in order to adapt parsing systems to new
domains. Among these approaches, the last few
years have seen a growing interest in self?training
for domain adaptation, i.e. a method for using au-
tomatically annotated data from a target domain
when training supervised models. Self?training
methods proposed so far mainly differ at the level
of the selection of parse trees to be added to the
in?domain gold trees as further training data. De-
pending on whether or not external supervised
classifiers are used to select the parses to be added
to the gold?training set, two types of methods are
envisaged in the literature. The first is the case,
among others, of: (Kawahara & Uchimoto, 2008),
using a machine learning classifier to predict the
reliability of parses on the basis of different fea-
ture types; or (Sagae & Tsujii, 2007), selecting
45
identical analyses for the same sentence within the
output of different parsing models trained on the
same dataset; or (McClosky, Charniak, & John-
son, 2006), using a discriminative reranker against
the output of a n?best generative parser for select-
ing the best parse for each sentence to be used
as further training data. Yet, due to the fact that
several supervised classifiers are resorted to for
improving the base supervised parser, this class
of methods cannot be seen as a genuine istance
of self?training. The second type of methods is
exemplified, among others, by (Reichart & Rap-
poport, 2007) who use the whole set of automat-
ically analyzed sentences, and by (McClosky &
Charniak, 2008) and (Sagae, 2010) who add dif-
ferent amounts of automatically parsed data with-
out any selection strategy. Note that (McClosky
& Charniak, 2008) tested their self?training ap-
proach on the Genia Treebank: they self?trained
a PTB?trained costituency parser using a random
selection of Medline abstracts.
In this paper, we address the second scenario
with a main novelty: we use an unsupervised ap-
proach to select reliable parses from automatically
parsed target domain texts to be combined with the
gold?training set. Two unsupervised algorithms
have been proposed so far in the literature for
selecting reliable parses, namely: PUPA (POS?
based Unsupervised Parse Assessment Algorithm)
(Reichart & Rappoport, 2009) and ULISSE (Un-
supervised LInguiStically?driven Selection of dE-
pendency parses) (Dell?Orletta, Venturi, & Mon-
temagni, 2011). Both algorithms assign a qual-
ity score to each parse tree based on statistics
collected from a large automatically parsed cor-
pus, with a main difference: whereas PUPA oper-
ates on costituency trees and uses statistics about
sequences of part?of?speech tags, ULISSE uses
statistics about linguistic features checked against
dependency?based representations. The self?
training strategy presented in this paper is based
on an augmented version of ULISSE. The reasons
for this choice are twofold: if on the one hand
ULISSE appears to outperform PUPA (namely, a
dependency?based version of PUPA implemented
in (Dell?Orletta et al, 2011)), on the other hand the
linguistically?driven nature of ULISSE makes our
self?training strategy for domain adaptation able
to capture reliable parses which are also represen-
tative of the syntactic peculiarities of the target do-
main.
After introducing the in? and out?domain cor-
pora used in this study (Section 2), we discuss
the results of the multi?level linguistic analysis of
these corpora carried out (Section 3) with a view
to identifying the main features differentiating the
biomedical language from ordinary language. In
Section 4, the algorithm used to select reliable
parses from automatically parsed domain?specific
texts is described. In Section 5 the proposed self?
training method is illustrated, followed by a dis-
cussion of achieved results (Section 6).
2 Corpora
Used domain corpora include i) the two out?
domain datasets used for the ?Domain Adaptation
Track? of the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task (Nivre
et al, 2007) and ii) the dependency?based version
of the Genia Treebank (Tateisi et al, 2005). The
CoNLL 2007 datasets are represented by chemical
(CHEM) and biomedical abstracts (BIO), made of
5,001 tokens (195 sentences) and of 5,017 tokens
(200 sentences) respectively. The dependency?
based version of Genia includes?493k tokens and
?18k sentences which was generated by convert-
ing the PTB version of Genia created by Illes Solt1
using the (Johansson & Nugues, 2007) tool with
the -conll2007 option to produce annotations in
line with the CoNLL 2007 data set2. As unla-
belled data, we used the datasets distributed in the
framework of the CoNLL 2007 Domain Adapta-
tion Track. For CHEM the set of unlabelled data
consists of 10,482,247 tokens (396,128 sentences)
and for BIO of 9,776,890 tokens (375,421 sen-
tences). For the experiments using Genia as test
set, we used the BIO unlabelled data. This was
possible due to the fact that both the Genia Tree-
bank and the BIO dataset consist of biomedical
abstracts extracted (though using different query
terms) from PubMed.com.
As in?domain training data we have used the
CoNLL 2007 dependency?based version of Sec-
tions 2?11 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) par-
tition of the Penn Treebank (PTB), for a total of
447,000 tokens and about 18,600 sentences. For
testing, we used the subset of Section 23 of WSJ
consisting of 5,003 tokens (214 sentences).
All corpora have been morpho?syntactically
tagged and lemmatized by a customized version

3 Linguistic analysis of biomedical
abstrats vs newspaper articles
For the specific concerns of this study, we carried
out a comparative linguistic analysis of four dif-
ferent corpora, taken as representative of ordinary
language and biomedical language. In each case,
we took into account a gold (i.e. manually an-
notated) corpus, and an unlabelled corpus, which
was automatically annotated. By comparing the
results obtained with respect to gold and automat-
ically annotated texts, we intend to demonstrate
the reliability of features extracted from automat-
ically annotated texts. As data representative of
ordinary language we took i) the whole WSJ sec-
tion of the Penn Treebank3 including 39,285,425
tokens (1,625,606 sentences) and ii) the sections
2?11 of the WSJ. For what concerns the biomed-
ical domain, we relied on the Genia Treebank in
order to guarantee comparability of the results of
our linguistic analysis with previous studies car-
ried out on this reference corpus. As automatically
annotated data we used the corpus of biomedical
abstract (BIO) distributed as out?domain dataset
used for the ?Domain Adaptation Track? of the
CoNLL 2007 Shared Task.
In order to get evidence of the differences hold-
ing between the WSJ newspaper articles and the
selected biomedical abstracts, the four corpora
have been compared with respect to a wide typol-
ogy of features (i.e. raw text, lexical, morpho?
syntactic and syntactic). Let us start from raw
text features, in particular from average sen-
tence length (calculated as the average number
of words per sentence): as Figure 1 shows, both
the corpus of automatically parsed newspaper ar-
ticles (WSJ unlab) and the manually annotated
one (WSJ gold) contain shorter sentences with re-
spect to both the automatically parsed biomedi-
cal abstrats (BIO unlab) and the manually anno-
tated ones (Genia gold), a result which is in line

tributed for the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on Dependency
Parsing, domain adaptation track.

and newspaper corpora.
with (Clegg & Shepherd, 2005) findings. When
we focus on the lexical level, BIO unlab and
Genia gold appear to have quite a similar per-
centage of lexical items which is not contained
in WSJ gold (23.13% and 26.14% respectively)
while the out?of?vocabulary rate of WSJ unlab
is much lower, i.e. 8.69%. Similar results were
recorded by (Lease & Charniak, 2005) who report
the unknown word rate for various genres of tec-
nical literature.
Let us focus now on the morpho?syntactic level.
If we consider the distribution of nouns, verbs
and adjectives, three features typically represent-
ing stylistic markers associated with different lin-
guistic varieties (Biber & Conrad, 2009), it can
be noticed (see Figures 2(a) and 2(c)) that the
biomedical abstracts contain a higher percentage
of nouns and adjectives while showing a signif-
icantly lower percentage of verbs (Figure 2(b)).
The syntactic counterpart of the different distri-
bution of morpho?syntactic categories can be ob-
served in Table 1, reporting the percentage distri-
bution of the first ten Parts?of?Speech dependency
triplets occurring in the biomedical and newspaper
corpora: each triplet is described as the sequence
of the PoS of a dependent and a head linked by a
depedency arc, by also considering the PoS of the
head father. It turned out that biomedical abstracts
are characterized by nominal dependency triplets,
e.g. two nouns and a preposition (NN?NN?IN)
or noun, preposition, noun (NN?IN?NN) or ad-
jective, noun and preposition (JJ?NN?IN), which
occur more frequently than verbal triplets, such
as determiner, noun and verb (DT?NN?VBZ) or a
verbal root (.?VBD?ROOT)4. Interestingly, in Ge-
nia gold no verbal triplet occurs within the top ten
triplets, which cover the 21% of the total amount

of triplets occurring in the corpus. By contrast,
the same top ten triplets represent only ?11% in
WSJ gold, testifying the wider variety of syntac-
tic constructions occurring in newspaper articles
with respect to texts of the biomedical domain.
This is also proved by the total amount of differ-
ent PoS dependency triplets occurring in the two
gold datasets, i.e. 7,827 in WSJ gold and 5,064
in Genia gold even though the Genia Treebank is
?50,000?tokens bigger.
Further differences can be observed at a deeper
syntactic level of analysis. This is the case of the
average depth of embedded complement ?chains?
governed by a nominal head. Figure 3(a) shows
that biomedical abstracts are characterized by an
average depth which is higher than the one ob-
served in newspaper articles. A similar trend
can be observed for what concerns the distribu-
tion of ?chains? by depth. In Figure 3(b) shows
that WSJ unlab and WSJ gold ?chains?, on the one
hand, and BIO unlab and Genia gold ?chains?,
on the other hand, overlap. The corpora have
also been compared with respect to i) the av-
erage length of dependency links, measured in
terms of the words occurring between the syntac-
tic head and the dependent (excluding punctua-
tion marks), and ii) the average depth of the whole
parse tree, calculated in terms of the longest path
from the root of the dependency tree to a leaf. In
both cases it can be noted that i) the biomedical
abstracts contain much longer dependency links
than newswire texts (Figure 3(c)) and ii) the av-
erage depth of BIO unlab and Genia gold parse
trees is higher than in the case of the WSJ unlab
and WSJ gold (Figure 3(d)). A further distin-
guishing feature of the biomedical abstracts con-
cerns the average depth of ?chains? of embed-
ded subordinate clauses, calculated here by taking
into account both clausal arguments and comple-
ments linked to a verbal sentence root. As Figure
3(e) shows, both BIO unlab and Genia gold have
shorter ?chains? with respect to the ones contained
in the newspaper articles. Interestingly, a careful
analysis of the distributions by depth of ?chains?
of embedded subordinate clauses shows that the
biomedical abstracts appear to have i) a higher oc-
currence of ?chains? including just one subordinate
clause and ii) a lower percentage of deep ?chains?
with respect to newswire texts. Finally, we com-
pared the two types of corpora with respect to the
distribution of verbal roots. The biomedical ab-
stracts resulted to be characterised by a lower per-
centage of verbal roots with respect to newspaper
articles (see Figure 3(f)). This is in line with the
distribution of verbs as well as of the nominal de-
pendency triplets observed in the biomedical ab-
stracts at the morpho?syntactic level of analysis.
Interestingly, the results obtained with respect
to automatically parsed and manually annotated
data show similar trends for both considered in?
and out?domain corpora, thus demonstrating the
reliability of features monitored against automat-
ically annotated data. In what follows, we will
show how detected linguistic peculiarities can be
exploited in a domain adaptation scenario.
4 Linguistically?driven Unsupervised
Ranking of Parses for Self?training
In the self?training approach illustrated in this pa-
per, the selection of parses from the automatically
annotated target domain dataset is guided by an
augmented version of ULISSE, an unsupervised
linguistically?driven algorithm to select reliable
parses from the output of dependency annotated
texts (Dell?Orletta et al, 2011) which has shown
a good performance for two different languages

(English and Italian) against the output of two su-
pervised parsers (MST, (McDonald, Lerman, &
Pereira, 2006) and DeSR, (Attardi, 2006)) se-
lected for their behavioral differences (McDonald
& Nivre, 2007). ULISSE assigns to each depen-
dency tree a score quantifying its reliability based
on a wide range of linguistic features. After col-
lecting statistics about selected features from a
corpus of automatically parsed sentences, for each
newly parsed sentence ULISSE computes a relia-
bility score using the previously extracted feature
statistics. In its reliability assessment, ULISSE ex-
ploits both global and local features, where global
features (listed in Table 2 and discussed in Sec-
tion 3) are computed with respect to each sen-
tence and averaged over all sentences in the cor-
pus, and the local features with respect to indi-
vidual dependency links and averaged over all of
them. Local features include the plausibility of
a dependency link calculated by considering se-
lected features of the dependent and its govern-
ing head as well as of the head father: whereas
in ULISSE the selected features were circum-
scribed to part?of?speech information (so?called
?ArcPOSFeat? feature), in this version of the al-
gorithm a new local feature has been introduced,
named ?ArcLemmaFeat?, which exploits lemma
information. ?ArcPOSFeat? is able to capture the
different distribution of PoS dependency triplets
(see Table 1), along with the type of dependency
link, while the newly introduced ?ArcLemmaFeat?
is meant to capture the lexical peculiarities of the
target domain (see Section 3). As demonstrated
in (Dell?Orletta et al, 2011), both global and lo-
49
cal linguistic features contribute to the selection
of reliable parses. Due to the typology of linguis-
tic features underlying ULISSE, selected reliable
parses typically include domain?specific construc-
tions. This peculiarity of the ULISSE algorithm
turned out to be particularly useful to maximize
the self?training effect in improving the parsing
performance in a domain adaptation scenario.
The reliability score assigned by this augmented
version of ULISSE to newly parsed sentences re-
sults from a combination of the weights associ-
ated with individual features, both global and local
ones. In this study, the reliability score was com-
puted as a simple product of the individual feature
weights: in this way, one low weight feature is suf-
ficient to qualify a parse as low quality and thus to
exclude it from the self?training dataset5.

5 Experimental set?up
In the reported experiments, we used the DeSR
parser. Its performance using the proposed domain
adaptation strategy was tested against i) the two
out?domain datasets distributed for the ?Domain
Adaptation Track? of the CoNLL 2007 Shared
Task and ii) the dependency?based version of the
Genia Treebank, described in Section 2. For test-
ing purposes, we selected from the dependency?
based version of the Genia Treebank sentences
with a maximum length of 39 tokens (for a total
of 375,912 tokens and 15,623 sentences).
Results achieved with respect to the CHEM and
BIO test sets were evaluated in terms of ?Labelled
Attachment Score? (LAS), whereas for Genia the
only possible evaluation was in terms of ?Un-
labelled Attachment Score? (UAS). This follows
from the fact that, as reported by Illes, this ver-
sion of Genia is annotated with a Penn Treebank?
style phrase?structure, where a number of func-
tional tags are missing: this influences the type

of evaluation which can be carried out against the
Genia test set.
Achieved results were compared with two base-
lines, represented by: i) the Baseline model
(BASE), i.e. the parsing model trained on the PTB
training set only; ii) the Random Selection (RS) of
parses from automatically parsed out?domain cor-
pora, calculated as the mean of a 10?fold cross?
validation process. As proved by (Sagae, 2010)
and by (McClosky & Charniak, 2008) for the
biomedical domain, the latter represents a strong
unsupervised baseline showing a significant accu-
racy improvement which was obtained by adding
incremental amounts of automatically parsed out?
domain data to the training dataset without any se-
lection strategy.
The experiments we carried out to test the ef-
fectiveness of our self?training strategy were or-
ganised as follows. ULISSE and the baseline al-
gorithms were used to produce different rankings
of parses of the unlabelled target domain corpora.
From the top of these rankings different pools of
parses were selected to be used for training. In
particular, two different sets of experiments were
carried out, namely: i) using only automatically
parsed data as training corpus and ii) combining
automatically parsed data with the PTB training
set. For each set of experiments, different amounts
of unlabelled data were used to create the self?
training models.
6 Results
Table 3 reports the results of the BASE model
tested on PTB, CHEM, BIO and GENIA. When
applied without adaptation to the out?domain
CHEM, BIO and GENIA test sets, the BASE pars-
ing model has a drop of about 7.5% of LAS in both
CHEM and BIO cases. For what concerns UAS,
the drop is about 6% for CHEM and about 7% for
BIO and GENIA.
The results of the performed experiments are
shown in Figures 4 and 5, where each plot re-
ports the accuracy scores (LAS and UAS respec-
tively) of the self?trained parser using the ULISSE

algorithm (henceforth, ULISSE?Stp) and of the
baseline models (RS and BASE). The parser ac-
curacy was computed with respect to different
amounts of automatically parsed data which were
used to create the self?trained parsing model. For
this purpose, we considered six different pools of
250k, 450k, 900k, 1000k, 1350k and 1500k to-
kens. Plots are organized by experiment type: i.e.
the results in subfigures 4(a), 4(b) and 5(a) are
achieved by using only automatically parsed data
as training corpus, whereas those reported in the
other subfigures refer to models trained on auto-
matically parsed data combined with PTB. Note
that in all figures the line named best?RS repre-
sents the best RS score for each pool of k tokens in
the 10?fold cross?validation process.
For what concerns BIO and CHEM, in the first
set of experiments ULISSE?Stp turned out to be
the best self?training algorithm: this is always the
case for CHEM (see subfigure 4(a)), whereas for
BIO (see subfigure 4(b)) it outperforms all base-
lines only when pools of tokens >= 900k are
added. When 900k tokens are used, ULISSE?Stp
allows a LAS improvement of 0.81% on CHEM
and of 0.61% on BIO with respect to RS, and
of 0.62% on CHEM and of 0.48% on BIO with
respect to BASE. It is interesting to note that
ULISSE?Stp using only automatically parsed data
for training achieves better results than BASE (us-
ing the PTB gold training set): to our knowledge,
a similar result has never been reported in the lit-
erature. The behaviour is similar also when the
51
experiments are evaluated in terms of UAS6.
The results achieved in the first set of experi-
ments carried out on the GENIA test set (see 5(a))
differ significantly from what we observed for
CHEM and BIO: in this case, the BASE model ap-
pears to outperform all the other algorithms, with
the ULISSE?Stp algorithm being however more
effective than the RS baselines.
Figures 4(c), 4(d) and 5(b) report the results of
the second set of experiments, i.e. those carried
out by also including PTB in the training set. Note
that in these plots the RS+PTB lines represent the
score of the parser models trained on the pools
of tokens used to obtain the best?RS line com-
bined with the PTB gold training set. It can be
observed that the ULISSE?Stp+PTB self?training
model outperforms all baselines for CHEM, BIO
and GENIA for all the different sizes of pools of
selected tokens. For each pool of parsed data, Ta-
ble 4 records the improvement and the error reduc-
tion observed with respect to the BASE model.

BASE reported in terms of LAS for CHEM and
BIO and of UAS for GENIA.
Differently from (Sagae, 2010) (with a
constituency?based parser), in this set of experi-
ments the self?training approach based on random
selection of sentences (i.e. the best?RS+PTB
baseline) doesn?t achieve any improvement with
respect to the BASE model with only minor
exceptions (observed e.g. with 250k and 450k
pools of added tokens for CHEM and with 250k
for GENIA). Moreover, even when the best?RS
LAS is higher than the ULISSE?Stp score (e.g.
in the first pools of k of Figure 4(b)), ULISSE?
Stp+PTB turns out to be more effective than
the best?RS+PTB baseline (Figure 4(d)). These
results may follow from the fact that ULISSE?Stp
is able to capture not only reliable parses but also,
and more significantly here, parses which reflect
the syntactic peculiarities of the target domain.
Table 5 shows the results of the different
ULISSE?Stp+PTB models tested on the PTB test

only the LAS scores since this is the standard evaluation met-
ric for dependency parsing.
set: no LAS improvement is observed with respect
to the results obtained with the BASE model, i.e.
86.09% (see Table 3). This result is in line with
(McClosky et al, 2010) and (Plank & van No-
ord, 2011) who proved that parsers trained on the
union of gold corpora belonging to different do-
mains achieve a lower accuracy with respect to the
same parsers trained on data belonging to a sin-
gle target domain. Last but not least, it should be
noted that the performance of ULISSE?Stp across
the experiments carried out with pools of automat-
ically parsed tokens of different sizes is in line
with the behaviour of the ULISSE ranking algo-
rithm (Dell?Orletta et al, 2011), where increas-
ingly wider top lists of parsed tokens show de-
creasing LAS scores. This helps explaining why
the performance of ULISSE?Stp starts decreasing
after a certain threshold when wider top?lists of
tokens are added to the parser training data.

Conclusion
In this paper we explored a new self?training
method for domain adaptation where the selec-
tion of reliable parses within automatically an-
notated texts is carried out by an unsupervised
linguistically?driven algorithm, ULISSE. Results
achieved for the CoNLL 2007 datasets as well
as for the larger test set represented by GENIA
show a significant improvement with respect to
considered baselines. This demonstrates a two?
fold property of ULISSE, namely its reliablity
and effectiveness both in capturing peculiarities
of biomedical texts, and in selecting high quality
parses. Thanks to these properties the proposed
self?training method is able to improve the parser
performances when tested in an out?domain sce-
nario. The same approach could in principle be
applied to deal with biomedical sub?domain varia-
tion: as reported by (Lippincott, Se?aghdha, & Ko-
rhonen, 2011), biomedical texts belonging to dif-
ferent sub?domains do vary along many linguistic
dimensions, with a potential negative impact on
biomedical NLP tools.

Abstract
PAIS
`
A is a Creative Commons licensed,
large web corpus of contemporary Italian.
We describe the design, harvesting, and
processing steps involved in its creation.
1 Introduction
This paper provides an overview of the PAIS
`
A cor-
pus of Italian web texts and an introductory de-
scription of the motivation, procedures and facili-
ties for its creation and delivery.
Developed within the PAIS
`
A project, the cor-
pus is intended to meet the objective to help over-
come the technological barriers that still prevent
web users from making use of large quantities of
contemporary Italian texts for language and cul-
tural education, by creating a comprehensive and
easily accessible corpus resource of Italian.
The initial motivation of the initiative stemmed
from the awareness that any static repertoire of
digital data, however carefully designed and de-
veloped, is doomed to fast obsolescence, if con-
tents are not freely available for public usage, con-
tinuously updated and checked for quality, incre-
mentally augmented with new texts and annota-
tion metadata for intelligent indexing and brows-
ing. These requirements brought us to design a
resource that was (1) freely available and freely
re-publishable, (2) comprehensively covering con-
temporary common language and cultural content
and (3) enhanced with a rich set of automatically-
annotated linguistic information to enable ad-
vanced querying and retrieving of data. On top

of that, we set out to develop (4) a dedicated in-
terface with a low entry barrier for different target
groups. The end result of this original plan repre-
sents an unprecedented digital language resource
in the Italian scenario.
The main novelty of the PAIS
`
A web corpus is
that it exclusively draws on Creative Commons li-
censed data, provides advanced linguistic annota-
tions with respect to corpora of comparable size
and corpora of web data, and invests in a carefully
designed query interface, targeted at different user
groups. In particular, the integration of richly an-
notated language content with an easily accessible,
user-oriented interface makes PAIS
`
A a unique and
flexible resource for language teaching.

The world wide web, with its inexhaustible
amount of natural language data, has become an
established source for efficiently building large
corpora (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). Tools
are available that make it convenient to bootstrap
corpora from the web based on mere seed term
lists, such as the BootCaT toolkit (Baroni and
Bernardini, 2004). The huge corpora created by
the WaCky project (Baroni et al., 2009) are an ex-
ample of such an approach.
A large number of papers have recently been
published on the harvesting, cleaning and pro-
cessing of web corpora.

criteria laid out in section 1. For these criteria to
be fully met, we had to address a wide variety of
issues covering the entire life-cycle of a digital text
resource, ranging from robust algorithms for web
navigation and harvesting, to adaptive annotation
tools for advanced text indexing and querying and
user-friendly accessing and rendering online inter-
faces customisable for different target groups.
Initially, we targeted a size of 100M tokens, and
planned to automatically annotate the data with
lemma, part-of-speech, structural dependency, and
advanced linguistic information, using and adapt-
ing standard annotation tools (cf. section 4). In-
tegration into a querying environment and a dedi-
cated online interface were planned.
3.2 Licenses
A crucial point when planning to compile a cor-
pus that is free to redistribute without encounter-
ing legal copyright issues is to collect texts that are
in the public domain or at least, have been made
available in a copyleft regime. This is the case
when the author of a certain document decided to
share some rights (copy and/or distribute, adapt
etc.) on her work with the public, in a way that
end users do not need to ask permission to the cre-
ator/owner of the original work. This is possible
by employing licenses other than the traditional
?all right reserved? copyright, i.e. GNU, Creative
Commons etc., which found a wide use especially
on the web. Exploratory studies (Brunello, 2009)
have shown that Creative Commons licenses are
widely employed throughout the web (at least on
the Italian webspace), enough to consider the pos-
sibility to build a large corpus from the web ex-
clusively made of documents released under such
licenses.
In particular, Creative Commons provides five
basic ?baseline rights?: Attribution (BY), Share
Alike (SA), Non Commercial (NC), No Deriva-
tive Works (ND). The licenses themselves are
composed of at least Attribution (which can be
used even alone) plus the other elements, al-
lowing six different combinations:
3
(1) Attribu-
tion (CC BY), (2) Attribution-NonCommercial
3
For detailed descriptions of each license see http://
creativecommons.org/licenses/
(CC BY-NC), (3) Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-
SA), (4) Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND), (5)
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-
NC-SA), and (6) Attribution-NonCommercial-
NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND).
Some combinations are not possible because
certain elements are not compatible, e.g. Share
Alike and No Derivative Works. For our purposes
we decided to discard documents released with the
two licenses containing the No Derivative Works
option, because our corpus is in fact a derivative
work of collected documents.
3.3 The final corpus
The corpus contains approximately 388,000 docu-
ments from 1,067 different websites, for a total of
about 250M tokens. All documents contained in
the PAIS
`
A corpus date back to Sept./Oct. 2010.
The documents come from several web sources
which, at the time of corpus collection, provided
their content under Creative Commons license
(see section 3.2 for details). About 269,000 texts
are from Wikimedia Foundation projects, with
approximately 263,300 pages from Wikipedia,
2380 pages from Wikibooks, 1680 pages from
Wikinews, 740 pages from Wikiversity, 410 pages
from Wikisource, and 390 Wikivoyage pages.
The remaining 119,000 documents come
from guide.supereva.it (ca. 19,000),
italy.indymedia.org (ca. 10,000) and
several blog services from more than another
1,000 different sites (e.g. www.tvblog.it
(9,088 pages), www.motoblog.it (3,300),
www.ecowebnews.it (3,220), and
www.webmasterpoint.org (3,138).
Texts included in PAIS
`
A have an average length
of 683 words, with the longest text
4
counting
66,380 running tokens. A non exhaustive list of
average text lengths by source type is provided in
table 1 by way of illustration.
The corpus has been annotated for lemma, part-
of-speech and dependency information (see sec-
tion 4.2 for details). At the document level, the
corpus contains information on the URL of origin
and a set of descriptive statistics of the text, includ-
ing text length, rate of advanced vocabulary, read-
ability parameters, etc. (see section 4.3). Also,
each document is marked with a unique identifier.

4 Corpus Creation
4.1 Collecting and cleaning web data
The web pages for PAIS
`
A were selected in two
ways: part of the corpus collection was made
through CC-focused web crawling, and another
part through a targeted collection of documents
from specific websites.
4.1.1 Seed-term based harvesting
At the time of corpus collection (2010), we used
the BootCaT toolkit mainly because collecting
URLs could be based on the public Yahoo! search
API
5
, including the option to restrict search to CC-
licensed pages (including the possibility to specify
even the particular licenses). Unfortunately, Ya-
hoo! discontinued the free availability of this API,
and BootCaT?s remaining search engines do not
provide this feature.
An earlier version of the corpus was collected
using the tuple list originally employed to build
itWaC
6
. As we noticed that the use of this list, in
combination with the restriction to CC, biased the
final results (i.e. specific websites occurred very
often as top results) , we provided as input 50,000
medium frequent seed terms from a basic Italian
vocabulary list
7
, in order to get a wider distribu-
tion of search queries, and, ultimately, of texts.
As introduced in section 3.2, we restricted the
selection not just to Creative Commons-licensed

texts, but specifically to those licenses allowing
redistribution: namely, CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC
BY-NC-SA, and CC BY-NC.
Results were downloaded and automatically
cleaned with the KrdWrd system, an environment
for the unified processing of web content (Steger
and Stemle, 2009).
Wrongly CC-tagged pages were eliminated us-
ing a black-list that had been manually populated
following inspection of earlier corpus versions.
4.1.2 Targeted
In September 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation de-
cided to release the content of their wikis under
CC BY-SA
8
, so we decided to download the large
and varied amount of texts made available through
the Italian versions of these websites. This was
done using the Wikipedia Extractor
9
on official
dumps
10
of Wikipedia, Wikinews, Wikisource,
Wikibooks, Wikiversity and Wikivoyage.
4.2 Linguistic annotation and tools
adaptation
The corpus was automatically annotated with
lemma, part-of-speech and dependency infor-
mation, using state-of-the-art annotation tools
for Italian. Part-of-speech tagging was per-
formed with the Part-Of-Speech tagger described
in Dell?Orletta (2009) and dependency-parsed by
the DeSR parser (Attardi et al., 2009), using Mul-
tilayer Perceptron as the learning algorithm. The
systems used the ISST-TANL part-of-speech
11
and dependency tagsets
12
. In particular, the pos-
tagger achieves a performance of 96.34% and
DeSR, trained on the ISST-TANL treebank con-
sisting of articles from newspapers and period-
icals, achieves a performance of 83.38% and
87.71% in terms of LAS (labelled attachment
score) and UAS (unlabelled attachment score) re-
spectively, when tested on texts of the same type.
However, since Gildea (2001), it is widely ac-
knowledged that statistical NLP tools have a drop
of accuracy when tested against corpora differing
from the typology of texts on which they were
trained. This also holds true for PAIS
`
A: it contains

lexical and syntactic structures of non-canonical
languages such as the language of social media,
blogs, forum posts, consumer reviews, etc. As re-
ported in Petrov and McDonald (2012), there are
multiple reasons why parsing the web texts is dif-
ficult: punctuation and capitalization are often in-
consistent, there is a lexical shift due to increased
use of slang and technical jargon, some syntactic
constructions are more frequent in web text than
in newswire, etc.
In order to overcome this problem, two main ty-
pologies of methods and techniques have been de-
veloped: Self-training (McClosky et al., 2006) and
Active Learning (Thompson et al., 1999).
For the specific purpose of the NLP tools adap-
tation to the Italian web texts, we adopted two dif-
ferent strategies for the pos-tagger and the parser.
For what concerns pos-tagging, we used an active
learning approach: given a subset of automatically
pos-tagged sentences of PAIS
`
A, we selected the
ones with the lowest likelihood, where the sen-
tence likelihood was computed as the product of
the probabilities of the assignments of the pos-
tagger for all the tokens. These sentences were
manually revised and added to the training corpus
in order to build a new pos-tagger model incor-
porating some new knowledge from the target do-
main.
For what concerns parsing, we used a self-
training approach to domain adaptation described
in Dell?Orletta et al. (2013), based on ULISSE
(Dell?Orletta et al., 2011). ULISSE is an unsu-
pervised linguistically-driven algorithm to select
reliable parses from a collection of dependency
annotated texts. It assigns to each dependency
tree a score quantifying its reliability based on a
wide range of linguistic features. After collect-
ing statistics about selected features from a cor-
pus of automatically parsed sentences, for each
newly parsed sentence ULISSE computes a reli-
ability score using the previously extracted feature
statistics. From the top of the parses (ranked ac-
cording to their reliability score) different pools of
parses were selected to be used for training. The
new training contains the original training set as
well as the new selected parses which include lex-
ical and syntactic characteristics specific of the tar-
get domain (Italian web texts). The parser trained
on this new training set improves its performance
when tested on the target domain.
We used this domain adaptation approach for
the following three main reasons: a) it is unsuper-
vised (i.e. no need for manually annotated training
data); b) unlike the Active Learning approach used
for pos-tagging, it does not need manual revision
of the automatically parsed samples to be used for
training; c) it was previously tested on Italian texts
with good results (Dell?Orletta et al., 2013).
4.3 Readability analysis of corpus documents
For each corpus document, we calculated several
text statistics indicative of the linguistic complex-
ity, or ?readability? of a text.
The applied measures include, (1) text length in
tokens, that is the number of tokens per text, (2)
sentences per text, that is a sentence count, and (3)
type-token ratio indicated as a percentage value.
In addition, we calculated (4) the advanced vo-
cabulary per text, that is a word count of the text
vocabulary which is not part of the the basic Ital-
ian vocabulary (?vocabolario di base?) for written
texts, as defined by De Mauro (1991)
13
, and (5)
the Gulpease Index (?Indice Gulpease?) (Lucisano
and Piemontese, 1988), which is a measure for the
readability of text that is based on frequency rela-
tions between the number of sentences, words and
letters of a text.
All values are encoded as metadata for the cor-
pus. Via the PAIS
`
A online interface, they can
be employed for filtering documents and building
subcorpora. This facility was implemented with
the principal target group of PAIS
`
A users in mind,
as the selection of language examples according
to their readability level is particularly relevant for
language learning and teaching.
4.4 Attempts at text classification for genre,
topic, and function
Lack of information about the composition of cor-
pora collected from the web using unsupervised
methods is probably one of the major limitations
of current web corpora vis-`a-vis more traditional,
carefully constructed corpora, most notably when
applications to language teaching and learning are
envisaged. This also holds true for PAIS
`
A, es-
13
The advanced vocabulary was calculated on the ba-
sis of a word list consisting of De Mauro?s ?vocabolario
fondamentale? (http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vocabolario_fondamentale) and ?vocabolario
di alto uso? (http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vocabolario_di_alto_uso), together with high
frequent function words not contained in those two lists.
39
pecially for the harvested
14
subcorpus that was
downloaded as described in section 4.1. We there-
fore carried out some experiments with the ulti-
mate aim to enrich the corpus with metadata about
text genre, topic and function, using automated
techniques.
In order to gain some insights into the com-
position of PAIS
`
A, we first conducted some man-
ual investigations. Drawing on existing literature
on web genres (e.g. (Santini, 2005; Rehm et al.,
2008; Santini et al., 2010)) and text classification
according to text function and topic (e.g. (Sharoff,
2006)), we developed a tentative three-fold taxon-
omy to be used for text classification. Following
four cycles of sample manual annotation by three
annotators, categories were adjusted in order to
better reflect the nature of PAIS
`
A?s web documents
(cf. (Sharoff, 2010) about differences between do-
mains covered in the BNC and in the web-derived
ukWaC). Details about the taxonomy are provided
in Borghetti et al. (2011). Then, we started to
cross-check whether the devised taxonomy was
indeed appropriate to describe PAIS
`
A?s composi-
tion by comparing its categories with data result-
ing from the application of unsupervised methods
for text classification.
Interesting insights have emerged so far re-
garding the topic category. Following Sharoff
(2010), we used topic modelling based on La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation for the detection of top-
ics: 20 clusters/topics were identified on the ba-
sis of keywords (the number of clusters to re-
trieve is a user-defined parameter) and projected
onto the manually defined taxonomy. This re-
vealed that most of the 20 automatically iden-
tified topics could be reasonably matched to
one of the 8 categories included in the tax-
onomy; exceptions were represented by clus-
ters characterised by proper nouns and gen-
eral language words such bambino/uomo/famiglia
(?child?/?man?/?family?) or credere/sentire/sperare
(?to believe?/?feel?/?hope?), which may in fact be
indicative of genres such as diary or personal com-
ment (e.g. personal blog). Only one of the cate-
gories originally included in the taxonomy ? natu-
ral sciences ? was not represented in the clusters,
which may indicate that there are few texts within
PAIS
`
A belonging to this domain. One of the ma-
14
In fact, even the nature of the targeted texts is not pre-
cisely defined: for instance, Wikipedia articles can actually
encompass a variety of text types such as biographies, intro-
ductions to academic theories etc. (Santini et al., 2010, p. 15)
jor advantages of topic models is that each corpus
document can be associated ? to varying degrees ?
to several topics/clusters: if encoded as metadata,
this information makes it possible not only to fil-
ter texts according to their prevailing domain, but
also to represent the heterogeneous nature of many
web documents.
5 Corpus Access and Usage
5.1 Corpus distribution
The PAIS
`
A corpus is distributed in two ways: it is
made available for download and it can be queried
via its online interface. For both cases, no restric-
tions on its usage apply other than those defined
by the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. For
corpus download, both the raw text version and the
annotated corpus in CoNLL format are provided.
The PAIS
`
A corpus together with all project-
related information is accessible via the project
web site at http://www.corpusitaliano.it
5.2 Corpus interface
The creation of a dedicated open online interface
for the PAIS
`
A corpus has been a declared primary
objective of the project.
The interface is aimed at providing a power-
ful, effective and easy-to-employ tool for mak-
ing full use of the resource, without having to go
through downloading, installation or registration
procedures. It is targeted at different user groups,
particularly language learners, teachers, and lin-
guists. As users of PAIS
`
A are expected to show
varying levels of proficiency in terms of language
competence, linguistic knowledge, and concern-
ing the use of online search tools, the interface
has been designed to provide four separate search
components, implementing different query modes.
Initially, the user is directed to a basic keyword
search that adopts a ?Google-style? search box.
Single search terms, as well as multi-word combi-
nations or sequences can be searched by inserting
them in a simple text box.
The second component is an advanced graph-
ical search form. It provides elaborated search
options for querying linguistic annotation layers
and allows for defining distances between search
terms as well as repetitions or optionally occurring
terms. Furthermore, the advanced search supports
regular expressions.
The third component emulates a command-line
search via the powerful CQP query language of
40
the Open Corpus Workbench (Evert and Hardie,
2011). It allows for complex search queries in
CQP syntax that rely on linguistic annotation lay-
ers as well as on metadata information.
Finally, a filter interface is presented in a fourth
component. It serves the purpose of retriev-
ing full-text corpus documents based on keyword
searches as well as text statistics (see section 4.3).
Like the CQP interface, the filter interface is also
supporting the building of temporary subcorpora
for subsequent querying.
By default, search results are displayed as
KWIC (KeyWord In Context) lines, centred
around the search expression. Each search hit can
be expanded to its full sentence view. In addition,
the originating full text document can be accessed
and its source URL is provided.
Based on an interactive visualisation for depen-
dency graphs (Culy et al., 2011) for each search
result a graphical representations of dependency
relations together with the sentence and associated
lemma and part-of-speech information can be gen-
erated (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: Dependency diagram
Targeted at novice language learners of Italian,
a filter for automatically restricting search results
to sentences of limited complexity has been in-
tegrated into each search component. When ac-
tivated, search results are automatically filtered
based on a combination of the complexity mea-
sures introduced in section 4.3.
5.3 Technical details
The PAIS
`
A online interface has been developed in
several layers: in essence, it provides a front-end
to the corpus as indexed in Open Corpus Work-
bench (Evert and Hardie, 2011). This corpus
query engine provides the fundamental search ca-
pabilities through the CQP language. Based on
the CWB/Perl API that is part of the Open Corpus
Workbench package, a web service has been de-
veloped at EURAC which exposes a large part of
the CQP language
15
through a RESTful API.
16
The four types of searches provided by the on-
line interface are developed on top of this web ser-
vice. The user queries are translated into CQP
queries and passed to the web service. In many
cases, such as the free word order queries in the
simple and advanced search forms, more than one
CQP query is necessary to produce the desired
result. Other functionalities implemented in this
layer are the management of subcorpora and the
filtering by complexity. The results returned by
the web service are then formatted and presented
to the user.
The user interface as well as the mechanisms
for translation of queries from the web forms into
CQP have been developed server-side in PHP.
The visualizations are implemented client-side in
JavaScript and jQuery, the dependency graphs
based on the xLDD framework (Culy et al., 2011).
5.4 Extraction of lexico-syntactic information
PAIS
`
A is currently used in the CombiNet project
?Word Combinations in Italian ? Theoretical and
descriptive analysis, computational models, lexi-
cographic layout and creation of a dictionary?.
17
The project goal is to study the combinatory prop-
erties of Italian words by developing advanced
computational linguistics methods for extracting
distributional information from PAIS
`
A.
In particular, CombiNet uses a pattern-based
approach to extract a wide range of multiword
expressions, such as phrasal lexemes, colloca-
tions, and usual combinations. POS n-grams
are automatically extracted from PAIS
`
A, and then
ranked according to different types of associa-
tion measures (e.g., pointwise mutual informa-
tion, log-likelihood ratios, etc.). Extending the
LexIt methodology (Lenci et al., 2012), CombiNet
also extracts distributional profiles from the parsed
layer of PAIS
`
A, including the following types of
information:
1. syntactic slots (subject, complements, modi-
15
To safeguard the system against malicious attacks, secu-
rity measures had to be taken at several of the layers, which
unfortunately also make some of the more advanced CQP fea-
tures inaccessible to the user.
16
Web services based on REST (Representational State
Transfer) principles employ standard concepts such as a URI
and standard HTTP methods to provide an interface to func-
tionalities on a remote host.
17
3-year PRIN(2010/2011)-project, coordination by Raf-
faele Simone ? University of Rome Tre
41
fiers, etc.) and subcategorization frames;
2. lexical sets filling syntactic slots (e.g. proto-
typical subjects of a target verb);
3. semantic classes describing selectional pref-
erences of syntactic slots (e.g. the direct obj.
of mangiare/?to eat? typically selects nouns
referring to food, while its subject selects an-
imate nouns); semantic roles of predicates.
The saliency and typicality of combinatory pat-
terns are weighted by means of different statisti-
cal indexes and the resulting profiles will be used
to define a distributional semantic classification of
Italian verbs, comparable to the one elaborated in
the VerbNet project (Kipper et al., 2008).
6 Evaluation
We performed post-crawl evaluations on the data.
For licensing, we analysed 200,534 pages that
were originally collected for the PAIS
`
A corpus,
and only 1,060 were identified as containing no
CC license link (99.95% with CC mark-up). Then,
from 10,000 randomly selected non-CC-licensed
Italian pages 15 were wrongly identified as CC li-
censed containing CC mark-up (0.15% error). For
language identification we checked the harvested
corpus part with the CLD2 toolkit
18
, and > 99%
of the data was identified as Italian.
The pos-tagger has been adapted to peculiari-
ties of the PAIS
`
A web texts, by manually correct-
ing sample annotation output and re-training the
tagger accordingly. Following the active learning
approach as described in section 4.2 we built a new
pos-tagger model based on 40.000 manually re-
vised tokens. With the new model, we obtained
an improvement in accuracy of 1% on a test-set
of 5000 tokens extracted from PAIS
`
A. Final tag-
ger accuracy reached 96.03%.
7 Conclusion / Future Work
In this paper we showed how a contemporary and
free language resource of Italian with linguistic
annotations can be designed, implemented and de-
veloped from the web and made available for dif-
ferent types of language users.
Future work will focus on enriching the cor-
pus with metadata by means of automatic clas-
sification techniques, so as to make a better as-
sessment of corpus composition. A multi-faceted
18
Compact Language Detection 2, http://code.
google.com/p/cld2/
approach combining linguistic features extracted
from texts (content/function words ratio, sentence
length, word frequency, etc.) and information
extracted from document URLs (e.g., tags like
?wiki?, ?blog?) might be particularly suitable for
genre and function annotation.
Metadata annotation will enable more advanced
applications of the corpus for language teaching
and learning purposes. In this respect, existing
exemplifications of the use of the PAIS
`
A inter-
face for language learning and teaching (Lyding et
al., 2013) could be followed by further pedagogi-
cal proposals as well as empowered by dedicated
teaching guidelines for the exploitation of the cor-
pus and its web interface in the class of Italian as
a second language.
In a more general perspective, we envisage
a tighter integration between acquisition of new
texts, automated text annotation and development
of lexical and language learning resources allow-
ing even non-specialised users to carve out and
develop their own language data. This ambitious
goal points in the direction of a fully-automatised
control of the entire life-cycle of open-access Ital-
ian language resources with a view to address an
increasingly wider range of potential demands.

Abstract
The paper investigates the problem of
sentence readability assessment, which is
modelled as a classification task, with a
specific view to text simplification. In par-
ticular, it addresses two open issues con-
nected with it, i.e. the corpora to be used
for training, and the identification of the
most effective features to determine sen-
tence readability. An existing readabil-
ity assessment tool developed for Italian
was specialized at the level of training cor-
pus and learning algorithm. A maximum
entropy?based feature selection and rank-
ing algorithm (grafting) was used to iden-
tify to the most relevant features: it turned
out that assessing the readability of sen-
tences is a complex task, requiring a high
number of features, mainly syntactic ones.
1 Introduction
Over the last ten years, work on automatic read-
ability assessment employed sophisticated NLP
techniques (such as syntactic parsing and statisti-
cal language modeling) to capture highly complex
linguistic features, and used statistical machine
learning to build readability assessment tools. A
variety of different NLP?based approaches has
been proposed so far in the literature, differing
at the level of the number of identified readabil-
ity classes, the typology of features taken into ac-
count, the intended audience of the texts under
evaluation, or the application within which read-
ability assessment is carried out, etc.
Research focused so far on readability assess-
ment at the document level. However, as pointed
out by Skory and Eskenazi (2010), methods devel-
oped perform well when the task is characterizing
the readability level of an entire document, while
they are unreliable for short texts, including single
sentences. Yet, for specific applications, assessing
the readability level of individual sentences would
be desirable. This is the case, for instance, for text
simplification: in current approaches, text read-
ability is typically assessed with respect to the en-
tire document, while text simplification is carried
out at the sentence level, as e.g. done in Alu??sio
et al. (2010), Bott and Saggion (2011) and Inui et
al. (2003). By decoupling the readability assess-
ment and simplification processes, the impact of
simplification operations on the overall readabil-
ity level of a given text may not always be clear.
With sentence?based readability assessment, this
is expected to be no longer a problem. Sentence
readability assessment thus represents an open is-
sue in the literature which is worth being further
explored. To our knowledge, the only attempts
in this direction are represented by Dell?Orletta et
al. (2011) and Sj?oholm (2012) for the Italian and
Swedish languages respectively, followed more
recently by Vajjala and Meurers (2014) dealing
with English.
In this paper, we tackle the challenge of assess-
ing the readability of individual sentences as a first
step towards text simplification. The task is mod-
elled as a classification task, with the final aim
of shedding light on two open issues connected
with it, namely the reference corpora to be used
for training (i.e. collections of sentences classified
according to their readability level), and the iden-
tification of the most effective features to deter-
mine sentence readability. For what concerns the
former, sentence readability assessment poses the
remarkable issue of classifying sentences accord-
ing to their difficulty: if all sentences occurring in
simplified texts can be assumed to be easy?to?read
sentences, the reverse does not necessarily hold
since not all sentences occurring in complex texts
are to be assumed difficult?to?read. This fact has
important implications at the level of the composi-
tion of the corpora to be used for training. The sec-
163
ond issue is concerned with whether and to what
extent the features playing a significant role in the
assessment of readability at the sentence level co-
incide with those exploited at the level of docu-
ment. In particular, the following research ques-
tions are addressed:
1. in assessing sentence readability, is it bet-
ter to use a small gold standard training cor-
pus of manually classified sentences or a
much bigger training corpus automatically
constructed from readability?tagged docu-
ments possibly containing misclassified sen-
tences?
2. which are the features maximizing sentence
readability assessment?
3. to what extent do important features for sen-
tence readability classification match those
playing a role in the document readability
classification?
We will try to answer these questions by work-
ing on Italian, which is a less?resourced language
as far as readability is concerned. To this end,
READ?IT (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011; Dell?Orletta
et al., 2014), which represents the first NLP?based
readability assessment tool for Italian, was spe-
cialized in different respects, namely at the level of
the training corpus and of the learning algorithm;
to investigate questions 2. and 3. above, a maxi-
mum entropy?based feature selection and ranking
algorithm (i.e. grafting) was selected. The specific
target audience of readers addressed in this study
is represented by people characterised by low lit-
eracy skills and/or by mild cognitive impairment.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the background literature, Section 3 intro-
duces our approach to the task, in terms of used
corpora, features and learning algorithm. Finally,
Sections 4 and 5 describe the experimental setting
and discuss achieved results.
2 Background
In spite of the acknowledged need of perform-
ing readability assessment at the sentence level,
so far very few attempts have been made to sys-
tematically investigate the issues and challenges
concerned with the readability assessment of sen-
tences (as opposed to documents). The first two
studies in this direction focused on languages
other than English, namely Italian (Dell?Orletta
et al., 2011) and Swedish (Sj?oholm, 2012). In
both cases, the authors start from the assump-
tion that while all sentences occurring in simpli-
fied texts can be assumed to be easy?to?read sen-
tences, the reverse is not true, since not all sen-
tences occurring in complex texts are difficult?to?
read. This has important consequences at the level
of the evaluation of sentence classification results:
i.e. erroneous readability assessments within the
class of difficult?to?read texts may either corre-
spond to those easy?to?read sentences occurring
within complex texts or represent real classifi-
cation errors. To overcome this problem in the
readability assessment of individual sentences, a
notion of distance with respect to easy-to-read
sentences was introduced by Dell?Orletta et al.
(2011). Focusing on English, a similar issue is
addressed more recently by Vajjala and Meur-
ers (2014) who developed a binary sentence clas-
sifier trained on Wikipedia and Simple English
Wikipedia: they showed that the low accuracy ob-
tained by their classifier stems from the incorrect
assumption that all Wikipedia sentences are more
complex than the Simple Wikipedia ones.
Besides readability, sentence?based analyses
are reported in the literature for related tasks: for
instance, in a text simplification scenario by Drn-
darevi?c et al. (2013), Alu??sio et al. (2008),
?
Stajner
and Saggion (2013) and Barlacchi and Tonelli
(2013); or to predict writing quality level by Louis
and Nenkova (2013). Sheikha and Inkpen (2012)
report the results of both document? and sentence?
based classification in the different but related task
of assessing formal vs. informal style of a docu-
ment/sentence. For students learning English, An-
dersen et al. (2013) made a self?assessment and
tutoring system available which was able to assign
a quality score for each individual sentence they
write: this provides automated feedback on learn-
ers? writing.
A further important issue, largely investigated
in previous readability assessment studies, is the
identification of linguistic factors playing a role
in assessing the readability of documents. If tra-
ditional readability metrics (see e.g., Kincaid et
al. (1975)) typically rely on raw text characteris-
tics, such as word and sentence length, the new
NLP?based readability indices exploit wider sets
of features ranging across different linguistic lev-
els. Starting from Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005)
and Heilman et al. (2007), the role of syntactic
164
features in this task was considered, and more re-
cently, the role of discourse features (e.g., dis-
course topic, discourse cohesion and coherence)
has also been taken into account (see e.g., Barzi-
lay and Lapata (2008), Pitler and Nenkova (2008),
Kate et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2010) and Tonelli
et al. (2012)). Many of these studies also explored
the usefulness of features belonging to individual
levels of linguistic description in predicting text
readability. For example, Feng et al. (2010) sys-
tematically evaluated a wide range of features and
compared the results of different statistical classi-
fiers trained on different classes of features. Sim-
ilarly, the correlation between level?specific fea-
tures has been calculated by Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) with respect to human readability judg-
ments, and by Franc?ois and Fairon (2012) with
respect to readability levels. In both cases, the
classes of features which turned out to be highly
correlated with readability judgments were used
in a readability assessment tool to test their effi-
cacy. Note, however, that in all cases the predic-
tive power of the selected features was evaluated
at the document level only.
3 Our Approach
In this section, we introduce the main ingredi-
ents of our approach to sentence readability as-
sessment, corpora used for training and testing,
selected features and the learning and feature se-
lection algorithm.
3.1 Corpora
We relied on two different corpora: a newspaper
corpus, La Repubblica (henceforth, Rep), and an
easy?to?read newspaper, Due Parole (henceforth,
2Par). 2Par includes articles specifically written
by Italian linguists experts in text simplification
for an audience of adults with a rudimentary lit-
eracy level or with mild intellectual disabilities
(Piemontese, 1996), which represents the target
audience of this study. The two corpora ? selected
as representative of complex vs. simplified texts
within the journalistic genre ? differ significantly
with respect to the distribution of features typi-
cally correlated with text complexity (Dell?Orletta
et al., 2011) and thus represent reliable training
datasets. However, whereas such a distinction is
valid as far as documents are concerned, it appears
to be a simplistic generalization when the focus is
on sentences. In other words, whereas we can con-
sider all sentences of 2Par as easy?to?read, not all
Rep sentences are expected to be difficult?to?read.
From this it follows that whereas the internal com-
position of 2Par is homogeneous at the sentence
level, this is not the case for Rep.
To overcome this asymmetry and in particular
to assess the impact of the noise in the Rep train-
ing corpus, we constructed different training sets
differing in size and internal composition, going
from a noisy set which assumes all Rep sentences
to be difficult?to?read to a clean but smaller set
in which the easy?to?read sentences occurring in
Rep were manually filtered out. These training
sets were used in different experiments whose re-
sults are reported in Section 4.2.
The corpus containing only difficult?to?read
sentences was manually built by annotating Rep
sentences according to their readability (i.e. easy
vs. difficult). The annotation process was car-
ried out by two annotators with a background in
computational linguistics. In order to assess the
reliability of their judgements, we started with a
small annotation experiment: the two annotators
were provided with the same 5 articles from the
Rep corpus (for a total of 107 sentences) and were
asked to extract the difficult?to?read sentences (as
opposed to both easy?to?read and not?easy?to?
classify sentences). The first annotator carried out
the task in 5 minutes and 46 seconds, while the
second annotator took 9 minutes and 8 seconds.
The two annotators agreed on the classification of
81 difficult?to?read sentences out of 107 consid-
ered ones (in particular, the first annotator iden-
tified 90 difficult?to?read?sentences and the sec-
ond one 93 sentences). The agreement between
the two annotators was calculated in terms of pre-
cision, by taking one of the annotation sets as the
gold standard and the other as response: on aver-
age, we obtained a precision of 0.88 in the retrieval
of sentences definitely classified as difficult?to?
read. Given the high level of agreement, the two
annotators were asked to select difficult sentences
from two sets of distinct Rep articles. This re-
sulted in a set of 1,745 difficult?to?read sentences
which were used together with a random selection
of easy?to?read sentences from 2Par for training
and testing.

Table 1: Typology of features and ranking position in sentence and document readability assessment
experiments. Only about 14 features are needed for an adequate model of document readability, whereas
this number increases to 30 for sentence readability (marked in boldface). Features which were not
selected during ranking have no rank.
3.2 Linguistic Features
The set of features used in the experiments re-
ported in this paper is wide, spanning across dif-
ferent levels of linguistic analysis. They can
be broadly classified into four main classes, as
reported in Table 1: raw text features, lexical
features, morpho?syntactic features and syntactic
features, shortly described below.
2
2
For an exhaustive discussion including the motivations
underlying this selection of features, the interested reader is
Raw text features (Features [1?2] in Table 1)
refer to those features typically used within tra-
ditional readability metrics and include sentence
length, calculated as the average number of words
per sentence, and word length, calculated as the
average number of characters per words.
The cover category of lexical features (Features
[3?8] in Table 1) includes features referring to
referred to Dell?Orletta et al. (2011, 2014) where these fea-
tures were successfully used for assessing the readability of
Italian texts.
166
both the internal composition of the vocabulary
and the lexical richness of the text. For what con-
cerns the former, the Basic Italian Vocabulary by
De Mauro (2000) was taken as a reference re-
source, including a list of 7000 words highly fa-
miliar to native speakers of Italian. In particular,
we consider: a) the percentage of all unique words
(types) on this reference list occurring in the text,
and b) the internal distribution of the occurring ba-
sic Italian vocabulary words into the usage classi-
fication classes of ?fundamental words? (very fre-
quent words), ?high usage words? (frequent words)
and ?high availability words? (relatively lower fre-
quency words referring to everyday life). Lexical
richness of texts is monitored by computing the
Type/Token Ratio (TTR), which refers to the ratio
between the number of lexical types and the num-
ber of tokens within a text. Due to its sensitivity
to sample size, this feature is computed for text
samples of equivalent length.
The set of morpho?syntactic features (Features
[9?41] in Table 1) is aimed at capturing differ-
ent aspects of the linguistic structure affecting in
one way or another the readability of a text. They
range from the probability distribution of part?
of?speech (POS) types, to the lexical density of
the text, calculated as the ratio of content words
(verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the to-
tal number of lexical tokens in a text. This class
also includes features referring to the distribution
of verbs by mood and/or tense, which can be seen
as a language?specific feature exploiting the pre-
dictive power of the Italian rich morphology.
The set of syntactic features (Features [42?87]
in Table 1) captures different aspects of the syntac-
tic structure which are taken as reliable indicators
for automatic readability assessment, namely:
? the unconditional probability of syntactic de-
pendency types, e.g. subject, direct object,
modifier, etc. (Features 42?70);
? parse tree depth features (71?72), going from
the depth of the whole parse tree, calculated
in terms of the longest path from the root
of the dependency tree to some leaf, to a
more specific feature referring to the aver-
age depth of embedded complement ?chains?
governed by a nominal head and including
either prepositional complements or nominal
and adjectival modifiers;
? verbal predicate features (73?78) aimed at
capturing different aspects of the behaviour
of verbal predicates: they range from the
number of verbal roots with respect to num-
ber of all sentence roots occurring in a text,
to more specific features such as the arity
of verbs, meant as the number of instanti-
ated dependency links sharing the same ver-
bal head (covering both arguments and modi-
fiers) and the relative ordering of subject and
object with respect to the verbal head;
? as subordination is widely acknowledged
to be an index of structural complexity
in language, subordination features (79?
85) include: the distribution of subordinate
vs. main clauses; for subordinates, the dis-
tribution of infinitives vs finite complement
clauses, their relative ordering with respect
to the main clause and the average depth of
?chains? of embedded subordinate clauses;
? the length of dependency links is another
characteristic connected with the syntactic
complexity of sentences. Features 86?87
measure dependency length in terms of the
words occurring between the syntactic head
and the dependent: they focus on all depen-
dency links vs. maximum dependency links
only.
3.3 Model Training and Feature Ranking
Given the twofold goal of this study, i.e. re-
liably assessing sentence readability and finding
the most predictive features undelying it, we used
GRAFTING (Perkins et al., 2003), as this approach
allows to train a maximum entropy model while si-
multaneously including incremental feature selec-
tion. The method uses a gradient?based heuristic
to select the most promising feature (to add to the
set of selected features S), and then performs a full
weight optimization over all features in S. This
process is repeated until a certain stopping crite-
rion is reached. As the grafting approach we use
integrates the l
1
regularization (preventing overfit-
ting), features are only included (i.e. have a non-
zero weight) when the reduction of the objective
function is greater than a certain treshold. In our
case, the l
1
prior we use was selected on the basis
of evaluating maximum entropy models with vary-
ing l
1
values (range: 1e-11, 1e-10, ..., 0.1, 1) via
10?fold cross validation. We used TINYEST
3
, a

167
grafting-capable maximum entropy parameter es-
timator for ranking tasks (de Kok, 2011; de Kok,
2013), to select the features and estimate their
weights. Whereas our task is not a ranking task,
but rather a binary classification problem, we were
able to model it as a ranking task by assigning a
high score (1) to difficult?to?read sentences and a
low score (0) to easy?to?read sentences. Conse-
quently, a sentence having a score < 0.5 was in-
terpreted as an easy?to?read sentence, whereas a
sentence which was assigned a score ? 0.5 was
interpreted to be a difficult?to?read sentence.
4 Experiments and Results
4.1 Experimental Setup
In all experiments, the corpora were automatically
tagged by the part?of?speech tagger described
in Dell?Orletta (2009) and dependency?parsed by
the DeSR parser (Attardi, 2006) using Support
Vector Machines as learning algorithm. We de-
vised two different experiments, aimed at explor-
ing the research questions investigated in this pa-
per. To this end, READ?IT was adapted by inte-
grating a specialized training corpus and a maxi-
mum entropy?based feature selection and ranking
algorithm (i.e. grafting).
Experiment 1
This experiment, investigating the first research
question, is aimed at identifying what is the most
effective training data for sentence readability as-
sessment. In particular, the goal is to compare
the results on the basis of using a small set of
gold standard data with respect to a (potentially
larger, but) noisy data set (i.e. without manual re-
vision) where every Rep sentence was assumed to
be difficult?to?read. In particular, the comparison
involved four datasets:
? a collection of gold standard data consisting
of 1,310 easy?to?read sentences randomly
extracted from the 2Par corpus and 1,310
manually selected difficult?to-read sentences
from the Rep corpus;
? a large and unbalanced collection of uncor-
rected data consisting of the whole 2Par cor-
pus (3,910 easy?to?read sentences) and the
whole Rep corpus (8,452 sentences, classi-
fied a priori as difficult?to?read);
? a balanced collection of uncorrected sen-
tences, consisting of 3,910 sentences from
2Par and 3,910 sentences from Rep;
? a balanced collection of uncorrected sen-
tences having the same size as the gold stan-
dard dataset, namely 1,310 sentences from
2Par and 1,310 sentences from Rep.
To assess similarities and differences at the level
of the different corpora used for training in this
experiment, in Table 2 we report a selection of
linguistic features (see Section 3.2) characterizing
the four datasets with respect to the whole 2Par
corpus.We can observe that 2Par differs from all
four Rep corpora for all reported features, and that
the four Rep corpora show similar trends. Inter-
estingly, however, the Rep Gold corpus is almost
always the most distant one from 2Par (i.e. at the
level of sentence length, word length, distribution
of adjectives and subjects, average length of de-
pendency links and parse tree depth).
On the basis of the four Rep datasets, four mod-
els were built which we evaluated using a held?
out test set consisting of 435 sentences from 2Par
and 435 manually classified difficult?to?read sen-
tences from Rep. Using the grafting method, we
calculated the classification score for each sen-
tence in our test set on the basis of an increasing
number of features (ranging from 1 to all non-zero
weighted features for the specific dataset): sen-
tences with a score below 0.5 were classified as
easy?to?read, whereas sentences having a score
greater or equal to 0.5 were classified as difficult?
to?read. This procedure was repeated for each of
the four models.
Experiment 2
The second experiment is aimed at answering our
second and third research questions, focusing on
the features relevant for sentence readability, and
the relationship of those features with document
readability classification. For this purpose, we
compared sentence? and document?based read-
ability classification results. In particular, we com-
pared the features used by the sentence?based
readability model trained on the gold standard
data and the features used by the document?based
model trained on Rep and 2Par. With respect
to the document classification, we used a cor-
pus of 638 documents (319 extracted from 2Par
representating easy?to?read texts, and 319 ex-
tracted from Rep representing difficult?to?read
texts) with 20% of the documents constituting the
held?out test set.

4.2 Which Training Corpus for Sentence
Classification?
Table 3 reports the results for the sentence classi-
fication task using the four training datasets de-
scribed above. Results are reported in terms of
both overall accuracy (calculated as the proportion
of correct answers against all answers) and preci-
sion within each readability class (when using all
features), defined as the number of easy or diffi-
cult sentences correctly identified as such (in their
respective columns).
Accuracy was computed for all training models
tested using an increasing number of features (2,
10, 30, 50 and all features) as resulting from the
GRAFTING?based ranking and detailed in Table 1.
Note that the first two features correspond in all
cases to the traditional readability features of sen-
tence length and word length. The classification
model trained on the small gold standard dataset
turned out to almost always outperform all other
models: it achieved the best accuracy (83.7%) us-
ing a relatively small number of features (66), and
also for a fixed number of features (i.e. 2, 30
and 50). Only when using the top?10 features,
the uncorrected balanced large dataset slightly out-
performed the gold standard dataset. The accu-
racy when using the unbalanced dataset for train-
ing was always significantly (p < 0.05) worse (us-
ing McNemar?s test) than the accuracy based on
the other training data. The only other significant
difference existed between the balanced small and
large dataset for 10 features. All other differences
are non?significant.
It is also interesting to note that in the results
reported in column 2 ft of Table 3 a significant
difference is observed when comparing the accu-
racy achieved using the unbalanced large data set
with that achieved with the gold standard data: i.e.
about 15.5 percentage points of difference for the
2 ft model against 3 ? 6% using higher numbers
of features. This result originates from the fact that
the unbalanced corpus contains to a larger extent
sentences which are short and complex at the same
time whose correct readability assessment requires
linguistically?grounded features (see below).
The last two columns of Table 3 report preci-
sion results for easy? vs. difficult?to?read sen-
tences for each of the four training datasets (all
features). It is clear that for the class of difficult?
to?read sentences the highest precision (88.5%) is
obtained when using the whole 2Par and Rep cor-
pora for training (i.e. unbalanced large), whereas
for the class of easy?to?read sentences the best
precision results (84.8%) are obtained with the
system trained on the gold standard dataset. In-
terestingly, the worst precision results (69.2%) are
reported for the class of easy?to?read sentences
with the unbalanced large training data set.
These results suggest that the advantages of us-
ing the gold standard data over the uncorrected
training data sets are limited. From this it fol-
lows that treating the whole Rep corpus as a col-
lection of difficult?to?read sentences is not com-
pletely unjustified: this is in line with the satisfac-
tory results reported by Dell?Orletta et al. (2011)
where Rep was used for training a sentence read-
169
ability classifier without any manual filtering of
sentences. Nevertheless, the results of this ex-
periment demonstrate that readability assessment
accuracy and in particular the precision in identi-
fying easy?to?read sentences can be improved by
using a manually selected training dataset. Bal-
ancing the size of larger but potentially noisy (i.e.
without manual revision) data sets appears to cre-
ate a positive trade?off between accuracy and pre-
cision for both classes, thus representing a viable
alternative to the construction of a gold standard
dataset.
4.3 Sentence vs. Document Classification:
which and how many features?
To identify the typology of features needed for
sentence readability assessment and compare them
to those needed for assessing document read-
ability, we compared the results obtained by the
grafting?based feature selection in the sentence
classification task (using the gold standard dataset
for training, see Table 3) to those obtained in the
document classification task whose accuracy on
the test set is reported in Table 4 for increasing
numbers of features selected via GRAFTING.
Train. data 2 ft 10 ft 30 ft 50 ft 70 ft (all)
Rep - 2Par 80 93.3 96.6 96.6 95
Table 4: Accuracy of document classification for
a varying number of features
By comparing the document classification re-
sults with respect to those obtained for sentences,
it can be noticed that the best accuracy is achieved
using a set of 30 features: in contrast to sentence
classification where adding features keeps increas-
ing the performance, more features do not appear
to help for document classification. Sentence read-
ability classification thus seems to be a more com-
plex task, requiring a higher amount of features.
This trend emerges more clearly in Figures 1(a)
and 1(b), where the classification results on the
training set (using 10?fold cross?validation) and
the held?out test set are visualized for increas-
ing amounts of features selected via GRAFTING.
As Figure 1(a) shows, the document classifica-
tion task requires about 14 features after which
the performance appears to stabilize (97.4% accu-
racy for the ten?fold cross-validation and 96.7%
for the held?out test set). In contrast, Figure
1(b) shows that sentence classification requires at
least 30 features (83.4% accuracy for the ten?fold
cross-validation and 79.9% for the test set).
Noticeable differences can also be observed in
the typology of features playing a prominent role
in the two tasks. For each feature taken into ac-
count, Table 1 reports its ranking as resulting from
sentence? and document?based classification ex-
periments (columns ?Sent. class.? and ?Doc.
class.? respectively). Note that in interpreting
the rank associated with each feature it should
be considered that in sentence? and document?
classification the number of required features is
significantly different, i.e. 30 and 14 respectively:
this is to say that approximately the same rank as-
sociated to the same feature does not entail a com-
parable role across the two classification tasks.
As already pointed out, for both sentences and
documents raw text features (i.e. Sentence length
and Word length) turned out to be the top features,
leading however to significantly different results:
i.e. 80% accuracy for documents vs. 65% for
sentences. Among the remaining features, graft-
ing results show that syntactic features do play
a central role in both sentence? and document?
based readability assessment: many of these are
highly ranked, with some differences. Syntactic
features playing a similar role in both readabil-
ity classification tasks include: Verbal root [73],
Parse tree depth [71], ?Chains? of embedded sub-
ordinate clauses [83] and Max. length of depen-
dency links [87], covering important aspects of
syntactic complexity such as depth of the syntactic
dependency (sub?)tree and length of dependency
links. Features that are mainly useful for sentence
readability turned out to be Arity of verbal pred-
icates [74], Pre?verbal subject [75], Post?verbal
object [78] and Embedded complement ?chains?
[72], which can all be seen as representing local
features referring to sentence parts. The feature
Subordinate clauses in pre?verbal position [81],
focusing on the global distribution of pre?verbal
subordinate clauses within the document, is rele-
vant for document classification only. It is interest-
ing to note that features capturing different facets
of the same phenomenon can play quite a different
role for assessing the readability of sentences vs.
documents: this is the case of dependency length,
measured in terms of the words occurring between
the syntactic head and the dependent, where fea-
ture [86] refers to the average length of all de-
pendency links and [87] to the average length of
170
(a) Document classification (b) Sentence classification
Figure 1: Document vs Sentence classification results
maximum dependency links from each sentence.
Whereas [86] plays a similar role for sentences
and documents (in both cases it is a middle rank
feature), [87] is a global feature playing a more
prominent role in document classification.
At the morpho?syntactic level, the feature rank-
ing is more comparable. However, it is interest-
ing to note that very few morpho?syntactic fea-
tures were selected by the feature selection pro-
cess: this is particularly true for document classi-
fication. This can follow from the fact that these
features can be considered as proxies of the syn-
tactic structure which in these experiments was
represented through specific features: in this situ-
ation, the grafting process preferred syntactic fea-
tures over morpho?syntactic ones, in spite of the
lower accuracy of the dependency parser with re-
spect to the part?of?speech tagger. Interestingly,
this result is in contrast with what reported by
Falkenjack and J?onsson (2014) for what concerns
document readability assessment, who claim that
an optimal subset of text features for readability
based document classification does not need fea-
tures induced via parsing. Among the morpho?
syntactic features, it appears that verbal features
play an important role: this can follow both by the
language dealt with which is a a morphologically
rich language, and by the fact that these features
do not have a counterpart at the syntactic level.
Lexical features show a much more mixed re-
sult. Type?Token Ratio (TTR) is only important
for document classification, whereas most of the
other features are important for sentence readabil-
ity, but not for document readability (with the ex-
ception of the presence of ?fundamental words? of
the Basic Italian Vocabulary).
5 Discussion
In this study we have focused on three research
questions. First, we asked which type of train-
ing corpus is best to assess sentence readability.
Whereas we found that using a set of manually
selected complex sentences was better than using
a simple corpus?based distinction, the extra ef-
fort needed to construct the training corpus might
not be worthwhile as observed improvements were
quite modest. However, we did not consider a
more sensitive measure of the difficulty of a sen-
tence (such as a number ranging between 0 and
1), and this might be able to offer a more sub-
stantial improvement (at the cost of needing more
time to create the training material). Of course,
when the goal is to identify the best features for
assessing sentence readability, it does make sense
to have high?quality training data to prevent se-
lecting inadequate features. The second research
question involved identifying which features were
most useful for assessing sentence readability. Be-
sides raw text features, syntactic but also morpho?
syntactic features turned out to play a central role
to achieve adequate performance. The third re-
search question investigated the overlap between
the features needed for document and sentence
readability classification. Whereas there certainly
was overlap between the top features (with dif-
ferent levels of performance), most of the fea-
tures had a different rank across the two tasks,
with local features being more predictive for sen-
tence classification and global ones for documents.
This suggests that the sentence readability task is
more complex than assessing document readabil-
ity, given that there is much less information avail-
able for a sentence than for a document.
