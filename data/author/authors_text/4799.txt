Abstract
Text mining tools are designed to assist users
with the important step of hypothesis genera-
tion. In this research we apply an open discov-
ery process to the problem of identifying novel
disease or problem contexts in which a sub-
stance may have therapeutic potential. We il-
lustrate this discovery process by executing our
open discovery algorithm with turmeric (Cur-
cumin Longa) as the substance being investi-
gated. The top ranking entry suggested by the
algorithm is retinal diseases. Further analysis
of the literature yields evidence supporting the
suggested connection between curcumin and
retinal diseases. In particular, curcumin influ-
ences the activation of genes such as COX-2,
TNF-alpha, JNK, ERK and NF-kappaB. These
genes are in turn involved in retinal diseases
such as diabetic retinopathies, ocular inflam-
mation and glaucoma. Moreover, the evidence
suggests that curcumin may have a beneficial
and therapeutic role in the context of these dis-
eases.
1 Introduction
Consider a bioscientist who is studying a particular dis-
ease. Assume that she is already well familiar with
the pathophysiology and accepted therapeutic options for
treating this condition and wishes to determine if there
are other, yet unrecognized, substances that may have
therapeutic potential. She begins by searching for doc-
uments on the disease mechanism(s) and related disor-
ders. Very soon she finds herself immersed in a morass
of pathways and possible directions that need to be fur-
ther explored. It will come as no surprise if even our most
determined user quickly becomes overwhelmed and dis-
couraged. The challenge of searching for a novel thera-
peutic substance is at best like looking for the proverbial
?needle in a haystack?. However, in reality the challenge
is greater since there is no assurance that there indeed is
a needle in the haystack. Consequently, the goal of text
mining (also known as literature mining) systems and al-
gorithms is to assist users find such needles, if these exist
at all in the literature ?haystacks? (Hearst 1999).
In general, as shown in Figure 1, a user may start with
any type of topic (A), be it a disease, a pharmacological
substance, or a specific gene. As he navigates the lit-
erature and follows connections through appropriate in-
termediate topics (B1, B2 etc.), the user hopes to reach
terminal topics (C1, C2 etc.) that are both relevant and
novel, in the sense of shedding new information on topic
(A). This text mining approach commonly referred to as
?open? discovery was pioneered by Swanson in the mid
80s. A classic example discovery is one where start-
ing with Raynaud?s disease (A) Swanson identified fish
oils (C) as a substance that may have therapeutic po-
tential (Swanson, 1986). Intermediate connections (B)
such as ?blood viscosity?, ?platelet aggregation? were ob-
served. Swanson also proposed a variation called ?closed?
discovery wherein starting with a pair of topics (A and
C) one explores possible connections (B links) between
them that are not yet recognized. In collaboration with
Smalheiser, Swanson used his open and closed discov-
ery methods on MEDLINE and proposed a number of
hypotheses (eg. Swanson, 1990; Smalheiser & Swan-
son1996a; Smalheiser & Swanson1996b; Smalheiser &
Swanson1998). The hypotheses they proposed were sub-
sequently corroborated in clinical studies.
The text mining framework established by Swanson
and Smalheiser has attracted the attention of several re-
searchers (Gordon and Lindsay, 1996; Lindsay and Gor-
don, 1999; Weeber et al, 2001) besides us (Srinivasan,
2004). A key goal in these follow-up efforts has been to
reduce the amount of manual effort and intervention re-
quired during the discovery process. In previous work

Figure 1: Open Discovery: The General Model
using algorithms for MEDLINE which we developed, we
replicated the eight open and closed discoveries made by
Swanson and Smalheiser. In comparison with other repli-
cation studies these algorithms were the most effective
(Srinivasan, 2004). They also require the least amount of
manual input and analyses. For example, in open discov-
ery, our methods expect the user to specify only the type
of B terms of interest. Following this our algorithm se-
lects B terms automatically. In contrast the other methods
rely more on user input for selecting B terms. Our cur-
rent research demonstrates that our open discovery algo-
rithm can be used to generate new hypotheses for disease
treatment that could be tested. In particular, we apply
our open discovery procedure to explore the therapeutic
potential of curcumin/turmeric (Curcumin Longa) a di-
etary substance commonly used in Asia. We show that
our automatic discovery algorithm identifies retinal dis-
eases as the novel context for research on curcumin. We
review genetic and biochemical evidence to indicate that
curcumin may be beneficial for treating retinal diseases.
We first describe our open discovery algorithm. Next
we show its application with curcumin as the starting
point (topic A). We then present an analysis of the cur-
cumin - retinal diseases connection. The next section is
on related research. The final section presents our con-
clusions and plans for the next phase of this research.
2 Open Discovery
Our open discovery approach is founded on the notion of
topic profiles. A topic is any subject of interest such as
treatment of hypertension or ATM gene. A profile is es-
sentially a representation of a topic that is derived from
the text collection being mined. For MEDLINE our topic
profiles are vectors of weighted Medical Subject Head-
ings (MeSH). These terms belong to a controlled vocab-
ulary and are manually assigned to each MEDLINE doc-
ument by trained indexers. Given a topic of interest, our
algorithm first retrieves relevant MEDLINE documents.
MeSH terms are then extracted from these documents and
their weights are calculated. These weighted terms form
the profile vector for the topic. We discuss the method for
calculating weights shortly.
We also exploit the fact that MeSH terms have been
classified using 134 UMLS (Unified Medical Language
System)1 semantic types as for example Cell Function,
Sign or Symptom. Each MeSH term is assigned one
or more semantic types. For example, interferon type
II falls within both Immunologic Factor and Pharmaco-
logic Substance semantic types. More generally, seman-
tic types represent ?categories? that have been used to
classify the MeSH metadata. Semantic types are useful
because depending on the nature of the discovery goals
we may adopt a particular view, i.e., we may restrict the
discovery process to consider only MeSH terms that be-
long to certain semantic types. In these cases the topic
profiles are restricted to MeSH terms belonging to seman-
tic types specified by the view.
We calculate term weights for the MeSH terms. Term
weights are a slight modification of the commonly used
TF*IDF scores. Since a MeSH term typically occurs once
in a MEDLINE record, here TFi (term frequency) equals
the number of documents in which the MeSH term ti oc-
curs within the retrieved document set. IDFi (inverse
document frequency) is log(N/TFi). N is the number
of documents retrieved for the topic. Weights are normal-
ized as shown below for term ti. This vector of weighted
MeSH terms forms the topic profile.
weight(ti) = vi/
?
v21 + v
2
2 + ... + v2r , (1)
where vi = TFi ? log(N/TFi) and there are r terms in
the profile.
Algorithm: Figure 2 outlines our open discovery
algorithm which follows the framework shown in Fig-
ure 1. We begin by building the A topic profile restricted
to ST-B semantic types. Note that all MEDLINE
searches are conducted automatically via the PubMed
interface2. We then automatically select M MeSH
terms for each ST-B semantic type from this A profile
and call these the B terms. Next profiles are built for
each of these B terms limited to another selected set
of semantic types ST-C. These B profiles are analysed
in combination to select an initial pool of candidate
C terms. These candidate terms are then checked for
novelty in the context of the starting A topic. When the
algorithm terminates the user is provided a final list of
ranked, novel C terms. The higher the rank the greater
1http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov
2http://www.nlm.nih.gov
the estimated confidence in the potential connection with
the A topic.
At this point the rest of the process depends almost en-
tirely on the user. (This is also the case in other imple-
mentations of the open discovery process (eg. Lindsay &
Gordon 1999; Weeber et al, 2001)). It is up to the user to
select A - C pairs of interest and explore the literature for
supporting evidence.
The role of ST-B and ST-C in the algorithm is to apply
reasonable constraints to the problem and shape the path
of the discovery process. Similarly, parameter M may
be used to focus the discovery process. The higher this
number the bigger the scope through which one looks for
novel C topics. Obviously it takes experience to come
up with reasonable values for these parameters. But
we already see some patterns emerge in the MEDLINE
mining literature. For example when looking for sub-
stances likely to influence a disease several researchers
have used functional semantic types such as Cell Func-
tion and Molecular Dysfunction for selecting intermedi-
ate pathways (eg. Weeber et al, 2001). Experiments
varying these semantic types have been described in our
previous work (Srinivasan, 2004). Unique aspects of our
algorithm in comparison to open discovery methods ex-
plored by others, include for example, the fact that our
weighting scheme identifies interesting and relevant B
terms at high ranks. Also, C terms are assessed by com-
bining the evidence on their connection to the different
intermediate B terms.
3 Open Discovery with Turmeric
Our interest in curcumin was sparked by the fact that this
spice is widely used in Asia and is highly regarded for its
curative and analgesic properties. These include the treat-
ment of burns, stomach ulcers and ailments, and for var-
ious skin diseases. Curcumin is also used as an antisep-
tic, in alleviating symptoms of the common cold as well
as a depilatory. A number of MEDLINE records have
reported on the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory prop-
erties of curcumin (12680238, 12678737, 126760443).
Our open discovery goal is aimed at determining whether
there are novel disease contexts in which curcumin could
prove beneficial, and to propose evidence-based hypothe-
ses that can be experimentally verified.
We executed our open discovery algorithm with cur-
cumin as the starting topic (A). The specific PubMed
search conducted was turmeric OR curcumin OR cur-
cuma (done on November 15, 2003). A total of 1,175
PubMed documents were retrieved. As Figure 3 shows
the majority of these publications (1,043, 89%) are rela-
3Numbers within parantheses such as these refer to PubMed
record ids. The reader may enter these directly into the PubMed
interface to retrieve the corresponding records.
Input from user: (1) an A topic of interest, (2) a
set of UMLS semantic types (ST-B) for selecting
B terms and a set (ST-C) for selecting C terms.
Parameter: M
? Step 1: Conduct an appropriate PubMed
search for topic A, and build its MeSH pro-
file limited to the semantic types in ST-B.
Call this profile AP.
? Step 2: For each semantic type in ST-B, se-
lect theM top ranking MeSH terms from AP.
Remove duplicate terms if any. These are
designated the B terms (B1, B2, B3, etc.).
? Step 3: Conduct an independent PubMed
search for each B term and build its pro-
file limited to the semantic types ST-C. Call
these profiles BP1, BP2, BP3, etc.
? Step 4: Compute a final combined profile
where the combined weight of a MeSH term
is the sum of its weights in BP1, BP2, BP3,
etc. Call this initial profile CP.
? Step 5: For each term t in CP if a MEDLINE
search on topic A AND t returns non zero
results, eliminate t from CP.
Output: For each semantic type in ST-C, output the
MeSH terms in CP ranked by combined weight.
These are the C terms organized by semantic type
and ranked by estimated potential.

tively recent, being published in 1990 or later. This in-
dicates a surge in scientific interest in the health effects
of this spice, which has long been valued in Asia for its
medicinal properties.
We limited ST-B to the three semantic types Gene or
Genome; Enzyme; and Amino Acid, Peptide or Protein.
We restricted ST-C to Disease or Syndrome and Neo-
plastic Process4 and set M (the parameter specifying the
number of B terms to select) to 10. These semantic types
are appropriate since we are looking for biochemical and
genetic connections between turmeric and novel diseases.
Table 1 shows the top 10 selected MeSH terms from
each ST-B type (step 2). We can observe from the table
that some of the terms appear in more than one semantic
type. (This is possible since a term may be assigned to
more than 1 semantic type in the UMLS). However, we
remove duplicates in step 2. Also, some terms are very
specific such as Protein Kinase C while others are broad
representing families such as DNA-Binding Proteins and
Isoenzymes. At present we do not distinguish between B
terms using specificity. Our plan is to examine this aspect
in future research.
The B terms listed in Table 1 are the top ten terms that
were retrieved from a search of the literature for the se-
mantic types Genes or Genomes, Enzymes, and Amino
Acid, Peptide or Proteins. The biochemical effects of cur-
cumin become apparent upon conducting a search of the
literature for curcumin and any of these terms. Curcumin,
for example, has a strong down-regulatory effect on c-
Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (14627502, 12859962,
11370761, 12097302) resulting in the arrest of cell pro-
liferation (14627502) in prostate tumor cells (12853969)
and induction of apoptosis (12859962). Curcumin in-
hibits NF-kappaB (12714587) leading to the suppres-
sion of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis

in multiple myeloma (12393461) and ovary cancer cells
(12520734). TGF-beta1 induced IL-6 which has been im-
plicated in the malignant progression of prostate cancers
was severely impeded by curcumin through inhibition of
c-Jun (matches with Genes, jun in the table) JNK (an in-
stance of MAPK in the table) or AP-1 (12853969).
The curcumin open discovery process terminated with
a ranked list of diseases. Table 2 shows the top 5 entries5.
One observation made at this point was that the type of
automated search conducted in step 5 of the algorithm to
check for novelty is insufficient. At present, the search
involves only the particular MeSH term intersected with
the A topic. We do not yet automatically consider syn-
onyms of the MeSH term. For example for the last entry
in the table, although Ischemic Attack Transient AND
(turmeric OR curcumin OR curcuma) retrieved 0 docu-
ments, the search Ischemia AND (turmeric OR curcumin
OR curcuma) retrieves 17 documents. Hence this entry is
unlikely to be immediately interesting to the user. How-
ever, the top two entries did not retrieve any document
even after searching with different synonyms. Testes is
also unlikely to be interesting since a curcumin search in-
tersected with sperm retrieved many documents. Consid-
ering retrieval set size alone is insufficient. For instance,
curcumin intersected with thyroid retrieved 5 documents.
However, these appear to be peripheral to curcumin?s ef-
fect on thyroid neoplasms focusing more on aspects such
as hypothyroidism and toxicity. Automating query ex-
pansion using synonyms will be the subject of further re-
search.
At this point the user may select entries and peruse the
appropriate literature further to (a) determine the nature
of the relationship between curcumin and the diseases (as
the substance under study could be beneficial or harmful)
and (b) assess the quality of the background knowledge
that may be used to guide further study of curcumin and
the disease. This manual phase may be guided by the

disease with curcumin. Table 3 lists the B terms that
were automatically identified as connecting curcumin and
?Retina?.
In the next section we present such an analysis for
?Retina?. That is, we (the second author) examine the
literature to determine if retinal diseases may be a good
context in which a bioscientist may study curcumin. Our
analysis indicates that indeed there is good evidence sup-
porting the hypothesis of a beneficial role for turmeric in
the context of diabetic retinopathies, ocular inflammation
and glaucoma. Analysis of the other highly-ranked dis-
eases is left for future work.
4 Turmeric - Retinal Diseases Connection
The procedure followed up to this point is ?term-centric?.
That is, we automatically identify statistically interesting
B terms and then generate a ranked list of C terms. We
now present further analysis on the connection between
retinal diseases and curcumin. In some cases reading the
title and abstracts of select records provided sufficient in-
formation. In addition the full text of the document was
available. Our strategy was to examine publications for
biochemical or molecular biology mechanisms. In par-
ticular, we were interested in ascertaining whether any of
the genes noted earlier were also involved in the patho-
physiology of these retinal disorders. We focused on the
genes as the critical links that connect the agent curcumin
to the disorders.
Analysis: The user?s goal is to identify biochemical
pathways potentially connecting retinal diseases and cur-
cumin. Retinal diseases could result from complications
due to diabetes, or of infection and inflammation of the
retina.
Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness.
An early sign of the disease is the adhesion of leukocytes
to the vessels of the retina, endothelial cell injury, and the
breakdown of the blood-retina barrier (12000720). Even
acute intensive insulin therapy constitutes an additional
risk factor for diabetic retinopathy, due to insulin-induced
hypoxia and an associated acceleration in the blood-retina
barrier breakdown (11901189). Glaucoma is the second
most common cause of blindness in the world (8695555)
and is caused by mutations in a number of genes on chro-
mosomes 1 and 10 as well as in other loci on chromo-
somes 2, 3, 8, and 7. While several diseases have one
or a few genetic loci that control disease progression and
familial transmission, it is often the case that a variety of
genes may be involved in their pathophysiology. Follow-
ing is a brief survey of some of the genes that may be
involved in the process of tissue injury or inflammation
and regulation of cell division. Control of the immune
process and of the inflammatory response is important in
combating infection and autoimmune diseases. Regula-
tion of cell division, particularly programmed cell death,
is critical in diverse diseases such as cancer and tissue re-
generation, e.g. retinal injury and diseases. Regulation
of the activity of such genes could provide strategies for
therapeutic intervention using curcumin.
In diabetes and during inflammation, periods of hy-
poxia, i.e. low oxygen concentration, occur in various
tissues and organs. At such times an early cellular re-
sponse results in the elevated expression of interleukin-
1beta (IL-1 beta) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) genes
(11527948, 14507857, 11821258) which in turn stim-
ulate new blood vessel growth leading to retinopathy
(12821538, 12601017). Similarly, the expression of
COX-2 was associated with the development of glau-
coma (9441697). Treatment with COX-2 inhibitors sup-
pressed blood-retinal barrier breakdown and had an an-
tiangiogenic effect, i.e. they prevented the growth of new
blood vessels and thus had a protective effect on the retina
(12821538, 11980873).
Another gene, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-
alpha), was elevated during the early stages of diabetic
retinopathy and inflammation (11821258, 12706995,
11161842). Anti-TNF-alpha treatment reduced leukocyte
adhesion to blood vessels of the eye and vascular leakage
(12714660) indicating a potential therapeutic effect for
such a treatment to reduce ocular inflammation. Activa-
tion of TNF-alpha and other genes may also lead to the
pathophysiology of glaucoma (10975909, 10815159).
The family of mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK) is another group of genes that has an important
role in retinal disease. These include extracellular signal-
regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun amino(N)-terminal ki-
nase (JNK), and p38. One of these, ERK, was induced
in glaucoma (12824248). Often inflammatory responses
include the induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell
death. The involvement of JNK in inducing apop-
tosis was demonstrated in prostate cancer (12859962,
12663665) and retinal cells (12270637). There is also a
link to TNF-alpha (discussed above) which was shown to
activate phosphorylation of ERKs, p38, and JNK MAPK
in human chondrocytes (12878172).
IL-1beta activation, induced by the presence of reti-
nal holes, a key feature of diabetic retinopathy, is also
reported to result in the activation of a number of the
MAPK genes ERK, JNK, and p38 (12824248). These
conditions in turn exacerbate the disease process in that
they result in proliferative and migratory cells accumu-
lating in the wounded retina (12500176). Inhibitors of
MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3) inhibited
retinal pigment epithelial cell proliferation (12782163).
The breakdown in the blood-retina barrier is also sup-
pressed by inhibitors of p38 MAPK and PI3 (11901189).
Changes in the levels of the gene NF-kappaB is an
early cellular response to inflammation. Activation of
TNF-alpha (discussed above) is followed by increased
transcription of NF-kappaB which in turn stimulates
ERK, p38, and JNK MAPK (12878172). Also activa-
tion of NF-kappaB subsequently stimulated COX-2 and
matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression (12807725).
Curcumin was shown to be effective in inhibiting
cell proliferation of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic
breast cancer cells (12527329) and other tumor cells
(12680238). As described previously the gene COX-
2 is involved in early inflammatory diabetic retinopathy
(11821258). Curcumin was able to suppress COX-2 in
a dose-related manner (12844482) and neutralized the
effect of IL-1 beta, possibly through its effect on p38
and COX-2 and JNK (12957788). Curcumin is also a
known inhibitor of JNK (12957788,12854631,12582006,
12130649, 12105223, 9674701) and a suppresser of
NF-kappaB activation (11753638, 11506818, 12878172,
12825130). For example, it suppressed the induction of
NF-kappaB and its dependent genes by cigarette smoke
(12807725), in alcoholic liver disease (12388178) and in
cultured endothelial cells (12368225).
Having shown that these genes, in particular, IL-1beta,
COX-2, TNF-alpha, JNK, ERK, NF-kappaB, etc., are
involved in retinopathy and in regulating cell prolifer-
ation and leukocyte attachment and the breakdown of
the blood-retina barrier, and having established that cur-
cumin is capable of inhibiting the activity of these genes
we hypothesize that curcumin may have therapeutic value
in preventing or ameliorating a number of retinal patholo-
gies.
Our approach has focused on specific genes, in partic-
ular to provide clues regarding the relevant biochemical
pathways. In some cases the evidence is gathered in the
context of other diseases such as alcoholic liver disease
with the idea that similar evidence may be found for reti-
nal diseases. In summary it seems likely that curcumin,
taken in the diet or applied topically, could prove benefi-
cial in cases of diabetic retinopathies, retinal injury, ocu-
lar inflammation and glaucoma.
5 Related Research
Text mining, i.e., uncovering information that may lead
to hypotheses, has attracted the attention of many re-
searchers (eg. Andrade & Valencia, 1998; Gordon
& Lindsay, 1996; Masys et al, 2001; Smalheiser &
Swanson, 1996a; Smalheiser & Swanson, 1996b; Srini-
vasan & Wedemeyer 2003; Srinivasan, 2004; Swanson,
1986; Swanson, 1988; Swanson et al, 2001; Weeber,
2000). Examples of recent text mining applications in-
clude automatically identifying viruses that may be used
as bioweapons (Swanson et al, 2001), proposing ther-
apeutic uses for thalidomide (Weeber, 2003) and find-
ing functional connections between genes (Chaussabel &
Sher, 2002; Shatkay et al, 2000).
A major emphasis in text mining research has been
to directly exploit co-occurrence relationships in MED-
LINE. For example, Jenssen et al, (2001) generate a
co-occurrence based gene network called PubGene from
MEDLINE for 13, 712 named human genes. Each of
PubGene?s 139,756 links is weighted by the number
of times the genes co-occur. Wilkinson and Huber-
man6 identify communities of genes. Starting with a
co-occurrence based gene network for a particular dis-
ease domain, communities are identified by repeatedly re-
moving edges of highest betweeness (number of shortest
paths traversing the edge). Applying this to the domain
of colorectal cancer, they are able to identify interesting
hypotheses linking genes that were for example, in the
same community but had no edge between them.
Our research is based on the open discovery framework
proposed by Swanson. As indicated before, Swanson
and Smalheiser made several discoveries using their open
and closed discovery methods (Swanson, 1986; Swan-
son, 1988; Swanson et al, 2001; Smalheiser & Swan-
son, 1996a; Smalheiser & Swanson, 1996b), that were
later validated by bioscientists. These discoveries to-
gether offer a testbed of examples that are being used
by other researchers to develop their own discovery al-
gorithms (Gordon & Lindsay, 1996; Lindsay & Gordon,
1999; Srinivasan, 2004; Weeber et al, 2001).
One characteristic that may be useful in distinguish-
ing between text mining efforts is the extent to which
they are problem or sub domain specific. For example,
PubGene is directly targeted towards bioinformatics re-

searchers. In contrast, implementations such as ours that
derive from the open discovery framework are not prob-
lem specific. These may be used for a variety of goals, as
for example by geneticists involved in understanding the
results of microarray experiments and by epidemiologists
searching for links between viruses and specific popula-
tions. We believe that the next generation of text mining
systems will be judged not only by their effectiveness but
also by their flexibility in application.
6 Conclusions
We applied our implementation of Swanson?s open dis-
covery algorithm to the problem of identifying novel dis-
ease or problem contexts in which substances might have
a therapeutic role. We used our methods to investigate the
potential of turmeric or Curcumin Longa. Our analysis
identifies a ranked list of problems for which treatment
with curcumin may be beneficial with the top ranked en-
try pointing to retinal diseases. Guided by our algorithm,
further analysis of the literature by our expert user (a ge-
neticist) yielded good evidence in support of the hypoth-
esis that curcumin, taken in the diet or applied topically,
could prove beneficial in cases of diabetic retinopathies,
ocular inflammation and glaucoma.
In future work we will analyze the other suggestions
made by our open discovery methods. For example, the
second suggestion is problems related to the spinal cord.
The analysis will again focus on genetic mechanisms that
could potentially connect curcumin with the problems.
We will also explore methods to automate query expan-
sion for the search in step 5 of the algorithm. One lim-
itation of the discovery process concerns the evidence
gathering phase when analyzing individual C terms. This
process is manual and involves significant investment of
time and intellect toward sifting through the literature and
collecting evidence relevant to the hypothesized connec-
tions. In the next phase of our work we plan to study
methods to assist in this phase.

Abstract 
Researchers in the biomedical and molecular 
biology fields are faced with a wide variety of 
information sources. These are presented in 
the form of images, free text, and structured 
data files that include medical records, gene 
and protein sequence data, and whole genome 
microarray data, all gathered from a variety of 
experimental organisms and clinical subjects. 
The need to organize and relate this informa-
tion, particularly concerning genes,  has moti-
vated the development of resources, such as 
the Unified Medical Language System, Gene 
Ontology, LocusLink, and the Online Inheri-
tance In Man (OMIM) database. We describe 
a natural language processing application to 
extract information on genes from unstruc-
tured text and discuss ways to integrate this 
information with some of the available online 
resources.  
1 Introduction 
The current knowledge explosion in genetics and ge-
nomics poses a challenge to both researchers and medi-
cal practitioners. Traditionally, scientific reviews, which 
summarize and evaluate the literature, have been indis-
pensable in addressing this challenge. OMIM (Online 
Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (OMIM 2000), for ex-
ample, is a clinical and biomedical information resource 
on human genes and genetic disorders. It has close to 
15,000 entries detailing clinical phenotypes and disor-
ders as well as information on nearly 9,000 genes. The 
database can be searched by gene symbol, chromosomal 
location, or disorder. 
More recently, automated techniques for information 
and knowledge extraction from the literature are being 
developed to complement scientific reviews. These 
methods address the need to condense and efficiently 
present large amounts of data to the user.  The feasibil-
ity of applying natural language processing techniques 
to the biomedical literature (Friedman and Hripcsak 
1999; de Bruijn and Martin 2002) and to the wealth of 
genomics data now available (Jenssen et al 2001; Yan-
dell and Majoros 2002) is increasingly being recog-
nized. Efforts to develop systems that work toward this 
goal focus on the identification of such items as gene 
and protein names (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002) or groups 
of genes with similar function (Jenssen et al 2001; 
Masys et al 2001). Other groups are interested in identi-
fying protein-protein (Blaschke et al 1999; Temkin and 
Gilder 2003) or gene-gene interactions (Stephens et al 
2001; Tao et al 2002), inhibit relations (Pustejovsky et 
al. 2002), protein structure (Gaizauskas et al 2003), and 
pathways (Ng and Wong 1999; Friedman et al 2001). 
We discuss the modification of an existing natural 
language processing system, SemGen (Rindflesch et al 
2003), that has broad applicability to biomedical text 
and that takes advantage of online resources such as 
LocusLink and the Gene Ontology. We are pursuing 
research that identifies gene-gene interactions in text on 
genetic diseases. For example the system extracts (2) 
from (1).

with MPP3, one of the human homologues of a 
Drosophila tumor suppressor gene, Discs large 
(Dlg).

Due to the complexity of the language involved, the 
extraction of such predications is currently not accurate 
enough to support practical application. However, we 
suggest its potential in the context of an application that 
combines traditional, human-curated resources such as 
OMIM and emerging information extraction applica-
tions.

3 SemGen 
Molecular Biology Resources 
To support and supplement the information extracted by 
SemGen from biomedical text, we draw on two re-
sources, LocusLink and the Gene Ontology. LocusLink 
(Wheeler et al 2004) provides a single query interface 
to curated genomic sequences and genetic loci. It pre-
sents information on official nomenclature, aliases, se-
quence accessions, phenotypes, OMIM numbers, 
homology, map locations, and related Web sites, among 
others. Of particular interest is the Reference Sequence 
(RefSeq) collection, which provides a comprehensive, 
curated, integrated, non-redundant set of sequences, 
including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA), and protein 
products for major research organisms. Currently, 
SemGen uses LocusLink to obtain normalized gene 
names and Gene Ontology annotations.  
The Gene Ontology (GO) (The Gene Ontology Con-
sortium 2000, 2001, 2004) aims to provide a dynamic 
controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all organ-
isms, even while knowledge of gene and protein func-
tion is incomplete or unfolding. The GO consists of 
three separate ontologies: molecular function, biological 
process, and cellular component. These three branches 
are used to characterize gene function and products and 
provide a comprehensive structure that permits the an-
notation of molecular attributes of genes in various or-
ganisms. We use GO annotations to examine whether 
there are identifiable patterns, or concordance, in the 
function of gene pairs identified by SemGen.  
SemGen identifies gene interaction predications based  
on semantic interpretation adapted from SemRep (Srini-
vasan and Rindflesch 2002; Rindflesch and Fiszman 
2003), a general natural language processing system 
being developed for the biomedical domain. After the 
application of  a statistically-based labeled categorizer 
(Humphrey 1999) that limits input text to the molecular 
biology domain, SemGen processing proceeds in  three 
major phases: categorial analysis, identification of con-
cepts, and identification of relations.  
The initial phase relies on a parser that draws on the 
SPECIALIST Lexicon (McCray et al 1994) and the 
Xerox Part-of-Speech Tagger (Cutting et al 1992) to 
produce an underspecified categorial analysis.  
In the phase for identifying concepts, disorders as 
well as genes and proteins are isolated by mapping sim-
ple noun phrases from the previous phase to concepts in 
the Unified Medical Language System? (UMLS)? 
Metathesaurus? (Humphreys et al 1998), using 
MetaMap (Aronson 2001). ABGene, a program that 
identifies genes and proteins using several statistical and 
empirical methods (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002) is also 
consulted during this phase. In addition, a small list of 
signal words (such as gene, codon, and exon) helps 
identify genetic phenomena. For example, the genetic 
phenomena in (4) are identified from the sentence in (3). 
Concepts isolated in this phase serve as potential argu-
ments in the next phase.  
3) WIF1 was down-regulated in 64% of primary 
prostate cancers, while SFRP4 was up-regulated 
in 81% of the patients. 
4) genphenom|WIF1  
genphenom|SFRP4 
 
During the final phase, in which relations are identi-
fied, the predicates of semantic propositions are based 
on indicator rules. These stipulate verbs, nominaliza-
tions, and prepositions that ?indicate? semantic predi-
cates. During this phase, argument identification is 
constrained by an underspecified dependency grammar, 
which also attempts to accommodate coordinated argu-
ments as well as predicates.  
SemGen originally had twenty rules indicating one 
of three etiology relations between genetic phenomena 
and diseases, namely CAUSE, PREDISPOSE, and 
ASSOCIATED_WITH. In this project, we extended Sem-
Gen to cover gene-gene interaction relations: INHIBIT, 
STIMULATE, AND INTERACT_WITH. About 20 indicator 
rules were taken from MedMiner (Tanabe et al 1999). 
We supplemented this list by taking advantage of the 
verbs identified in syntactic predications by GeneScene 
(Leroy et al 2003). SemGen has 46 gene-gene interac-
tion indicator rules (mostly verbs), including 16 for 
INHIBIT (such as block, deplete, down-regulate); 12 for 
INTERACT_WITH (bind, implicate, influence, mediate); 
and 18 for STIMULATE (amplify, activate, induce, up-
regulate).  
An overview of the SemGen system is given in Fig-
ure 1, and an example is provided below. SemGen proc-
essing on input text (5) produces the underspecified 
syntactic structure (represented schematically) in (6). 
(7) illustrates genetic phenomena identified, and (8) 
shows the final semantic interpretation.

During processing, SemGen normalizes gene sym-

shown in (9).

As we retrieve the LocusLink symbol for a gene, we 
also get the GO terms associated with that gene. We are 
interested in extending the application of our textual 
analysis and knowledge extraction methodology and 
relating it to other biomedical and genomic resources. 
Gene Ontology is one such important resource, and be-
low we discuss the possibility that GO might shed addi-
tional light on the biological relationship between genes 
that are paired functionally based on textual analysis. 
The GO terms for the genes in (9) are given in (10) and 
(11).

scription, DNA-dependent; signal transduction;

4 SemGen Evaluation and Error Analysis 
Before suggesting an application using SemGen output, 
we discuss the results of error analysis performed on 
344 sentences from MEDLINE citations related to six 
genetic diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Crohn?s disease, 
lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and sickle 
cell anemia. Out of 442 predications identified by Sem-
Gen, 181 were correct, for 41% precision. This is not 
yet accurate enough to support a production system; 
however, the majority of the errors are focused in two 
syntactic areas, and we believe that with further devel-
opment it is possible to provide output effective for 
supporting practical applications. 
The majority of the errors fall into one of two major 
syntactic classes, relativization and coordination. A fur-
ther source of error is the fact that we have not yet ad-
dressed interaction relations that involve a process in 
addition to a gene.  
Reduced relative clauses, such as mediated by Tip60 
in (12), are a rich source of argument identification er-
rors.  
12) LRPICD dramatically inhibits APP-derived in-
tracellular domain/Fe65 transactivation medi-
ated by Tip60.  
SemGen wrongly interpreted this sentence as asserting 
that LRPICD inhibits Tip60. The rules of the under-
specified dependency grammar that identify arguments 
essentially look to the left and right of a verb for a noun 
phrase that has been marked as referring to a genetic 
phenomenon. Arguments are not allowed to be used in 
more than one predication (unless licensed by coordina-
tion or as the head of a relative clause).  
A number of phenomena conspire in (12) to wrongly 
allow TIP60  to be analyzed as the object of inhibits. 
The actual object, transactivation, was not recognized 
because we have not yet addressed processes as argu-
ments of gene interaction predications. Further, the 
predication on transactivation, with argument TIP60, 
was not interpreted, and hence TIP60 was available (in-
correctly) for the object of inhibits.  If we had recog-
nized the relative clause in (12), TIP60 would not have 
been reused as an argument of inhibits, since only heads 
of relative clauses can be reused. 
The underspecified analysis on which SemGen is 
based is not always effective in identifying verb phrase 
coordination, as in (13), leading to the incorrect inter-
pretation that WIF1 interacts with SFRP4. 
13) WIF1 was down-regulated in 64% of primary 
prostate cancers, while SFRP4 was up-regulated 
in 81% of the patients.  
A further source of error in this sentence is that 
down-regulated was analyzed by the tagger as a past 
tense rather than past participle, thus causing the argu-
ment identification phase to look for an object to the 
right of this verb form. A further issue here is that we 
have not yet addressed truncated passives.  
5 Using SemGen to Compare OMIM and 
MEDLINE  
SemGen errors notwithstanding, we are investigating 
possibilities for exploiting automatically extracted gene 
interaction predications. We discuss an application 
which compares MEDLINE text to OMIM documents, 
for specified diseases. LocusLink preferred gene sym-
bols and GO terms are an integral part of this process-
ing. We feel it is instructive to investigate the 
consequences of this comparison, anticipating results 
that are effective enough for practical application. 
We selected five diseases with a genetic component 
(Alzheimer?s disease, Crohn?s disease, lung cancer, 
prostate cancer, and sickle cell anemia), and retrieved 
the corresponding OMIM report for each disease, auto-
matically discarding sections such as references, head-
ings, and edit history. We also queried PubMed for each 
disease and retrieved all MEDLINE citations that were 
more recent than the corresponding OMIM report. Both 
OMIM and MEDLINE files were then submitted to 
SemGen.  
For each disease, the MEDLINE file was larger than 
the corresponding OMIM file, and the categorizer 
eliminated some parts of each file as not being in the 
molecular biology domain. Table 1 shows the number 
of sentences in the original input files and the number 
processed after the categorizer eliminated sentences not 
in the molecular biology domain.

A paragraph in the OMIM file for Alzheimer?s dis-
ease beginning with the sentence Alzheimer disease is 
by far the most common cause of dementia, for example, 
was eliminated, while a MEDLINE citation with the 
title Semantic decision making in early probable AD: A 
PET activation study was removed.   
An overview of predication types retrieved by Sem-
Gen is given in Table 2 for the files on Alzheimer?s 
disease. Of the gene-disease predications, the majority 
had predicate ASSOCIATED_WITH (15 from OMIM and 
25 from MEDLINE). For gene-gene relations, 
INTERACT_WITH predominated (3 from OMIM and 12 
from MEDLINE).

Table 2. Gene interaction predication types 
 
We developed a program that compares semantic 
predications found in MEDLINE abstracts to those 
found in an OMIM report associated with a particular 
disease and classifies the comparison between two 
predications as either an exact match, partial match, or 
no match. The category of a comparison is determined 
by examining the argument and predicate fields of the 
predications. If all three fields match, the comparison is 
an exact match; if any two fields match it is a partial 
match. All other cases are considered as no match.  
Although fewer than half of the predications ex-
tracted by SemGen are likely to be correct, we provide 
some examples from the files on Alzheimer?s disease.  
(The system retains the document ID?s, which are sup-
pressed here for clarity.) Examples of partial matches 
between gene-disease predications extracted from 
OMIM and MEDLINE are shown in (14) and (15).

Some of the gene-disease predications that only oc-
curred in OMIM are given in (16), and a few of those 
occurring exclusively in MEDLINE are given in (17).

predications found in MEDLINE but not in OMIM.

6 Using the GO Terms  
As noted above, for each gene argument in the predica-
tions identified by SemGen, we retrieved from Locus-
Link the GO terms associated with that gene. We have 
begun to investigate ways in which these terms might be 
used to compare genes by looking at the gene-gene in-
teraction predications extracted from MEDLINE that 
did not occur in OMIM.  
To support this work, we developed a program that 
sorts gene-gene interaction predications by the GO 
terms of their arguments. For each gene function, the 
predications in which both arguments share the same 
function are listed first. These are followed by the 
predications in which only the first argument has that 
gene function, and then the predications in which only 
the second argument has the relevant gene function. A 
typical output file of this process is shown in (19): 
 
19) RECEPTOR ACTIVITY 
        ----------------- 
        Both Arguments: 
        DTR|STIMULATE|EGFR 
        First Argument: 
        AR|STIMULATE|TRXR3 
        EPHB2|STIMULATE|ENO2 
        Second Argument: 
        EGR1|INTERACT_WITH|AR 
        PSMC6|STIMULATE|AR 
 
The three branches of the Gene Ontology provide a 
uniform system for relating genes by function. The 
terms in the molecular function and biological process 
branches are perhaps most useful for this purpose; how-
ever, we have begun by considering all three branches 
(including the cellular component branch). The most 
effective method of exploiting GO annotations remains 
a matter of research.  
It is important to recognize that GO mapping is not 
precise; different annotators may make different GO 
assignments for the same gene. Nevertheless, GO anno-
tations provide considerable potential for relating the 
molecular functions and biological processes of genes. 
We consider one of the predications extracted from the 
MEDLINE file for prostate cancer that did not occur in 
OMIM: 
19) EGR1|INTERACT_WITH|AR 
Both genes EGR1 and AR in LocusLink elicit the 
same human gene set (367 Hs AR; 1026 Hs CDKN1A; 
1958 Hs EGR1; 3949 Hs LDLR; 4664 Hs NAB1; 4665 
Hs NAB2; 5734 Hs PTGER4; 114034 Hs TOE1). This 
suggests a high degree of sequence homology and func-
tional similarity. In addition, LocusLink provides the 
following GO terms for the two genes: 
20) EGR1: early growth response 1; LocusID: 1958 
Gene Ontology: transcription factor activity; 
regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent; 
nucleus  
21)  AR: androgen receptor (dihydrotestosterone re-
ceptor; testicular feminization; spinal and bulb 
ar muscular atrophy; Kennedy disease) ; Lo-
cusID: 367 Gene Ontology:  androgen receptor 
activity; steroid binding; receptor activity; tran-
scription factor activity; transport; sex differen-
tiation; regulation of transcription, DNA-
dependent; signal transduction; cell-cell signal-
ing; nucleus 
(The GO provides additional, hierarchical information 
for terms, which we have not yet exploited.) 
Thirty percent of the predications examined had 
some degree of overlap in their GO terms. For example, 
the terms for EGR1 (transcription factor activity; regu-
lation of transcription, DNA- dependent; and nucleus) 
are identical to three of the GO terms for the AR gene. 
This concordance may not be typical of the majority of 
paired genes in our sample. However, in the case of 
genes that do not exhibit such complete overlap, con-
cordance might be obtained at higher nodes in the clas-
sification scheme. 
An alternate approach for assessing distance be-
tween GO annotations has been suggested by Lord et al 
(2003a, 2003b). They propose a ?semantic similarity 
measure? using ontologies to explore the relationships 
between genes that may have associated interaction or 
function. The authors consider the information content 
of each GO term, defined as the number of times each 
term, or any child term, occurs. 
The fact that any one gene has a number of GO an-
notations indicates that a particular gene may perform 
more than one function or its function may be classified 
under a number of molecular activities. Some of these 
activities may be part of, i.e. extending to a variable 
degree down, the same GO structure. For example, for 
gene AR, ?receptor activity? (GO 4872) partially over-
laps with ?androgen receptor activity? (GO 4882), as 
does ?steroid binding? (GO 5496) with ?transcription 
factor activity? (GO 3700), and ?signal transduction 
(GO 7165) and ?cell-cell signaling (GO 7267). This 
indicates that in assessing similarity one needs to exam-
ine the ontology structure and not rely solely on the GO 
terms.  
While we have no experimental evidence, we would 
like to speculate about the functional or biological sig-
nificance indicated by similarity in GO annotation. 
There are three orthogonal aspects to GO: molecular 
function, biological process, and cellular component. If 
two genes map more closely in one of the taxonomies, 
then their function is necessarily more closely related. 
The majority of GO terms are in the molecular function 
taxonomy. It is conceivable that genes that map more 
closely could be involved in the same cascade or par-
ticipate in the same genetic regulatory network. There is 
increasing interest in genetic networks (e.g. 
www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ kegg2.html; http://ecocyc.org; 
http://us.expasy.org/tools/pathways; www.biocarta.com) 
and combining the ability to search and extract informa-
tion from the literature with GO mapping could prove 
effective in elucidating the functional interactions of 
genes.

8 Conclusion 
Potential Knowledge Discovery 
To determine whether our automatic comparison of 
MEDLINE to OMIM based on SemGen predications 
might throw new light on  gene-gene interactions, we 
examined predications found in the MEDLINE file that 
had no match in the OMIM file. We searched the 
OMIM reports for information on the genes found in 
such predications to confirm that they were absent from 
the OMIM reports. For example, while the OMIM re-
port on colon cancer did not mention BARD1, the 
SemGen output for MEDLINE had   
22) BARD1|INTERACT_WITH|hmsh2 
The abstract containing this predication (PMID 
11498787) asserts that the BARD1 gene (LocusID 580) 
interacts with the breast cancer gene BRCA1 as well as 
with hMSH2, a mismatch repair gene associated with 
colon cancer.  BARD1 shares homology with the two 
conserved regions of BRCA1 and also interacts with the 
N-terminal region of BRCA1. Interaction of BARD1 
with BRCA1 could be essential for the function of 
BRCA1 in tumor suppression.  
Conversely, disruption of this interaction may possi-
bly contribute to the process of oncogenesis. It has been 
reported that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is responsi-
ble for many of the tumor suppression activities of 
BRCA1 (Baer and Ludwig 2002). The gene hMSH2 
(LocusID 4436) is one of a number of genes that, when 
mutated, predisposes to colon cancer type 1. It is the 
human homolog of the bacterial mismatch repair gene 
mutS. We hypothesize that the interaction of BARD1 
with hMSH2, in a similar fashion to BRCA1, may be 
necessary for tumor suppression. Disruption of this in-
teraction may increase the likelihood of developing co-
lon cancer. Furthermore, this observation serves to point 
toward a possible link between BRCA1 and colon can-
cer. 
 
We have extended earlier work with SemGen (Rind-
flesch et al 2003) and are now able to extract from text, 
in addition to names of gene and disorders, gene-
disorder and gene-gene relations. Although SemGen is 
not at a stage where it can be used indiscriminately and 
without selective review and evaluation, it may never-
theless prove useful for reviewers by providing an effi-
cient means of scanning a large number of references 
and extracting relations involving genes and diseases. 
The process of curation and review is time consum-
ing. Given the rate at which new publications are added 
to the scientific literature, the availability of tools for 
accelerating the review process would meet a real need. 
As demonstrated by our pilot study on six disorders, 
SemGen could prove useful, even at this prototype 
stage, in extracting relevant information from the litera-
ture concerning genes and diseases. Additionally, the 
ability to scan and extract information from diverse sci-
entific domains could play an important role in identify-
ing new relationships between genes and diseases that 
would promote hypothesis-generation and advance sci-
entific research. Even with the present limitations, 
SemGen could assist in making the scientific literature 
more accessible and reduce the time it takes for re-
searchers to update their knowledge and expertise.
