Abstract
Microblogs are a popular way for users to communicate and have recently caught the attention
of researchers in the natural language processing (NLP) field. However, regardless of their rising
popularity, little attention has been given towards determining the properties of discourse rela-
tions for the rapid, large-scale microblog data. Therefore, given their importance for various NLP
tasks, we begin a study of discourse relations on microblogs by focusing on evidence relations.
As no annotated corpora for evidence relations on microblogs exist, we conduct a corpus study
to identify such relations on Twitter, a popular microblogging service. We create annotation
guidelines, conduct a large-scale annotation phase, and develop a corpus of annotated evidence
relations. Finally, we report our observations, annotation difficulties, and data statistics.
1 Introduction
Microblogs have become a popular method for users to express their ideas and communicate with other
users. Twitter
1
, a popular microblogging service, has recently been the attraction of many natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tasks ranging from flu epidemic detection (Aramaki et al., 2011) to gender
inference for its users (Ciot et al., 2013). While various tasks are available, despite its daily, rapid large-
scale data, evidence relation studies have yet to be explored using Twitter data. Previous research exists
for determining the credibility of information on Twitter (Castillo et al., 2011); however, the focus of this
work is to determine and annotate evidence relations on microblogs.
Our primary motivation behind focusing on evidence relations includes the possibility of discovering
support for a claim which can support the debunking of false information. During the March 2011
Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami disaster, victims turned to the Internet in order to obtain
information on current conditions, such as family member whereabouts, refuge center information, and
general information (Sakaki et al., 2011). However, false information, such as the popular Cosmo Oil
explosion causing toxic rain, interfered with those looking to find correct information on the status of
the disaster areas (Okazaki et al., 2013). This is a scenario in which identification of potentially false
information is necessary in order to provide accurate information to victims and others relying on and
trusting in the Internet. Therefore, as a start to find support for counterclaims for false information such
as the Cosmo Oil explosion, we focus on dialogue between two individuals: a topic starter, or a post
with no parent; and a respondent who provides either an agreeing or disagreeing claim and support for
their claim. An example is provided in Figure 1.
We note that our task can appear similar to the field of Why-QA (Verberne, 2006; Oh et al., 2013;
Mrozinski et al., 2008), which attempts to discover the answer for Why questions. Given our task of
discovering agreeing or conflicting claims, and finding specific reasoning to support the claim, we end
up with a Why question similar to Why is it true/not true that X, where X is the contents of the claim
found in the parent post. However, we consider source mentions or hyperlinks, which can either stand
alone or be contained in a statement, question, or request, as a way to answer the above question.
To the best of our knowledge, no corpora for evidence relations on microblogs currently exists. In
terms of argumentation corpora, the Araucaria Argumentation Corpus
2
exists which utilizes various
argumentation schemes (Walton, 1996; Katzav and Reed, 2004; Pollock, 1995). In this work, we
