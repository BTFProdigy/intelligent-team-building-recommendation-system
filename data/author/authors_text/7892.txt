Abstract
As electronic communications is now increasing, the term Natural Language Processing should be
considered in the broader aspect of Multi-Language processing system. Observation of the language
behavior will provide a good basis for design of computational language model and also creating cost-
effective solutions to the practical problems. In order to have a good language modeling, the language
resources are necessary for the language behavior analysis.
This paper intended to express what we have and what we have done by the desire to make a bridge
between the languages and to share and make maximal use of the existing lexica, corpus and the tools.
Three main topics are, then, focussed: A State of the Art of Thai language Resources, Thai language
behaviors and their computational models.
1. Introduction
As electronic communications are now
increasing, the term Natural Language Processing
should be considered in the broader aspect of
Multi- Language Processing system. An important
phase in the system development process is
requirement engineering, which can define as the
process of analyzing the problems in a certain
language. An essential part of the requirement-
engineering phase is computational language
modeling which is an abstract representation of
the behavior of the language.  In order to have a
good language model for creating cost-effective
solutions to the practical problems, the language
resources are necessary for the language behavior
analysis.
This paper intended to express what we
have and what we have done by the desire to
make a bridge between the languages and to
share and make maximal use of the existing
lexica, corpus and the tools. Three main topics
are, then, focussed:
? A State of the Art of Thai language
Resources that will give an overview of what we
have in Corpus, Lexicon and tools for corpus
processing and analysis.
? Thai language behaviors (only in word
and phrase level) analyzed from the varieties
of corpus which consist of Lexicon growth,
New word formation and Phrase/Sentence
construction, and
?  The computational models providing
for those behaviors, which consist of Unknown
Word Extraction and Name Entities identification,
New word generation and Noun phrase
recognition.
The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. In section 2, we give the gateway of Thai
language resources.  Thai Language behaviors are
discussed in section 3. In section 4, then, provides
Thai Language Computational Modeling as a
basis for creating cost-effective solutions to those
practical problems.
2. A State of the Art of Thai Language
Resource
 This section gives a survey of a state of the
art of Thai Language Resources consisting of
Corpus, Lexicon and Tools. Here, we will present
only the resources that open for public access.
2.1 Corpus
The existing Thai corpus is divided into 2 
types; speech and text corpus developed by many 
Thai Universities. Thai Language Audio Resource 
Center of Thammasart University (ThaiARC) 
(http:// thaiarc.ac.th) developed speech corpus 
aimed to provide digitized audio information for 
dissemination via Internet. The project pioneers 
the production and collection of various types of 
audio information and various styles of Thai 
speech, such as royal speeches, academic lectures, 
oral literature, etc.
For Text corpus, originally, the goal of the 
corpus collecting is used only inside the 
laboratory.  Until 1996, National Electronics and 
Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) and 
Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) had 
a collaboration project with the purpose of 
preparing Thai language corpus from technical 
proceedings for language study and application 
research. It named ORCHID corpus (NECTEC, 
1997). NAiST Corpus began in 1996 with the 
primary aim of collecting document from 
magazines for training and testing program in 
Written Production Assistance (Asanee, 1995). 
The existing corpus can be summarized as shown 
in Table 1.

From the table 2, Only Lexitron (from
NECTEC) and NAiST Lexibase (from Kasetsart
University) that were applied to NLP. NAiST
Lexibase has been developed based on relational
model for managing and maintaining easily in the
future. It contains 15,000 words list with their
syntax and the semantic concept information in
the concept code.
2.3 Corpus and Language Analysis
Tools
Corpus is not only the resource of Linguistic 
Knowledge but is used for training, improving and 
evaluating the NLP systems. The tools for corpus 
manipulation and knowledge acquisition become 
necessary.
NAiST Lab. has developed the toolkit for 
sharing via the Internet. It has been designed for 
corpus collecting, annotating, maintaining and 
analyzing. Additionally, it has been designed as 
the engine, which the end user could use with their 
data. (See a service on http://naist.cpe.ku.ac.th).
3. Thai Language Behavior Analysis
In order to have a good language model for
creating cost-effective solutions to the practical
problems in application development, language
behavior must be observed. Next is Thai language
behavior analysis based on NAiST corpus
consisting of Lexicon growth, Thai word
formation and Phrase construction.
3.1 Lexicon Growth
The lexicon growth is studied by using Word 
list Extraction tool to extract word lists from a 
large-scale corpus and mapping to the Royal 
Institute Dictionary (RID). It is noticeable that 
there are two types of lexicon: common and 
unknown words. The common word lists are some 
words in RID, which occur in almost every 
document, and use in daily life. They are primitive 
c3c4c5
c1c2c3c4c5
c1c2
c4c5c1c2c3
words but not being proper names or colloquial 
words. The unknown or new words occur much in 
the real document such as Proper names, 
Colloquial words, Abbreviations, and Foreign 
words.
The lexicon growth is observed from corpus 
size, 400,000, 2,154,700 and 60,511,974 words 
from Newspaper, Magazine and Agriculture text. 
We found that common word lists increased from 
111,954 to 839,522 and 49,136,408 words 
according to the corpus size, while the unknown 
word lists increased from 288,046 to 1,315,178 
and 11,375,566 words respectively as shown in 
table3.

60,511,974 49,136,408 11,375,566
Regarding to 60,511,974 words corpus in the 
table 3, it composes of 35,127,012 words from 
Newspaper, 18,359,724 words from Magazine and 
7,025,238 words from Agricultural Text. 
Unknown words occur in each category as shown 
in table 4.

according to the various corpus genres

Foreign words 304,519 239,107 3,399,670
Total 5,242,123 1,563,697 4,569,746
According to table 3 and 4, we could observe that 
not only unknown words increase but common 
words also increase and the main categories of 
increasing unknown word are proper names and 
foreign words. Consequently, a computational 
model of unknown word extraction and name 
entity identification has been developed and also 
of new word construction.
3.2 New Word Formation and Core
Noun
Regarding to the growth of common word
shown in table 3, we studied how the new words
come from.
3.2.1 Basic Information about Thai
Thai words are multi-syllabic words which
stringing together could form a new word. Since
Thai has no inflection and no word delimiters,
Thai morphological processing is mainly to
recognize word boundaries instead of recognizing
a lexical form from a surface form as in English.
Let  C  be a sequence of characters
C  = c1c2c3?cn : n>=1
Let  W  be a sequence of words
W = w1w2w3?wm : m>=1
Where wi = c1ic2i?ci r: i>=1, r>=2
Since Thai sentences are formed with a
sequence of words with a stream of characters,
i.e., c1c2c3?cn mostly without explicit
delimiters, the word boundary in ?c1c2c3c4c5?
pattern as shown below could have two
ambiguous forms. One is ?c1c2? and  ?c3c4c5?.
The other one is  ?c1c2c3? and  ?c4c5?
(Kawtrakul, 1997)

??(fold one's arms across the chest)?

that the sentence with 45 chara
combinations of words sequence.
3.2.2 New word construction
Almost all-Thai new words ar
means of compounding and nomi
using a set of prefixes.
3.2.2.1 Nominalization
Nominalization is a process by 
can be formed as a noun by using p
Noun words formed by using prefix
and ?????(khwa:m)?are nouns which 
action. Words formed by using pref
????(t?ha:w)?  and ????(nak)?are noun
human or profession.
Prefix ? ???(ka:n)? ? ????(khwa:m

es ????(ka:n)?

ixes ????(phu:)?
s which signal
)?  are used in
 verb or verb
phrase and sometimes from noun
(Nominalization). ???(ka:n) that co-occur with
noun, represents the meaning about duty or
function of noun it relates to. ???(ka:n) that co-
occur with verbs, always occur with action verbs.
????(khwa:m) always co-occur with state verbs.
Prefix ? ???(phu:) ? ? ???(nak)? and ????(t?ha:w)?
are used in the process of new word formation. ???
(phu:)  and ???(nak) co-occur with verb phrase. ???
(nak) sometimes can occur with a few fields of
nouns, such as sport and music. So at the first time
we kept words, which constructed from prefix ????
(nak)? plus noun in the lexicon for solving the
problem. Prefix ????(t?ha:w)? can co-occur with
noun only.
3.2.2.2 Compounding
Thai new words can, also, be combined to
form compound nouns and are invented almost
daily. They normally have at least two parts. The
first part represents a pointed object or person
such as ??(man), ????(pot), ???(tail), ???(plant). The
second part identifies what kind of object or
person it is, or what its purpose is like ?????(drive a
car), ???????(cook rice), ????(tiger), ??? ?(water). Table 5
shows the examples of compound noun in Thai.
Table 5: The Examples of Thai Compound Noun
What or who What type / what purpose
??(man) ?????(drive a car),
????(pot) ???????(cook rice)
???(tail) ????(tiger)
???(plant) ??? ?(water)
Table 6 shows the patterns of compound noun.

From Table 6, it has shown that some
compound nouns maintain some parts of those
primitive word meaning but some changed to a
new meaning. In this paper, we are only interested
in compound noun grouping from primitive words
which were changed the meaning to more abstract
but still maintain some parts of those primitive
word meanings, e.g. ?????(driver) ??????(cooker)
etc.? The word ???? maintains its meaning which
has a concept of human, but when it was
compounded with ???(car)? and ?????(kitchen)?,
their meanings have changed to the occupation by
the word relation in the equivalent level. In case of
compound noun that change a whole meaning
such as ???????? (a boy scout)?, it will be kept in the
lexicon.
3.2.2.3 Compound noun extraction problems
There are three non-trivial problems
? Compound Noun VS Sentence Distinction
? Compound Noun Boundary Ambiguity
? Core noun Detection
Compound Noun VS Sentence
Several NP structures have the same pattern as
sentences. Since Thai language is flexible and has
no word derivation, including to preposition in
compound noun can be omitted, etc. This causes a
compound noun having the same pattern as
sentence.  Thus, Thai NP analysis in IR system is
more difficult than English. (See Figure 2)
Figure 2: The comparison of noun phrase and
sentence structure
In figure 2, compound noun ????????????? (a
dining table) actually omit the preposition ??? ?????
(for)?, which is a relation that point to the purpose
of the first noun ?????(table)?.
The Compound Noun Boundary Ambiguity
After we have extracted noun phrase aiming
for enhancing the IR system, we have to segment
Sentence: ??????????   (birds eat fruit)
In Thai: ?? ??? ?????
 Birds eat fruit
Syntactic cn          tv cn
Category
Compound Noun: ??????????? (a dining table)
In Thai: ????(?? ?????) ??? ????
table  eat rice
Syntactic cn  tv cn
Category 
that noun phrase into sub noun phrase or
compound noun in order to specify the core noun
as index and its modifier as sub-index. For
example, compound noun with ?noun + noun +
verb? structure: ????(child/N)??(hair/N)??? (long/V)
etc. In this case, the second noun and verb have to
be grouped firstly since it behaves similarly to a
modifier by omitting the relative pronoun that
represents its purpose, i.e., ?who has?.
Another case of Compound Noun Boundary
Ambiguity is word combination. Consider the
sequence of words as the example of NP that
composes of four words as follows:
NP = N1N2N3N4
There are 8 word combinations of compound
noun as shown in figure 3.
In figure 3, word string has to be grouped
correctly for the correct meaning.
The ambiguity of noun phrase boundary has
also directly effected the efficiency of text
retrieval.
Core Noun detection
Due to the Information Retrieval, a head or
core of noun phrase detection is necessary. In this
paper, core noun refers to the most important and
specific word that the information retrieval and
extraction can directly retrieve or extract without
over generating candidate words.  However, by
the observation, the core of noun phrase needs not
to be the initial words. Some of them are at the
final position and some have word relation in the
equivalent level (As shown in Table 7).
Table 7: The examples of core noun in NP
Noun phrase(NP) Core noun
     W1              W2
????????? + ??????
structure   +  sentence
  W1       W2
???   +   ?? ??
stain        annual ring
W1        W2         W3
?? + ?????? + ???
fruit     papaya    green
be W1 located at the initial position
be W2 located at the final position
be W2 located at the second
position
As mentioned above, the models of New Word
Generation and Noun Phrase Recognition become
one of the interesting works in Thai processing.
3.3 Phrase and Sentence Construction
Next, we will indicate the main problems that 
influence to MT, IE and IR system. These are 
constituent movement, zero anaphora and iterative 
relative clause.
3.3.1 Constituent Movement
      Constituent is the relationship between lexicon 
units, which are parts of a larger unit. 
Constituency is usually shown by a tree diagram 
or by square brackets:
Ex.      [[???????????????????]  [????????????]]
         [[meeting committee] [very smoothly]].
Constituent acts as a chunk that can be moved 
together and it often occurs in Thai language (see 
Fig. 4). The constituents can be moved to the 
front, the middle or the end of the sentence.
S =
Figure 4 The movements of constituent
Ex.:      ???????  ????????  ???????  ?????
In the morning, the fisherman goes to catch the fish
????????  ???????  ?????  ???????
The fisherman goes to catch the fish in the morning.
????????  ???????  ???????  ?????
The fisherman goes to in the morning, catch the fish
???????  ?????  ????????  ???????
In the morning, catch the fish, the fisherman goes to.
Noun, adverb, and prepositional phrase are 
often move while verb phrases are.
3.3.2 Zero Anaphora
To make the cohesion in the discourse, the 
anaphora is used as a reference to ?point back? to 
some entities called referent or antecedent, given 
in the preceding discourse. Halliday, M.A.K. and 
Hasan, Rugaiya (1976) divided cohesion in 
English into 5 categories as shown in Table 8:
Table 8: Categories of anaphora
Reference - Personal Reference, Demonstrative 
Reference, Comparative Reference
Substitution - Nominal Substitution, Verbal Substitution, 
Causal Substitution
Ellipsis - Nominal Ellipsis, Verbal Ellipsis, Causal 
Ellipsis
Conjunction - Additive, Adversative, Casual, Temporal
Lexical Cohesion - Reiteration(Repetition, Synonym or Near 
Synonym, Super ordinate, General word)
- Collocation
Figure 3: Patterns of noun phrase analysis
C1 C2 C3 C4
Observing from the corpus in: news, magazine 
and agricultural text, there are 4 types of 
anaphora. Ellipsis or zero anaphora was found 
most frequently in Thai documents and other 
anaphora happened as show in table 9.
Table 9: Types of reference
Type of Anaphora Magazine news agriculture
Zero anaphora 49.88% 52.38% 50.04%
repetition 32.04% 27.78% 34.49%
personal reference 12.18% 12.70% 1.87%
nominal substitution 5.90% 6.08% 13.60%
Zero anaphora is the use of a gap, in a phrase 
or clause that has an anaphoric function similar to 
a pro-form. It is often described as ?referring 
back? to an expression that supplies the 
information necessary for interpreting the gap
The following is a sentence that illustrates 
zero anaphora:
????????????????????   ????????? ???????????????????
? There are two roads to eternity, straight 
but narrow, and broad but crooked.
In this sentence, the gaps in straight but 
narrow [gap], and broad but crooked [gap] have 
a zero anaphoric relationship to two roads to 
eternity.
Table 10 also shows the occurrence of zero 
anaphora in various parts of a sentence.
Table 10: Position of reference in sentences
Position Frequency
Subject 49.88%
Object 32.04%
Possessive Pronoun 12.18%
Following a Preposition 5.90%
It is noticeable that zero anaphora in the 
position of the subject occurs with high frequency 
(49.88%). It shows that in Thai language, the 
position of subject is the most commonly 
replaced.
3.3.3 Iterative Relative Clause
Thai relative pronouns ????? (thi) ?????(sung)? and ?
???(un)?  relate to group of nouns or other pronouns 
(The student  ????? (thi)  studies hardest usually does 
the best.). The word  ????? (thi) connects or relates 
the subject, student, to the verb within the 
dependent clause (studies). Generally, we use ?????
(thi)  and  ? ?????(sung)? to introduce clauses that are 
parenthetical in nature (i.e., that can be removed 
from the sentence without changing the essential 
meaning of the sentence. The pronoun ????? (thi) and ?????(sung)? refers to things and people and ????(un)?
usually refers to things, but it can also refer to 
event in general.
The relative pronoun is sometimes omitted 
because it makes the sentence more efficient and 
elegant.? ???????    ???/????    ???     ????????   ??? ????????  ?????????????? 2
???????
The book that you ordered from that shop arrived two days
later.
Sometimes relative pronoun refers to an event 
that takes place repeatedly in a phrase.
Figure 5 The structure of relative clause
Ex.    [???????]N  [(???) ??????????????? ??????]Rel Cl.
         [The chef] [who won the cooking competition]
[(????) ????????????????????????] Rel Cl.   [(???) ?????????] Rel Cl.
        [which compete at France]              [that I employ]
Although a sentence, which has several
clauses inside, will be grammatical, but it is not a
good style in writing and always causes a problem
for parser and noun phrase recognition.
4. The Computational Model
The computational models in word and phrase
level are developed according to the phenomena
mentioned in section 3.
4.1 Unknown Word Extraction
Unknown word extraction model composes of
2 sub-modules: unknown word recognition and
name entity identification.
4.1.1 Unknown word recognition
The hybrid model approach has been used for
unknown word recognition. The approach is the
combination of a statistical model and a set of
context based rules. A statistical model is used to
identify unknown word?s boundary. The set of
context based rules, then, will be used to extract
the unknown word?s semantic concept. If the
unknown word has no context, a set of unknown
word information, which has defined through
corpus analysis, will be generated and the best one
will be selected, as its semantic concept, by using
the semantic tagging model. Unknown word
recognition process is shown in figure 6.

4.1.2 Name Entity Identification
After unknown words have been extracted,
Named Entity (NE) Identification will define the
category of unknown word. The model based on
heuristic rules and mutual information. Mutual
information or statistical analysis of word
collocation is used to solve boundary ambiguity
when names were composed with known and
unknown words. We use Knowledge based such
as list of known name (such as country names),
clue word list (such as person?s title) to support
the heuristic rules. Using clue word or common
noun that precedes the name can specify NE
categorization. Based on the case grammar, NE
categories can also defined. Moreover, the lists of
the names from predefined NE Ontology can be
used for predicting category too. The overview of
our system is shown in figure 7. More detail sees
(Chanlekha, H. et al 2002)
4.2 New Word Generation
Word formation is proposed to reduce the
lexicon size by constructing new words or
compound noun from the existing words. Based
on word formation rules and common dictionary,
the shallow parser will extract a set of candidate
compound nouns. Then probabilistic approach
based on syntactic structure and statistical data is
used to solve the problem of over- and under-
generation of new word construction and prune
the erroneous of compound noun from the
candidate set. The process of new word
construction is shown in figure 8. See more detail
in (Pengphon, N. et al 2002)
Figure 8 : New Word Construction process
4.3 Noun Phrase Recognition
Entities or concepts are usually described by
noun phrases. This indicates that text chunks like
noun phrases play an important role in human
language processing. In order to analyze NP, both
statistical and linguistic data are used. The model
of NP analysis system is shown in figure 9. More
detail sees (Pengphon, N. et al 2002)

The first step is morphological analysis for
word segmentation and POS tagging. At the
second step, the compound word is grouped into
one word by using word formation module (see
4.2). The third step, statistical-based technique is
used to identify phrase boundary. This step was
provided for identifying the phrase boundary by
using NP rules. Next step is Noun Phrase
Segmentation. The condition of noun phrase
segmentation is shown in figure 10.
After noun phrase is correctly detected, the
relation in noun phrases will be extracted. There
are 2 types of relation: head-head noun phrase and
head-modifier noun phrase. The process is based
on statistical techniques by considering the
frequency (fi) of each word (wi) in the document
(See figure 11).
5. Conclusion
The computational language models for
Thai in word and phrase level, consisting of
Unknown Word Extraction and Name Entities
identification, New word generation and Noun
phrase recognition, are studied on the basis of
their behavior analysis from the varieties of
corpus. We expected that it could create cost-
effective solutions to the practical problems in the
application developments especially in Thai
Information Retrieval and Information extraction
system. We also give the gateway to access Thai
language resources with hoping that it could be
the bridge of the international collaboration for
developing Multi-Language Processing
applications.

Abstract
Instruments are expressed in language by
various means: prepositions, postposi-
tions, affixes including case marks, nonfi-
nite verbs, etc. We consider here 12 lan-
guages from five families in order to be
able to identify the different meaning com-
ponents that structure instrumentality.

2 Introduction
It is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of
what instrumentality is. In WordNet it is defined
as ?an artifact, or a set of artifacts, that are instru-
mental (i.e. behave as instruments) in accomplish-
ing some end?, i.e. reaching a certain goal. In
this definition, the triple relation agent-instrument-
goal (as in: John cuts the bread with a knife, where
John is agent, knife is instrument that does the cut-
ting, and bread cut is the goal), is left vague in
what concerns the exact involvement of the agent
and the instrument in the action, and the control
the agent has on the instrument and on the action
(Mari and St-Dizier 01).
If almost anything can be an instrument, we can
nevertheless formulate a few criteria that we will
try to elaborate in this paper. First, an instrument
is basically non volitional. When humans play the
role of instruments, they are obviously volitional,
but the action is controlled by another agent who
acts as an ?initiator agent?, taking the initiative of
the action. Instruments cannot be easily associated
with traditional thematic roles, in fact this is not
of much interest, because this is too superficial a
notion and also because instruments are generally
modifiers, not arguments.
In this paper, we address instrumentality as con-
veyed by prepositions or equivalent means (e.g.
postpositions, affixes). Our aim in this study
is twofold: (1) to identify the conceptual facets
of instrumentality so that a conceptual seman-
tics can be defined in the spirit of (Talmy, 01,
03), (Wierzbicka 92, 96) and (2) to elaborate an
accurate enough model for answering questions
about instruments within a cooperative question-
answering system. Instead of focusing on a spe-
cific language to elaborate all possible forms of
instrumentality, we found it more adequate to de-
velop a multilingual approach, considering lan-
guages from various families.
We consider for Europe: German, Spanish,
French, Italian; for India: Kashmiri, Urdu, Hindi
and Bengali; for the far-east: Thai and Malay;
for Northern Africa and the Middle East: Ara-
bic, and Berber dialects (in the group of Amazigh
languages). In this paper, we use the first let-
ter of each language to identify it: Thai, Malay,
Hindi, Urdu, Kashmiri, Bengali, German, Span-
ish, French, Italian, Arabic, BeRber). We have
also more or less adequately transcribed characters
into latin characters. The upper case A is equiva-
lent to aa.
3 An overview of preposition structures
3.1 European languages
German, Spanish, Italian and French, like most
European languages have prepositions that in-
troduce instrumental PPs. The most current
prepositions are:
- German: mit, mit Hilfe von,
mittels, durch, anhand, kraft,
51
dank, per.
- French: avec, par, au moyen de,
gra?ce a`, a` l?aide de, a` travers.
- Spanish: con, en, por, a trave?s de,
mediante, por medio de, a base
de, con la ayuda de, gracias a.
- Italian: con, per mezzo di, tramite,
per, grazie a, con l?aiuto di.
3.2 Arabic and Berber
Arabic essentially has the preposition bi, used as
a prefix of the noun it heads:
Aktoub bi al kalami (I write with a pen).
bi can also be associated with a specific noun
or deverbal form (e.g. ?by applying?) to char-
acterize in more depth the instrumental relation.
This entails generic forms such as bi-tarika,
bi-istemali (by means of, the first form rein-
forces the importance of the instrument, while the
latter is more formal) and bi-fadli (thanks to).
For example, we have a kind of nominal form is-
tikhdam (= using or with the use of, constructed
from the root ?use?) in:
Fasser el massala bi istikhdam mithel (explain a
problem ?with the use of? example). Arabic makes
explicit the metonymy we have in European lan-
guages.
There are a few other prepositions such as min
khilal (through) and min a to express the du-
ality source + instrument of the argument (as in
drink with a bottle, litterally). In the spatial con-
text, au can be used (to reach the top by this trail),
and ala is used to express a channel of commu-
nication.
Berber is composed of a large number of di-
alects, some just spoken in small ?tribes?, others
in larger communities. It is basically dialectal, but
a number of common elements can be identified.
We consider here Berber from the Moroccan Rif,
and the Algerian Kabyle. The main instrumental
preposition is e`g, but prefixes are also used s-,
ge-, th-, kh- which affect the morphology
of the noun they are attached to. The prefix s-
is widely used, with some variants (si, sei,
so in Kabyle), e`g (also realized as g? or ge in
some places), is appropriate only when the action
is under full control of the agent. It is not em-
ployed when the instrument is abstract. In the Rif
area, s- focusses on the instrument contributing to
the action, it makes a kind of fusion between the
action verb and the instrumental noun. ge is only
used in spatial contexts involving means of trans-
portation (travelling by plane), kh is used only in
spatial contexts involving paths.
3.3 The Indic language family
The four languages considered, Kashmiri (Raina,
02), Urdu, Hindi and Bengali, share some simil-
itudes due to their common origins but also
contrasts that result from independent evolutions
which are useful to our analysis. They all have suf-
fixes and postpositions. Case suffixes (vibakhti)
are added to nouns or pronouns, but case suf-
fixes do not correspond strictly to thematic roles
(kAraka). Postpositions may also be used instead
of vibhaktis or in conjunction with them, as a kind
or re-inforcement. Basically, but with some nu-
ances, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Kashmiri lan-
guages have the following kernels:
? direct instrument: se (H/U), sity (K), -e/-te,
diye after null, dwArA after -r (B). Example:
H: raam ne chaabi se taala khola (ram - erg.
key with lock open-past= Ram openened the
lock with a key).
? means instrument: me (H/U), ke zariye (U),
manz (K), -e/-te (B). Example: U: raam
gaadi ke zariye daftar gayaa (ram car by
means of office go-past = Ram went to work
by car).
? causal instrument: ke kaaran (H), ki vajah se
(U), kiny (K), kArANe, kripAya (B). Exam-
ple: K: dil chi sayaahat kiny amir (Delhi be-
present tourism with rich = Delhi is rich with
tourism),
B: dillI paryatan-er khAtire samriddha or dillI
paryatan-er kripAya samriddha (Delhi be-
rich-er thanks to tourism)
? agentive instrument: ke dwaraa (H) ke zariye
(U) zariy, desi (K), diye (B) after -ke when
the nominal form is animate and specific,
diye after null when the nominal form is an-
imate and general (B). Example: H: raam ne
shyaam dwara apna kaam karvaaya (ram erg.
shyam by self?s work do-cause-past = Ram
got his work done by Shyam)
? action instrumentalised: kar (H/U), kerith
(K). Example: U: raam kuud kar ghar ke an-
dar daakhil huaa (ram jump participle house
52
into enter-past = Ram entered the house by
jumping in it)
There are less important cases that capture no-
tions like containment, which will be detailed in
section 5. Postpositions may vary also depending
on the semantic type of the NP they head.
In Bengali, case is indicated in several ways.
Vibhaktis are suffixes that are added to the stems
to form surface forms of words. In Bengali the
nominal stems take one of the following suffixes:
null or shunya vibhakti, -e, -te, -r, etc. Case is also
indicated in Bengali by the use of postpositions.
We have, for example: Cut bread with a knife, re-
alized as either:
1. chhuri diye ruti kATa (knife diye bread cut), or:
2. chhuri-te ruti kAta (knife-te bread cut)
Postpositions in Bengali are derived from certain
inflected forms of nouns, and also certain verbs
in participle form. When these words are used
as postpositions they are often not considered in
their original sense but define a specific type of re-
lationship of the noun phrase with the finite verb
phrase in the sentence. These words are appear
in a fixed form (indeclinables) as postpositions.
When a postposition is used to denote the case,
the nominal word preceding the postposition takes
on a vibhakti that is determined by the particu-
lar postposition. ?diye? is used after null vibhakti,
?dwArA? after -r vibhakti, etc.
3.4 Thai and Malay
Thai and Malay, although spoken in neighbour
countries, are substantially different.
Thai, from the Thai-Kadai family, has 6 prepo-
sitions (Silapasarn, 98) to denote instruments, the
most common being doi and duai which are
used for concrete instruments, means of trans-
portation, instruments close to manners, etc. kap
is used when the instrument is a part of the body,
while thang is used for means of transportation
only. tam characterizes control of the agent, and
chak is restricted to the instruments that convey
an idea of source. Examples:
khian - duai - din so (Write - with - pencil)
pai - pa ris - doi - khrueang bin (Go - Paris - by -
plane)
These semantic distinctions are, however, often vi-
olated in colloquial Thai.
Malay, from the Malayo-polynesian family, has
three ways to introduce instruments: preposition +
NP, affixes and compounding. Affixed words are
built from stems which are instrumental nouns,
this allows for the construction of the equivalent
of PPs, based on the prototypical use of the instru-
mental noun. The most common being: prefixes:
beR- (from kuda, horse, berkuda, on horseback),
meN- (from kunci, key, mengunci, lock with key),
prefix + suffix: meN- + -kan (from paku, nail,
memakukan, to fasten with nails), and with suffix
-i (from ubat, medicine, mengubati, by means of
medicine). Prepositions occur as the head of PPs,
and in verb particle constructions. PPs may also
be subject complements, avoiding the use of verbs
(dia di rumah, she at home). Besides affixes,
Malay has 6 prepositions that denote instrumen-
tality: dengan, melalui, mengikut,
menerusi, dengan menggunakan,
secara.
A simple example is:
berhubung - melalui - telefon (communicate - by -
telephone).
4 The meaning components of
instrumentality
Let us now consider the different meaning compo-
nents that emerge from our multilingual analysis.
The results presented below are still exploratory
due to the complexity of the notion. The distinc-
tions made (e.g. between concrete and abstract in-
struments) may seem arbitrary: they are just meant
to structure the presentation.
4.1 Concrete instruments
All languages studied have at least one basic in-
strumental mark operating over concrete objects
(T: duai, M: dengan, H: se, U: se, K: sity, B: diye,
-e, -te, G: mit, S: con, F: avec, A: bi, BR: e`g). Sev-
eral refinements are identified, for specific types of
NPs, or to denote a specific intention:
? the instrument is a recipient (S: en) or, more
generally, conveys an idea of container (e.g.
spoon) (B: -e kare), the idea behing is that
the container is used to carry the object along
a certain trajectory,
? the instrument is a part of the body (e.g.
hand): T: kap. In this case, the instrument
is not strictly artifactual.
? the goal is difficult to reach, it requires some
efforts from the agent (S: a base de),
53
? the focus can be emphasized by using ded-
icated marks (G: mit Hilfe (von), Mittels
(more fomal: Das Gericht hat mittels einst-
weiliger Verfu?gung den Drogenhandel unter-
sagt (the court has with provisional ordinance
the drug traffic prohibited))).
The second major difficulty is prototypicality
(Rosch, 78). When the instrument used is not very
prototypical of the action, several languages re-
inforce the instrumental prepositions to, sort of,
coerce the type of the noun so that it can become
an acceptable instrument. We have examples in S:
por medio de, B: sAhAjye, sahojoge,
I: per mezzo di, F: au moyen de, par
le biais de (biais= bias which directly ex-
presses this idea), as in:
F: Il a ouvert la porte au moyen d?un cric (he
opened the door by means of a jack).
At a conceptual level, it is quite difficult to
characterize what is a prototypical instrument
for a given action (characterized by subject-verb-
object: John opens the door). Each event has its
own prototypical instrument, making corpus stud-
ies extremely large, probably unfeasable. When
searching on the web, we find an incredible variety
of instruments to open a door, almost impossible
to classify. Next, prototypicality is not a boolean
notion: instruments are more or less prototypical.
Since the instrument is very much dependent on
the verb and on the object, we cannot foresee any
form of incorporation in the verb that would give
us indications. A direction could be to assume
Qualia structures (Pustejovsky 91) associated with
each potential instrument that describes the func-
tion of the object in the telic role. For example,
key(X) would have open(X, door), with door be-
ing quite generic. This approach could work via a
large lexical development for concrete nouns, it is
much more risky when terms are abstract.
4.2 Abstract instruments
Abstract instruments (theorems, regulations, ex-
amples, etc.) are realized identically to concrete
instruments, but with some typical marks such
as: T: tam, H: dwAra, K: zariyi, B: dwArA,
M. mengikut. At this stage, it is difficult to ex-
plain why marks are different from concrete in-
struments. An hypothesis could be that abstract in-
struments are closer to causes (see 5.5), or to more
formal situations for which specific terms were de-
veloped (e.g. for G: kraft).
There are additional marks dedicated to partic-
ular fields: B: sahajoge, and A: min khilal
when instruments are of type ?example? (explain
with an example). U: -ke zariye, S: por
medio de and G: Anhand, Kraft are more
formal, stronger for Kraft and apply particularly
to areas like juridical or psychological domains.
People and organizations can be seen as appro-
priate intermediaries for reaching a goal. They
may be conceived as metaphorical instruments.
Investigations show that people can get controlled
much in the same way as concrete objects:
F: Elle a informe? Paul de son de?part par Pauline
(She informed Paul of her leaving ?by? Pauline).
If we now consider: S: Juan env??o este paquete
por correo (John sent this parcel ?by? post)
Since post is the by-default medium to send pack-
ages, por is the only choice. Using more precise
services, like FedEx, is considered to be an alter-
native way, in that case F: par, avec S: por,
con are both acceptable.
4.3 Metaphorical instruments
Both concrete and abstract objects can be used
metaphorically as instruments. Examples abound
in the literature and on the Web. In 5.6 we ex-
amine the path metaphor which is very produc-
tive. Besides this case, we have a number of
metaphors, such as: write with your heart, fight
with your head, etc. These are not essentially dif-
ferent from metaphors observed in other situations
(Lakoff and Johnson 99).
4.4 The overlap instrument-manner
In a number of cases, it is not very easy to make
a distinction between instrument and manner. It
seems there is a continuum between these two no-
tions or even some form of overlap, where the ob-
ject is both an instrument and a manner at various
degrees, which may depend on context. A vari-
ety of marks contribute to characterize this over-
lap, manners at stake being quite diverse, but we
will not go into the study of manners. Specific
marks dealing with the manner/instrument am-
biguity are: T: doi, G: durch (which is also
used for metaphorical spatial uses), M: dengan
menggunakan, S: en, con, a as in S: es-
cribir en/con rojo (write in red),
T: khian - duai - muek - daeng (write - with - red -
ink)
BR: te`te s-e?fe`ssen (She-eats with-hands).
54
4.5 Causality
It is clear that, a priori, instruments can be viewed
at various degrees as causes of an event. There is
a kind of overlap between these two notions. In-
struments are not volitional, so they are under the
partial or full control of an agent (humans playing
the role of instruments are also controlled by an
agent). Typically I: a causa di, F: a cause
de, S: a causa de signal that the instrument
has brought about an event:
I : Il castello e distrutto a causa di un violento in-
cendio. (The castle has been destroyed ?because
of? a violent fire.)
Causality (e.g. Talmy, 01) being a complex no-
tion, it is not surprising that instruments, viewed
as intermediaries at various degrees, share some
features with causes. For example in cut the bread
with a knife, the cause of the bread being cut is
the action of the agent, but also the use of a pro-
totypical property of the knife: the knife does the
cutting. In (Talmy 01), the instrument is embed-
ded into the causing event:
(caused event) RESULTS FROM (causing event)
where the causing event has the structure:
Instrument ACTON object, where object is bound
or related in some way to the object in the caused
event.
As analyzed in (Mari and Saint-Dizier, 01), in-
strumentality is the convergence of several factors:
? the degree of involvement of the instrument
in the action, therefore, the fact that the in-
strument causes the action or is just a means
managed by the agent who is the main cause,
? the type of control the agent has on the instru-
ment for the action at stake, from full control
to lack of control,
? the control the agent has over the action as a
whole.
Indic languages and Thai are particular explicit on
these matters. They have specific marks for two
major cases:
1. agentive instrument, action not controlled by
the agent: H: ke dwAra, U: ke zariye
K: zariy, desi, T: doi,
2. causal instrument that does most of the ac-
tion, under the control of the agent: H ke
kAran, U: ki vajah se, K. kiny, T:
duai,
Berber allows e`g only when the agent controls the
instrument. The other cases are expressed by non
prepositional forms.
4.6 Instruments and paths
Another productive situation is the use of spatial
metaphors to express instrumentality. The use of
F: par and other marks (e.g. in B., U.), show
that there is a close link between instrumentality
and path descriptions (spatial as well as temporal
paths). This is a kind of metaphorical use of paths
viewed as instruments (as can be seen in (Lakoff
et al 99): ?action is motion, goals are paths, actors
are travellers?). Using an instrument parallels the
use of paths in the domain of space.
Marks denoting paths or sources are of much
interest. Some have really restricted uses, whereas
others are more flexible. We observe the following
main components:
? paths: T: tam, A: min khilal, S: por, a trave?s
de(por correo, by post), de, G: durch, F:
a` travers, note the distinctions, e.g. in M:
melalui (metaphorical paths: M : berhubung
melalui telefon (communicate by telephone)),
menerusi (channel of transmission), H, U:
me, se, T: thang. In B, -e and -te denote
paths where the agent that does the action has
no control, whereas diye and dhare involve at
least a partial control from the agent. In M,
metaphorical passages require melalui.
? sources: F: a`, A: min a, T: chak (for con-
crete and abstract sources). Example: A:
Achroubou mina Karoura (I am drinking with
bottle), which is also a kind of manner.
The duality path/instrument is particularly visi-
ble in, e.g.:
K: raam vot tshochi vati kiny gari (ram reach-past
short route via home = Ram reached home by the
short route).
Another interesting phenomenon occurs when
an argument is both an instrument and a path,
as in look at the moon in a telescope. Tele-
scope is indeed the instrument used and also
the path through which one looks, or which the
light traverses. This double facet of the argu-
ment is visible in surface realizations, where the
preposition used is ambiguous between instrument
(first preposition) and path (second one) readings:
G: mit, durch, S: con, por, M: dengan,
melalui, F: avec, dans. When one wants
55
to strongly stress the path interpretation, then a
more path-oriented preposition is used, e.g. S: a
trave`s de.
4.7 Means of transportation as instruments
Means of transportation (trains, spoons, boxes, en-
velopes, etc.), sometimes viewed as containers,
and mediums of transportation (by air) receive a
special treatment in a number of languages: T:
doi, thang, M: menerusi, melalui (for metaphorical
mediums and passages), H: me, U: ke zariye, K:
manz, zariy, B: kare, -e kare, -ya kare, A: ala, BR:
ge-, kh-, G: per, S: por, en, F: par. We have, for ex-
ample: U: raam gaadi ke zariye daftar gayaa (ram
car by means of office go-past = ram went to post
office by car)
T: pai - pa ris - doi - khrueang bin (Go to - Paris -
by - plane)
B: Nouko-ya kare phuketa jAo or Nouko-ya
phuketa jAo (boat-e kare phuket go or boat-e
phuket go = go by boat to Phuket)
A distinction is made between the medium and
the means as for: M: secara, which is used for
means of communication such as email or letters.
If the agent has effective control over the means,
then, for example, S uses con.
4.8 Language levels
Some marks are proper to formal discourse: G:
Mittels, Kraft, Anhand, H: dwAra.
4.9 Positive or negative orientation
The languages we studied also abound in positive-
oriented marks that express in a certain way the
idea of ?thanks to?: T: khop khun (+kah for fem-
inime and krup for masculine), H: ke kAran, U:
ki vajah, K: kiny, B: -er khAtire, (-er) kripAya, G:
dank, S: gracias a, F: gra?ce a`.
There are also several negative-oriented marks
such as the following prepositional compounds:
F: de la faute de, I: per colpa di, S:
por colpa de (by the fault of), where the term
?fault? conveys a negative orientation.
4.10 Metonymies
In most languages, the prototypical action denoted
by the instrument is implicit, it is analyzed as a
metonymy: object for action. Action is inferred
from the instrument and the verb in the given con-
text. In a number of situations, A and M need
to make explicit the action. For particular cases,
gerundive forms may be prefered to PPs (but not
to be confused with manners, e.g. ?by swim-
ming?), so that the verb that lexicalizes the action
is present.
For example, in M, ?by the trail? in to reach the
top of a mountain by the trail requires to make ex-
plicit how the trail is used: dengan mengikuti de-
nai itu (litt.: with follow trail DET (same cases
in Arabic and German)). Another case is: G:
Mit Flugzeugen la?sst sich Geld verdienen, (With

ject replaces the whole procedure.
The metonymy could be reconstructed, for sim-
ple cases, by the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky
86), whose role is precisely to make explicit pro-
totypical functions of objects via their telic role, as
advocated above.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, we propose the development of 
the Question-Answering Services System for 
the Farmer, through SMS, by focusing on 
query analysis and annotation based on a simi-
lar technique previously applied to language 
generation, thematic roles, and primitive sys-
tems of the Lexical Conceptual Structure 
(LCS).  The annotation places emphasis on the 
semantics model of ?What? and ?How? que-
ries, lexical inference identification, and se-
mantic role, for the answer. Finally, we show 
how these annotations and inference rules con-
tribute to the generalization of the matching 
system over semantic categories in order to 
have a large scale question-answering system. 
1    Challenges and Goals 
In the era of Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT), mobile is a fast and conven-
ient way to communicate over a network. 
Knowledge service via a mobile as ?a right in-
formation for a right man? is a challenging task. 
However, this means of interchange between 
persons has the limitation of personal timing. 
Therefore, Short Message Service (SMS) is a 
better way for giving knowledge service, espe-
cially automatic interchange of short text mes-
sages, by providing the information from an 
automatic Question & Answering System.  
From the results of the statistical ICT data 
survey concerning the number and percent of the 
population 6 years of age and over who use in-
formation and communication technology: 2003 
- 2007 by the National Statistical Office1, Thai-
land, it was found that  47.2% of people in the 
entire kingdom have owned their mobile(s). 
Consequently, communicating via SMS facili-
tates an effective knowledge service for support-
ing the farmers in problem-solving, decision 
making, and early warning, and also supports the 
government, or a related organization, in order to 
e-communicate to the farmer by changing the 
model of ?Training and Visit? to e-service and 
changing the collective to support cooperative 
problem solving. This kind of communication 
will provide the necessary long-term cost reduc-
tions to the agricultural economy in the areas of 
travel, visiting, productivity, etc.  
Nowadays, providing a knowledge service 
through SMS is not limited to only a Question-
Answering Services System, but also for such 
one-way services as early warning systems, for 
example, a Tsunami Alert System2, a FloodSMS 
? Early Detection and Warning of Catastrophic 
Flooding via SMS3, etc. 
The development of a Question-Answering 
Services System through SMS is not the design 
of a new technology. There have been several 
theories developed earlier, in the context of NLP 
or cognitive sciences, such as Natural Language 
Information Retrieval (NLIR), rule based Q&A, 
etc.  Nevertheless, some former theories of Q&A 
relied on complex semantic information. For in-
stance, a Wireless Natural Language Search En-
gine [6] was implemented using a system resid-

ing on a server, which can translate questions or 
phrases into search engine queries or queries to 
SOAP Web services, where a gateway mediates 
between the mobile network and the Internet. 
Also, [15] developed the SMS for Question-
Answering in the m-Learning Scenario System 
by using the Simple Matching Algorithm to 
match the learners? answer messages with the 
original answer string, thus facilitating the learn-
ers to get the necessary feedback and assessment.  
In this paper, we propose the development of 
the Question-Answering Services System for the 
Farmer through SMS by focusing on query 
analysis and annotation, as well as on selected 
text matching utilizing lexical inference and se-
mantic roles. The annotation emphasizes the se-
mantics model of ?What? and ?How? queries. 
Finally, we show how these annotations and in-
ference rules contribute to the generalization of 
the matching system over semantic categories in 
order to have a large scale question-answering 
system.  
In the current stage, we have designed Q&A 
schema with thematic roles and have borrowed 
some primitive systems of the Lexical Concep-
tual Structure (LCS). Also, we are annotating 
1000 questions and text related to the query (but 
we randomly choose 100 pairs of Q&A for the 
experiment). In the same time, we are generaliz-
ing inference rules in order to match a question 
to its answer. This is particularly crucial when 
there is no straightforward response, e.g. when 
they require some form of lexical inference, 
elaboration, and reasoning or when the response 
is not a simple item, but a well-formed fragment 
of text, e.g. a chain of events leading to a conse-
quence, a procedure, etc.  
The project we present here emerged from a 
need of the real end-users, the Agricultural Land 
Reform Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Co-
operative, Thailand, in the project of ALRO Cy-
berBrain [3], which is a social network frame-
work that combines approaches based on knowl-
edge science and engineering with language en-
gineering, consisting of an ontology-based search 
engine, information extraction for Q&A system, 
knowledge aggregation through a knowledge 
portal and visualized in a browser with semantic 
links between problems, methods of problems 
solving and man who is the problem solver 
(PMM map Model) [1]. The main goal is to de-
velop tools for e-Farming, in particular rice farm-
ing, so that farmers can easily get information on 
farming rice and rice diseases. Now, it has been 
extended to provide question-answering services 
for the farmers through SMS [2].  
2    Problem Statements 
There are two main problems in Q&A analy-
sis: semantic interpretation for a question word 
and answer identification. 
2.1    Question?s Semantic Roles 
2.1.1    Question Word Interpretation.  
In general, when we query for the answer by a 
traditional search engine system, we might get 
many answers at different levels, depending on 
the role of the question: Definition vs Fact or set 
of Facts.  For example, with the question  
Q1: ????|????|???|????? 
     Rice| Blast| is| what 
    ?What is a Rice Blast??  
The answer can be returned as the definitions, 
fact or a set of facts, which are: 
A1.1: Blast, also called rotten neck, is one of the 
most destructive diseases of Missouri rice. 
Blast does not develop every year but is 
very destructive when it occurs.4   
A1.2:   Disease of Leave Burnt caused by Pyricu-
laria Oryzae can destroy all rice growing 
period  from start until harvest period.5 
The answer can be returned as the characteris-
tics detail or set of facts, such as the following: 
A1.3 : Blast symptoms can occur on leaves, 
leaf collars, nodes and panicles. Leaf spots are 
typically diamond shaped, with gray- white cen-
ters and brown to red-brown margins. Fully de-
veloped leaf lesions are approximately 0.4 to 0.7 
inch long and 0.1 to 0.2 inch wide. Both the 
shape and color vary depending on the environ-
ment, age of the lesion and rice variety.6  
2.1.2    Variety of Question Forms.  
In natural language, the question can be asked 
with different words and styles, for example:  
Q2.1:??????|????????|???|???|????|????|??????? 
situation| outbreak| of| disease| Rice Blast| 
is| how  
?What is the situation of Rice Blast?? 
Q2.2:????????|???|???|????|??|??????|??????? 
outbreak| of| disease| Rice Blast| is| characteristic| how 
     ?How does the rice blast outbreak look like??

5  http://www.sotus.co.th/article_4.html 
6  http://aes.missouri.edu/delta/muguide/mp645.stm 
 
4
Q2.3:???|????|?????|???|??????? 
Rice Blast| disperse| able| how 
?How can the rice blast disperse?? 
The reply can be returned the same answers 
with a descriptive set of events, as the following: 
A2.1: To prevent the Rice Blast: for the places 
that we often found the disease, use the dis-
ease-resistant rice variety. Don't sow the 
rice seed too densely. Don't use to much Ni-
trogen. If it is severe outbreak and it is the 
state of young plant, plow and sow again. If 
it was the epidemic state, use Fungus-
Removal chemical as Carbendasim. 
A2.2: Brown spot may be reduced by balanced 
fertilization, crop rotation, and the use of 
high quality planting seed. Seed treatment 
fungicides reduce the incidence and severity 
of seedling blight caused by this fungus. 
The examples above show that using different 
verbs or noun phrases can be represent the same 
meaning. Moreover, there is non-correspondent 
focus word between Q and A. 
2.2    Answer Type Identification 
2.2.1    Ambiguity between subtopic and an-
swer form 
To identify the answer, sometimes there is an 
ambiguity that verb phrases occurring after the 
focus word of the question can be both subtopics 
and the answer, like a procedural answer, for 
example,: 
Q3: ???????|???????|???|????|???|???|??????? 
 method| control| Rice Blast| to do| how 
 ?What method can be used to control Rice 
Blast??  
A3:  ???????|???????|???|????|??|?????? 
 method| control| Rice Blast| have| such as 
?Methods for preventing the Rice Blast are:? 
? ???|???????|???|??????? 
 use| Chemical Substance | that| appropriate 
?Use appropriate Chemical Substance.? 
? ???|??????|???|??????? 
 use| type of rice | that| appropriate 
?Use appropriate type of rice.? 
? ???|????|??|???|??????? 
 use| mechanism| in| prevent 
?Use mechanism to prevent.? 
? ???|???????|??????? 
 use| methods| hybrid 
?Use hybrid  methods.? 
The examples above convey the 4 types of 
method for Rice Blast control or names of meth-
ods, but it is not the process or the answers that 
represent how to control the disease. 
2.2.2    Non-correspondence between Q & A: 
Sometimes, the question and answer were not 
matched because the clue words or focus words 
in the question have never appeared in the an-
swers. This makes the question not correspond to 
the answer and also causes difficulty in finding 
the expected answer. For example, 
Q4: ??????|??????|????|?????|????|????????|???|??????? 
can| control| pests | rice | these | How  
?How can these rice pests be controlled??  
A4: ????|?????|????????|??????|??????|???|???|???|???????|????|
??????|???|???| |???| |????|????|??????|???????|???|,| |????|
????|???|??????|, |??????|?????|????|??|?? |???|???|???|???|
???|???|????|???|???|???|????|???|?????|?????||???|???| 
?These pests can be managed through inte-
grated approach including sowing insect re-
sistant rice varieties, sowing rice crop at rec-
ommended time, proper water management 
conservation and augmentation of bio-control 
predators.? 
From the example, the focus word of the 
question is ?control,? but there is no word ?con-
trol? in the answer. For this kind of Q&A match-
ing solution, WordNet and ontology are neces-
sary. 
3    Outline of the Project and Methodol-
ogy  
The needs of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture 
have been specified in a simple way via a corpus 
composed of (1) questions raised in real life by 
farmers (about 1000 questions), (2) the responses 
which have been provided by experts, based on 
existing documents (possibly several responses 
per question) and, quite often, (3) the texts they 
originate from. In general, the response is found 
in a unique text: there are no multiple answers, 
since most texts are not redundant, although 
some responses, in particular complex (e.g. 
evaluative questions) or indirect ones, may in-
volve the taking into account of several inde-
pendent texts. We will not address here the prob-
lem of message length reduction so that it fits 
into an SMS format (although this is also an im-
portant semantic problem). 
The system overview is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. System Architecture 
To develop a Thai QA system, the preprocess-
ing of Thai morphology and syntax is necessary. 
The NAIST lab at the University of Kasetsart has 
basic tools to manage morphological analysis, 
parts-of-speech recognition, simple syntactic 
analysis, as well as Thai parsing, and an Element 
Discourse Unit System (EDU). These tools were 
designed as basic tools in natural language proc-
essing applications. (accessible on 
http://vivaldi.cpe.ku.ac.th:9292/ with a recom-
mendation to use the Mozilla Firefox browser) 
A few examples of question-answer pairs are: 
Q5:  ???????|???????|??????|????|??????|???|???|??????? 
?How to prevent the Weedy rice? 
A5.1: ???|????|????|????|???|??? 
?Skip some seasons when growing rice,? 
A5.2: ????|???|???|?????|???? 
?Grow hydrotonics plants.? 
Q6:  ???|??|???|?????|???|??|???????|??????|??????? 
?How to control the Bacterial Leaf 
Streak  Disease? 
A6: ???|???|???|????|????????|???|??????| 
  ?Do not put too much Nitrogen.? 
Q7:  ???|??|??????|??|?????| |??????|??????|????|???|
???|????|????|?? 
?How to eradicate the rice thrips? 
A7:  ???|???|????|?????????|????|?????????|???|???????|  |
???|????|???|???|????|???| |?| |???|??? 
?Spray with Malathion or Carbaryl 
every week, add fertilizer and water 
every two days.? 
Questions are essentially factoid questions 
(e.g. best periods for rice planting, rice varieties 
suggestion, symptoms of a disease), why ques-
tions, where responses are chains of events (rea-
sons for something to happen) and a large num-
ber of procedural questions [4], in particular for 
treating diseases. There are relatively few com-
parative or evaluative questions besides general 
questions, such as: What are the major rice 
pests? 
In most cases, questions do not have responses 
which can be immediately found in the texts by 
standard term matching techniques. For example: 
?How does the Sheath Blight affect the rice 
growth?? has the following response in a text: 
Plants heavily infected at these stages produce 
poorly filled grain, particularly in the lower por-
tion of the panicle. Additional losses result from 
... Therefore, some lexical semantics devices 
(e.g. a semantic link between affect and infect) or 
more elaborated reasoning schemas, based on 
domain knowledge, are needed to allow appro-
priate question-text matching [11, 7]. The kind of 
domain knowledge at stake may be quite unex-
pected (i.e., not the main topics that everyone 
knows, but more subtle pieces of information, as 
will be seen in 4.3). This is the major challenge 
of this work, which we try to resolve via a full 
annotation of the matching process, from ques-
tion parsing to response production, identifying 
matching and reasoning aspects. 
Complex questions may, e.g., require the 
elaboration of a diagnosis from premises given in 
the question before finding the response, either 
factoid or procedural (My rice has weedy leaves 
and some yellow spots, what should I do?). This 
question requires one to select all texts where 
such a symptom is identified, and then, e.g., to 
enter into a dialogue with the user if there are 
several possible diagnoses, leading to different 
treatments. 
The second aspect of this problem is to be able 
to extract the complete text portion that responds 
to the question. For that purpose we are develop-
ing an annotation methodology whose goal is to 
identify the different processes at stake and the 
needed resources. This method allows us to iden-
tify relevant text portions and then to delimit 
them appropriately. 
4    The Question-Answering Process An-
notation 
Since the task is quite large (a large group of stu-
dents are annotating a set of 600 questions and 
related texts), we need to establish norms and 
annotation guidelines. Using the research con-
ducted at IRIT on annotating procedural ques-
tions and instructions based on semantic roles

(TextCoop project) and a few rhetorical relations 
(e.g. elaboration, example, explanation), we first 
annotated the questions and their corresponding 
responses in texts provided by the Thai Ministry 
of Agriculture. One of the challenges was to 
identify relevant linguistic marks or patterns [9, 
10, 14]. 
There are many attempts to annotate argu-
ments by means of primitives; our approach, 
here, is oriented towards the precise task at stake 
and the specific actions. Therefore roles are not 
as standard as they are in general. An earlier at-
tempt with a similar technique applied to lan-
guage generation was carried out in, e.g., [10, 7]. 
Semantic tags are either close to thematic roles 
(instrument, location, etc.) [8], or borrowed from 
the primitive systems of the Lexical Conceptual 
Structure (LCS) [13], in particular, to establish 
useful links between arguments or between a 
large variety of constituents, which thematic 
roles cannot do. For example, in the first Thai 
university we have a link between 'first' and 'Thai 
university' which is either loctemp or loc+char+ident, 
depending on the interpretation of first (oldest or 
the best). However, in a majority of cases, se-
mantic roles based on thematic roles have a suf-
ficient granularity, and these are the ones which 
are used in the examples in 4.1. 
The main roles we consider are: agents (for 
humans and animals like insects, and metaphori-
cally for diseases and natural forces), themes 
(undergoing actions, basically plants and soils, 
and artificial products), location (spatial), time 
(covering dates and also periods), instruments 
(from tools to chemical products), manners, 
means, conditions (under which to realize an ac-
tion, or related to observation e.g. of a disease), 
cause, goals, and results. 
Besides, the tags <action>?</action> or 
<fact>?</fact> were considered to tag the verb 
with it?s arguments or adjuncts. 
In the remainder of this section we briefly re-
port the different steps of the process as they 
stand at the moment, i.e. almost at the end of the 
experimental stage, before automating knowl-
edge acquisition, and implementing the applica-
tion. 
4.1    Dealing with Questions 
As in most systems dealing with complex types 
of questions, questions are represented by a tri-
ple: the question type (which can be in our case 
polymorphic), the question focus (usually an NP 
or a VP in case events or procedures are induced) 
and the question body, annotated by means of 
semantic roles, as indicated above. 
The main types of questions we have identi-
fied from our corpus are the following; they are 
quite different from standard classifications, but 
they correspond to more operational views: 
F: fact, with subtypes: temp (temporal, time, 
date), loc (location) or product, 
E: an event (with a subtype event: cause)  
SF: set of facts  
SE: set of events (not related, and without any 
form of sequence: different from SqE be-
low)  
PROC: procedure, more or less complex, it 
may be just a single instruction; it can also 
describe the use of an instrument.  
SqE: sequence of events, which follow each 
other.  
EVAL: evaluation, making value decisions 
about issues or resolving controversies or 
differences of opinion.  
DEF: definition, the description of object.  
Some questions may bear several non-
conflicting types, in particular when the nature of 
the response is not straightforward to determine 
from the question. For example, ?What is the 
symptom of Bakanae?? would get the types SF 
and SE. 
An annotated question is, for example: 
 
As can be noted, the response is the set of 
those facts that contribute, together or independ-
ently, to the spreading of the disease. 
By the observation from 100 random inter-
rogative sentences corpus analysis, we found that 
the semantic types of questions correspondent to 
the question words are the following 
Q-Types What When Where Why Who Which How 
F 11 6 1   1 9 2 
E       1     6 
SF 3         15 3 
SE 7         2 5 
PROC             15 
SqE             7 
EVAL 2       1     
DEF 3             
Table 1 the correspondence between questions 
and semantic types of questions 
From Table 1, it is clear that ?what? and 
?how? questions vary in types of question, be-
cause they have many forms to use, for example, 
?how + verb to be + noun?, ?how + do(es) + 
noun + verb?, ?how to?, ?how can?, etc. or  
?what + verb to be + noun?, ?what + noun + 
auxiliary verb?, etc. This is why we point out the 
?What? and ?How? questions. 
<question type=? SF or SE? focus=? symptom of 
Bakanae?> What <fact> is <theme> the symp-
tom of Bakanae </theme> </fact> ? </question>
7
4.2    Dealing with texts: document indexing 
and associated annotations 
Texts are initially indexed based on the main 
terms they contain which are relevant w.r.t. the 
questions given in the corpus. Our representation 
resembles a frame approach, but it is more 
flexible since there is no predefined structure to 
represent indexes. This is more in accordance 
with the variety of texts in terms of contents. In-
dexes basically are formed from: 
? Top-level terms that structure the domain: 
for example, concepts like symptom, 
spreading, treatment, time, place, effect, 
etc. where predicative (action terms) terms 
as well as entities are found, 
? relatively generic terms, found in the 
questions and structured in the domain on-
tology: water, clean, control, eradicate, 
etc., which are organized w.r.t. the top 
concepts above, 
? named entities, typed as: disease names, 
location names, chemical product names, 
bacteria names, etc. 
In our representation, those generic terms (and 
near synonyms) are represented as predicates, 
while arguments are represented as attribute-
value pairs (or attributes alone), include typed 
name entities and any kind of terms besides the 
generic terms.  
Indexes are associated with texts in the text 
database. Indexes must remain general so that 
indexing is fast and as reliable as possible. The 
idea is that when a question is uttered, a small 
number of texts are first selected on the basis of 
the indexes for further analysis. An example  
below can be indexed and annotated [2] as the 
following: 
 
Index: disease-name (Bakanae), symptoms (disease: Bakanae), 
origin (disease: Bakanae, place: California, date: 1999), spread-
ing(disease: Bakanae, period: winter, medium: [soil, water]), treat-
ment(disease: Bakanae, product). 
 
<title type=?goal? level=?1? > Rice Bakanae </title> 
<title type=?goal? level=?2?>SYMPTOMS </title> 
  <task type = ?SF?>  
<theme>Symptoms of Bakanae</theme> first appear about a 
month after planting. Infected seedlings appear to be taller, more 
slender, and slightly chlorotic ... The rapid elongation of infected 
plants is caused by the pathogen?s production of the plant hormone, 
gibberellin.....</task> 
 
<title type=?goal? level=?2?>COMMENTS ON THE DISEASE 
</title> 
Bakanae is one of the oldest known diseases of rice in Asia but has 
only been observed in California rice since 1999 and now occurs in 
all California rice-growing regions. While very damaging in Asia, 
the extent to which Bakanae may effect California rice production 
is unknown. As diseased plants ..... 
 
4.3   Matching selected texts with questions: 
the deep indexing level 
The main words of the question focus and body 
are used to select a subset of indexed texts as 
potential candidates containing the response. 
Then, in each of these texts, the few sentences 
where the terms of the question or derived terms 
(closely related terms) are effectively found are 
annotated by means of semantic roles as for the 
question, for further analysis and investigations.  
For that purpose, we have developed guide-
lines for annotating those text fragments where 
the response is and the associated knowledge, 
based on the same semantic roles as those used 
in the questions. These annotations remain so far 
exploratory, in terms of feasibility and automa-
tion. Our major concern is to develop a method 
for annotators so that a large number of texts can 
be tagged homogeneously and also so that the 
technique can be reproduced for other technical 
areas. Finally, in terms of response identification, 
the goal is to define a metric that defines the best 
match and selects the text fragment(s) that best 
respond(s) to the question among several poten-
tial candidates. 
Let us first consider a simple example. Given 
the question: 
Q8: ?How to eradicate Bakanae ??  
with the following representation: 
 
The main terms of the question are ?eradicate? 
and ?Bakanae?. The text above is therefore se-
lected on the basis of its indexes, because ?treat-
ment? is a closely related term (in terms of se-
mantic relation: ?way to realize an event?) of 
?eradicate? in the domain ontology. 
Then, the question terms are searched in the 
selected text and the sentences that contain them 
are annotated using semantic roles. For example, 
the following sentence is a candidate: 
The most effective means to treat this disease 
is the use of noninfested seeds.  
It is tagged as: 
<title type=?goal? level=?2?>MANAGEMENT</title> 
<task type = ?PROC?>  
The most effective means to<action> treat <theme> this disease 
</theme> </action> is the <instruction compound><instruction 
type="imperative">use of noninfested seed</instruction>. 
Also,<connector type="advice"> when possible</connector>, <ad-
vice>burning plant residues</advice> with known infection in fall 
may help limit the disease. ..... Field trials indicate that a seed treat-
ment with sodium hypochlorite (Ultra Clorox Germicidal Bleach) is 
effective at reducing the incidence of this disease.... </instruction 
compound></task> 
<question type=?PROC or SqE? focus ?eradi-
cate Bakanae? > How to <action> eradicate 
<theme> Bakanae </theme>  </action> ? 
</question> 
8
 
The answer is the above sentence and the text 
fragment that follows (introduced by the connec-
tor also) since the response is of type procedure: 
The most effective means to treat this disease 
is the use of noninfested seed. Also, when possi-
ble, burning plant residues with known infection 
in fall may help limit the disease. 
Following [5], this structure is annotated as a 
single instructional compound, which is the fun-
damental unit in a procedural text. This is the 
structure which is typically returned to users. 
Let us present here another illustrative exam-
ple of a text fragment where the response is an-
notated together with the required related reason-
ing elements: 
Q9: ?How can thrips destroy the rice ?? 
annotation: 
 
The text fragment that corresponds to the an-
swer is annotated as follows: 
 
To match the action ?destroy? in the question 
with the text portion from which the response is 
extracted, it is then necessary to identify the in-
ference: 
 
 This example shows that (1) in the question 
and in the answer, annotations are used to iden-
tify the different components, arguments, ad-
juncts, but also some other components (e.g. 
temporal adverbs), and (2) the annotation is de-
veloped to characterize the matching steps and 
inferential components (either lexical or domain 
knowledge) between the question and the an-
swer. This latter form of annotation, which is 
quite time-consuming to develop, is the means 
we use to induce and develop domain dependent 
forms of lexical inference (or other phenomena 
like synonymy, lexical equivalence, etc.) and 
relevant domain knowledge. The types and lexi-
cal functions which are introduced are then used 
in the process of induction of generalizations 
over some semantic categories (plants, products, 
etc.), and verb classes. This way of annotating 
knowledge and inferences is obviously a simple 
bottom-up process, with well known limitations, 
but we feel it may have some advantages for in-
ducing an upper organization of knowledge, in 
conjunction, and as a complement to, the domain 
ontology. It is also simple and accessible to an-
notators. Obviously this remains to be evaluated.  
4.4  Generalizing inferences for question-
answer matching 
At this level, the inferences which may be drawn 
are directly attached to the terms which are 
tagged. This is obviously too limited. We are 
now experimenting with different generalization 
strategies in order to tune the lexical inference 
rules. This process involves: 
(1) developing various generic principles over 
different types and categories (via the domain 
ontology), We will annotation the title for match-
ing the ?theme? of the answer to the ?theme? and 
?Focus? of the question by using word net and 
ontology as shown below.  
Surface Form Concept 
destroy, destruct, eliminate, kill,? destroy 
treat, prevent, eradicate, protect,? manage 
suck, eat, bite, drink,? consume 
spread out, diffuse, disperse,? spread 
(2) a set of principles that limit these generali-
zations via, for example, the taking into account 
of the semantics restrictions imposed by lexical 
items, in particular verbs. The main words of the 
question focus and text body that already anno-
tated will be considered for extracting the poten-
tial candidates containing the response. The sen-
tences, where the terms of the question or de-
rived terms (closely related terms) are effectively 
found, will be the corresponding answer by using 
matching function as shown below. 
 
Function Matching (Question Q, Answer A){ 
      Match = false; 
     // Relevant document 
     If  (Q.focus  =  A.index)  then 
             // Relevant answer 
             If  (Q.type =  A.task type) then      
                    //Detect Answer for the Question 
                    If (Q.focus = A.title) then 
                         Match = true; 
                    Else if (Q.action = A.action and 
                               Q.theme = A.theme or 
                               Q.agent = A.agent) then 
                         Match = true; 
                    End If 
             End If 
       End If 
Return Match;} 
The tuning of the level of these generalizations 
is obviously one main parameter of our project. 
It has several conceptual dimensions that we ex-
plore and may also be domain dependent. 
<lex_inference>  <action> Suck sap of X 
</action>  <entail>  <modality> probably  
</modality>  <action> destroy X </action>  
</entail> ,  <type> X : plant </type>   
<part-of> sap : X </part-of >  </lex inference>  
<response>  <agent> The rice thrips</agent> 
<action>  sucks the sap <source>  from the young
plant. </source> </action> </response> 
<question type=?SqE? focus = ?destroy?>How 
can <agent> thrips </agent> <action>destroy 
<theme>the rice</theme> </action>?</question>
?<action> treat <theme> this disease </theme>   
is the use of <instrument> noninfested seeds 
</instrument> </action> .

Perspectives 
The matching problem between questions and 
documents to retrieve answers in question-
answering systems in concrete applicative con-
texts is often a difficult problem. This matching 
procedure often requires very accurate domain 
knowledge, besides ontological descriptions. It is 
not always easy to access this knowledge in a 
structured way or to extract it from texts. The 
present contribution, still experimental and in an 
early stage of development, is an attempt, via 
annotations, at resolving this problem, following 
a simple and clear methodology. 
This task needs to be developed and evaluated 
gradually. So far, it is too early to evaluate the 
quality of the generalizations and the inferential 
patterns we get.  
This approach, and the principles we have 
briefly outlined, allow us to introduce a working 
method for the development of question-
answering systems for concrete applications, es-
pecially for non-factoid questions, an area which 
is still not very much developed in spite of its 
obvious usefulness. One of the reasons is that 
non-factoid questions require a language proc-
essing technology, analysis methods, reasoning 
aspects, and a conceptual approach, which are 
substantially different from what is used for fac-
toid questions.

Abstract
In this poster we present an approach to responding to complex
questions in the agriculture domain, from specifications given by ex-
perts. We present in particular a semantic annotation procedure that
would allow us to define accurate and domain dedicated forms of lexical
semantics inference, in order to be able to match non factoid questions
(i.e. questions whose response is a significant text portion) with doc-
uments on a large scale. This project is designed to help farmers to
get advices via question answering on SMS in order to improve rice
farming.
1 Challenges and Goals
Question answering (Moldovan 2000, Maybury 2004) operates on top of
search engines of classical textual database querying tools, by providing a
layer that has natural language understanding and generation as well some
reasoning capabilities in order to provide users with responses which are
much more accurate and cooperative than what search engines provide in
general. This is particularly crucial when responses are not straightforward,
e.g. when they require some form of elaboration (synthesis of data, consis-
tency checking, etc.), reasoning or when the response is not a simple item,
but a well-formed fragment of text, e.g. a chain of events leading to a con-
sequence, a procedure, etc.
The project we present here emerged from a need from the Thai Ministry
of Agriculture. The main goal is to develop tools for e-Farming, in particular
rice farming, so that farmers can easily get information on farming rice and
rice diseases, for example via SMS. The Thai Ministry of Agriculture has
338
large text databases on the way rice can be planted, on how to prepare and
fertilize soils and on the numerous diseases rice may be subject to, the ef-
fects, the treatments, etc. Question answering is a particularly well-adapted
approach to allow farmers to query in Thai (via SMS short messages) such
databases.
The NAIST lab at the university of Kasetsart has basic tools to parse
Thai (stemmer, morphological analysis, part of speech recognition, and sim-
ple syntactic analysis). These tools were designed for machine translation
purposes, but they turn out to be appropriate to parse queries and to retreive
information in technical texts.
2 Outline of the Project and Methodology
The needs of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture have been specified in a sim-
ple way via a corpus composed of (1) questions raised in real life by farmers
(about 1000 questions), (2) the responses which have been provided by ex-
perts based on existing documents (possibly several responses per question)
and (3) the texts they originate from. In general the response is found in
a unique text: there are no multiple answers since most texts are not re-
dundant, although some responses, in particular complex or indirect ones,
may involve the taking into account of several independent texts. We will
not address here the problem of message length reduction so that it fits into
SMS format (althought this is also an important semantic problem).
A few examples of question-answer pairs are (glosses from Thai, but
structures are in fact quite similar to English):
Q: How to prevent the Weedy rice?
R1: Skip some seasons when growing rice,
R2: Grow hydrotonics plants.
Q: How to control the Bacterial Leaf Streak Disease?
R: Do not put too much Nitrogen.
Q: How to eradicate the rice thrips?
R: Spray with Malathion or Carbaryl every week, add fertilizer and water
every two days.
Questions are essentially factoid questions (e.g. products to use, best pe-
riods for plantations, varieties to use, symptoms of a desease), why questions
where responses are chains of events (reasons for something to happen) and
a large number of procedural questions (Delpech et al 2008) in particular
for treating deseases. There are no comparative or evaluative questions as
in other domains.
339
In most cases, questions do not have responses which can be immediately
found in the texts. For example: How does the Sheath Blight affects the rice
growth? has the following response: Plants heavily infected at these stages
produce poorly filled grain, particularly in the lower portion of the panicle.
Additional losses result from .... Therefore some lexical semantics devices
are needed to allow appropriate question-text matching. The second aspect
of this problem is to be able to extract the complete text portion that
responds to the question. For that purpose we are developing an annotation
methodology whose goal is to identify the different processes at stake and
the needed resources.
3 The Question-Answering Process Annotation
Since the task is quite large (a large group of students are annotating the set
of 1000 questions and related texts), we need to establish norms and anno-
tation guidelines. Based on the research conducted at IRIT on annotating
procedural questions and instructions based on semantic roles (TextCoop
project), we first annotate the questions and their corresponding responses
as provided by the ministry of agriculture. There are many attempts to
annotate arguments by means of primitives, our approach is here oriented
towards the task and the specific actions. Therefore roles are not as stan-
dard as they are in general (see IWCS 2009 Dautriche et al this volume).
An earlier attempt for language generation is e.g. (Delin 1994). Seman-
tic tags are either close to thematic roles (instrument, location, etc.) or
borrowed from the primitive systems of the Lexical Conceptual Structure
(LCS), in particular to establish links between arguments, which thematic
roles cannot do. For example, in the first Thai university we have a link
between ?first? and ?Thai university? which is either loc
temp
or loc
+char+ident
depending on the interpretation of first (oldest or the best). Then, the text
in which the response occurs is annotated (so that the boundaries and sur-
rounding elements of the response can be characterized) and the underlying
lexical semantics mechanisms at stake are given.
Let us present here an illustrative example:
Q: How can thrips destroy the rice ?
annotation:
<question type=?manner? > How can <agent> thrips </agent> <action>
destroy <theme> the rice </theme> </action> ? </question>
The response is annotated as follows:
<response> <agent> The rice thrips <action> sucks the sap <source>
340
from the young plant. </source> </action> </response>
To match the action ?destroy? in the question with the text portion from
which the response is extracted, it is then necessary to identify the inference:
<lex inference> <action> Suck sap of X </action> <entail> <modality>
probably </modality> <action> destroy X </action> </entail>,
<type> X : plant </type>
<part-of> sap : X </part-of > </lex inference>
This example shows that (1) in the question and in the answer, anno-
tations are used to identify the different components, arguments, adjuncts,
but also some other components (e.g. temporal adverbs), and (2) the an-
notation developed to characterize the matching between the question and
the answer is used to induce and develop forms of lexical inference (or other
phenomena like synonymy, lexical equivalence, etc.). The types and lexi-
cal functions which are introduced contribute to the process of induction of
generalizations over some semantic categories (plants, products, etc.), and
verb classes.
At this level, the inferences which may be drawn are directly attached
to the terms which are tagged. This is obviously too limited. We are now
exprimenting different generalization levels in order to tune lexical inference
rules. This process involves (1) generalization principles over different types
and categories (via a domain ontology), and (2) a set of principles that
limit these generalizations via, for example, the taking into account of the
semantics restrictions imposed by lexical items, in particular verbs. This
task needs to be developed and evaluated gradually,; so far it is too early to
evaluate the quality of the rules we get, but we believe this is a simple and
close to the data approach and it should be reproducible to other areas.
This approach, and the principles we have briefly outlined, allow us
to introduce a working method for the development of question-answering
systems for concrete applications, for non-factoid questions.
