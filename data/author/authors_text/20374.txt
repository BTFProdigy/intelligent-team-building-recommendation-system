Abstract 
In this paper, we present our contribution in 
SemEval2014 ABSA task, some supervised 
methods for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of 
restaurant and laptop reviews are proposed, im-
plemented and evaluated. We focus on determin-
ing the aspect terms existing in each sentence, 
finding out their polarities, detecting the catego-
ries of the sentence and the polarity of each cate-
gory. The evaluation results of our proposed 
methods exhibit a significant improvement in 
terms of accuracy and f-measure over all four 
subtasks regarding to the baseline proposed by 
SemEval organisers. 
1 Introduction 
The increasing amount of user-generated textual 
data has increased the need of efficient tech-
niques for analysing it. Sentiment Analysis (SA) 
has become more and more interesting since the 
year 2000 (Liu 2012), many techniques in Natu-
ral Language Processing have been used to un-
derstand the expressed sentiment on an entity. 
Many levels of granularity have been also distin-
guished: Document Level SA considers the 
whole document is about an entity and classifies 
whether the expressed sentiment is positive, neg-
ative or neutral; Sentence Level SA determines 
the sentiment of each sentence, some works have 
been done on Clause Level SA but they are still 
not enough; Entity or Aspect-Based SA performs 
finer-grained analysis in which all entities and

their aspects should be extracted and the senti-
ment on them should also be determined. 
Aspect-Based SA task consists of several sub-
problems, the document is about many entities 
which could be for example a restaurant, a lap-
top, a printer. Users may refer to an entity by 
different writings but normally there are not a lot 
of variations to indicate the same entity, each 
entity has many aspects which could be its parts 
or attributes, some aspects could be another enti-
ty such as screen of laptop, but most works did 
not take this case into account. Therefore, we 
could define the opinion by the quintuple (Liu 
2012) (ei, aij, sijkl, hk, tl) where ei is the entity i, aij 
are the aspects of the entity i,  sijkl  is the ex-
pressed sentiment on the aspect at the time tl, hk 
the holder which created the document or the 
text. 
This definition does not take into account that the 
entity has aspects that could have also other as-
pects which leads to an aspect hierarchy, in order 
to avoid this information loss, few works have 
handled this issue, they proposed to represent the 
aspect as a tree of aspect terms (Wei and Gulla 
2010; Kim, Zhang et al. 2013).  
Supervised and unsupervised methods have been 
used for handling this task, in this paper, we pro-
pose supervised methods and test them over two 
datasets related to laptop reviews and restaurant 
reviews provided by the ABSA task of 
SemEval2014 (Pontiki, Galanis et al. 2014). We 
tackle four subtasks: 
1. Aspect term extraction: CRF model is 
proposed. 
2. Aspect Term Polarity Detection:  
Multinomial Naive-Bayes classifier with 
some features such as Z-score, POS and 
prior polarity extracted from Subjectivity 
596
Lexicon (Wilson, Wiebe et al. 2005) and 
Bing Liu's Opinion Lexicon1. 
3. Category Detection: 
Z-score model for category detection has 
been used. 
4. Category Polarity Detection: 
The same model proposed for aspect 
term polarity detection has been adopted. 
2 Related works 
Several methods concerning the ABSA have 
been proposed, some of them are supervised, and 
others unsupervised.  The earliest work on aspect 
detection from on-line reviews presented by Hu 
and Liu used association rule mining based on 
Apriori algorithm to extract frequent noun 
phrases as product features, they used two seed 
sets of 30 positive and negative adjectives, then 
WordNet has been used to find and add the seed 
words synonyms. Infrequent aspects had been 
processed by finding the noun related to an opin-
ionated word (Hu and Liu 2004). 
Opinion Digger (Moghaddam and Ester 2010) 
used also Apriori algorithm to extract the fre-
quent aspects then it filters the non-aspects by 
applying a constraint -learned from the training 
data- on the extracted aspects. KNN algorithm is 
applied to estimate the aspect rating scaling from 
1 to 5 stands for (Excellent, Good, Average, 
Poor, Terrible), assuming that the sentiment is 
expressed by the nearest adjectives to the aspect 
term in the sentence segment, WordNet is used 
for finding the synonyms of sentiment word in 
order to use them to estimate the distance be-
tween it and the words of rating scale. 
Some unsupervised methods based on LDA 
(Latent Dirichlet allocation) were proposed. 
Brody and Elhadad used LDA to find the as-
pects, determined the number of topics by apply-
ing a clustering method (Brody and Elhadad 
2010), then they used a similar method proposed 
by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997) to extract 
the conjunctive adjectives but not the disjunctive 
due to the specificity of the domain, seed sets 
were used and assigned scores, these scores were 
propagated using propagation method through 
the aspect-sentiment graph building from the 
pairs of aspect and related adjectives. 
  Other works make one LDA based model for 
the aspect and sentiment extraction. Lin and He 
                                                 
1
 http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-
analysis.html#lexicon 
(Lin and He 2009)proposed Joint model of Sen-
timent and Topic (JST) which extends the state-
of-the-art topic model, Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) by adding a sentiment layer, this 
model is fully unsupervised and it can detect sen-
timent and topic simultaneously. 
Wei and Gulla (Wei and Gulla 2010) modelled 
the hierarchical relation between product aspects. 
They defined SOT Sentiment Ontology Tree to 
formulate the knowledge of hierarchical relation-
ships among product attributes and tackle the 
problem of sentiment analysis as a hierarchical 
classification problem. Unsupervised hierarchical 
aspect  
Sentiment model (HASM) was proposed by Kim 
et al (Kim, Zhang et al. 2013) to discover a hier-
archical structure of aspect-based sentiments 
from unlabelled online reviews. 
Supervised methods uses normally a CRF or 
HMM models. Jin and Ho (Jin and Ho 2009) 
applied a lexicalized HMM model to extract as-
pects using the words and their part-of-speech 
tags in order to learn a model, then unsupervised 
algorithm for determining the aspect sentiment 
using the nearest opinion word to the aspect and 
taking into account the polarity reversal words 
(such as not). CRF model was used by Jakob and 
Gurevych (Jakob and Gurevych 2010) with these 
features: tokens, POS tags, syntactic dependency 
(if the aspect has a relation with the opinionated 
word), word distance (the distance between the 
word in the closest noun phrase and the opinion-
ated word), and opinion sentences (each token in 
the sentence containing an opinionated expres-
sion is labelled by this feature), the input of this 
method is also the opinionated expressions, they 
use these expressions for predicting the aspect 
sentiment using the dependency parsing for re-
trieving the pair aspect-expression from the train-
ing set. 
Our method for aspect extraction is closed to 
(Jakob and Gurevych 2010), where we used CRF 
model with different features for aspect extrac-
tion, but another method for sentiment detection. 
The second and fourth subtasks are concerning 
the polarity detection, so besides to all previous 
discussed works, we can handle them as sentence 
level SA. We choose to use Multinomial Naive 
Bayes with some features (POS, Z-score, pre-
polarity). The most related work is (Hamdan, 
B?chet et al. 2013) where they used Naive Bays 
with WordNet, DBpedia and SentiWordNet fea-
tures.

3 The System 
Our system is composed of four subtasks: 
3.1 Subtask1: Aspect Terms Extraction 
The objective of this subtask is to extract all 
aspect terms in the review sentence, aspect terms 
could be a word or multiple words. For this pur-
pose we have used CRF (Conditional Random 
Field) which have been used for information ex-
traction. We choose the IOB notation, therefore 
we distinguish the terms at the Beginning, the 
Inside and the Outside of aspect term expression. 
Then, we propose 16 features, for each term we 
extract the following features: 
- Its root (Porter Stemmer); 
- Its POS tag; 
-The stemming roots for all three words before 
and after the term; 
-The POS tags for all three words before and 
after the term; 
- A feature indicates if the word starts with 
capital letter; 
-A feature indicates if the word is capitalised. 
For example, for this review ?But the staff was 
so horrible to us.? Where staff is the aspect term, 
the target of each word will be: 
 But:O the:O staff:B was:O so:O horrible:O to:O 
us:O. 
3.2 Subtask2: Aspect Term Polarity Detection 
This subtask can be seen as sentence level or 
phrase level sentiment Analysis, the first step (1) 
we should detect the context or the words related 
to the aspect term, then to compute its polarity 
according to these words. Dependency parsing 
could be used to determine these words or simple 
distance function. We extract the context of as-
pect term according to the syntax and other as-
pect terms. Therefore, the context is the term it-
self and all the surrounding terms enclosed be-
tween two separators (commas in general), if 
another aspect is also enclosed by these separa-
tors we consider it as a separator instead of the 
comma, and we do not take the terms after it or 
before it (according to its direction to the aspect 
term). If the sentence has only an aspect term the 
separators will be the beginning and the end of 
the sentence. For example, for this review ?It 
took half an hour to get our check, which was 
perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!? 
where we have two aspect terms drinks and 
check, the context of check will be ?It took half 
an hour to get our check? and the context of 
drinks will be ?have drinks and talk!?. Another 
example, ?All the money went into the interior 
decoration, none of it went to the chefs.? The 
context for interior decoration will be ?All the 
money went into the interior decoration? and the 
context for chefs will be ?none of it went to the 
chefs?. 
The second step (2) we should determine the 
polarity, which could be positive, negative, neu-
tral or conflict. We propose to use Multinomial 
Naive-Bayes for learning a classifier based on 
different features:  
- The terms in the sentence (term frequency); 
- The POS features (the number of adjectives, 
adverbs, verbs, nouns, connectors) 
- The pre-polarity features (the number of pos-
itive and negative words in the sentence ex-
tracted from Subjectivity lexicon and Bing 
Liu's Opinion Lexicon); 
- Z-score features (the number of words which 
have Z-score more than three in each senti-
ment class),  Z_score  is described in 3.3. 
3.3 Subtask3: Category Detection 
Determining the categories of each sentence 
can be seen as a multi-label classification prob-
lem at sentence level.  
We propose to use Z-score which is capable of 
distinguishing the importance of a term in a cate-
gory. The more the term is important in a catego-
ry the more its Z-score is high in this category 
and low in other categories in which it is not im-
portant. Thus, we compute the Z-score for all 
terms using the annotated data, then for each 
given sentence, the sum of Z-score over each 
category is computed if the Z-score of term in a 
category is less than zero, we ignore it in this 
category because it is not important, the sentence 
will be attributed to the category having the 
highest Z-score, if some categories have the 
same Z-scores the sentence will be attributed to 
the both. The algorithm steps: 
For each tem t in the sentence: 
For each category c: 
If z-score(t,c)>0: 
Z_sc[c]+= z-score(t,c) 
Categories=max(Z_sc) 
 
We assume that the term frequency follows the 
multinomial distribution. Thus, Z_score can be 
seen as a standardization of the term frequency. 
We compute Z score for each term ti in a class Cj 
(tij) by calculating its term relative frequency tfrij 
in a particular class Cj, as well as the mean 
598
(meani) which is the term probability over the 
whole corpus multiplied by nj the number of 
terms in the class Cj, and standard deviation (sdi) 
of term ti according to the underlying corpus (see 
Eq. (1,2)). 
 
Z?????????? =
???????????
??? Eq. (1) 
 
Z?????????? =
??????????(??)
?????(??)?(???(??))Eq. (2) 
 
 Z_score was exploited for SA by (Zubaryeva 
and Savoy 2010), they choose a threshold (Z>2) 
for selecting the number of terms having Z_score 
more than the threshold, then they used a logistic 
regression for combining these scores. We use 
Z_score as added features for multinomial Naive 
Bayes classifier. 
3.4 Subtask4:  Category Polarity Detection 
We have used Multinomial Naive-Bayes as in 
the subtask2 step (2) with the same features, but 
the different that we add also the name of the 
category as a feature. Thus, for each sentence 
having n category we add n examples to the 
training set, the difference between them is the 
feature of the category.  
4 Experiments and Evaluations 
We tested our system using the training and test-
ing data provided by SemEval 2014 ABSA task. 
Two data sets were provided; the first con-
tains3Ksentences of restaurant reviews annotated 
by the aspect terms, their polarities, their catego-
ries, the polarities of each category. The second 
contains of 3K sentences of laptop reviews anno-
tated just by the aspect terms, their polarities. 
The evaluation process was done in two steps. 
First step is concerning the subtasks 1 and 3 
which involves the aspect terms extraction and 
category detection, we were provided with res-
taurant review and laptop review sentences and 
we had to extract the aspect terms for both data 
sets and the categories for the restaurant one. 
Baseline methods were provided; Table1 demon-
strates the results of these subtasks in terms of 
precision P, recall R and f-measure F for our sys-
tem and the baseline2. 
We remark that our system is 24% and 21% 
above the baseline for aspect terms extraction in 
restaurant and laptop reviews respectively, and

pect terms, and categories, we had to determine 
the polarity for each aspect term and category; 
(2) laptop review sentences annotated by aspect 
terms and we had to determine the aspect term

We remark that our system is 8% and 13% above

taurant reviews. 
5 Conclusion 
We have built a system for Aspect-Based Sen-
timent Analysis; we proposed different super-
vised methods for the four sub-tasks. Our results 
are always above the baseline proposed by the 
organiser of SemEval. We proposed to use CRF 
for aspect term extraction, Z-score model for cat-
egory detection, Multinomial Naive-Bayes with 
some new features for polarity detection. We 
find that the use of Z-score is useful for the cate-
gory and polarity detection, we are going to test 
it in another sentiment analysis tasks of another 
domains.

Abstract 
Twitter has become more and more an im-
portant resource of user-generated data. Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter is interesting for 
many applications and objectives. In this pa-
per, we propose to exploit some features 
which can be useful for this task; the main 
contribution is the use of Z-scores as features 
for sentiment classification in addition to 
pre-polarity and POS tags features. Our ex-
periments have been evaluated using the test 
data provided by SemEval 2013 and 2014. 
The evaluation demonstrates that Z_scores 
features can significantly improve the predic-
tion performance. 
1 Introduction 
The interactive Web has changed the relation 
between the users and the web. Users have be-
come an important source of content. They ex-
press their opinion towards different issues. The-
se opinions are important for others who are in-
terested in understanding users? interests such as 
buyers, sellers and producers. 
 Twitter is one of the most important platforms in 
which the users express their opinions. Many 
works have exploited this media for predicting 
valuable issues depending on Sentiment Analysis 
(SA). The authors in (Asur and Huberman 2010) 
predicted the box-office revenues of movies in 
advance of their releases using the tweets talking 
about them. In (Bae and Lee 2012) Sentiment

Analysis has been used to study the impact of 13 
twitter accounts of famous persons on their fol-
lowers and also for forecasting the interesting 
tweets which are more probably to be reposted 
by the followers (Naveed, Gottron et al. 2011). 
Sentiment Analysis can be done in different lev-
els; Document level; Sentence level; Clause level 
or Aspect-Based level. SA in Twitter can be seen 
as a sentence level task, but some limitations 
should be considered in such sentences. The size 
of tweets is limited to 140 characters, informal 
language, emotion icons and non-standard ex-
pressions are commonly used, and many spelling 
errors can be found due to the absence of cor-
rectness verification. 
   Three different approaches can be identified in 
the literature of Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, 
the first approach is lexicon based, using specific 
types of lexicons to derive the polarity of a text, 
this approach suffers from the limited size of lex-
icon and requires human expertise to build man-
ual lexicon (Joshi, Balamurali et al. 2011), in the 
other hand the automatic lexicons are not so effi-
cient. The second one is machine learning ap-
proach which uses annotated texts with a given 
labels to learn a classification model, an early 
work was done on a movie review dataset (Pang, 
Lee et al. 2002). Both lexicon and machine learn-
ing approaches can be combined to achieve a 
better performance (Khuc, Shivade et al. 2012). 
These two approaches are used for SA task but 
the third one is specific for Twitter or social con-
tent, the social approach exploits social network 
properties and data for enhancing the accuracy of 
the classification (Speriosu, Sudan et al. 2011). 
    In this paper, we exploit machine learning al-
gorithm with the aid of some features: 
? The original Terms: the terms represent-
ing the tweet after the tokenization and  
stemming; 
636
? Pre-polarity features: the number of neg-
ative, positive and neutral words extract-
ed from two sentiment lexicons; 
? POS tags: the number of adjectives, con-
nectors, verbs, nouns, adverbs in the 
tweet; 
? Z-score: The numbers of terms having Z-
score value more than three for each 
class positive, negative and neutral. 
   We extended the original terms with these last 
features. We also constructed a dictionary for the 
abbreviations and the slang words used in Twit-
ter in order to overcome the ambiguity of the 
tweets.  We tested the performance of every pos-
sible combination of these features. 
     The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 outlines previous work that focused on 
sentiment analysis in Twitter. Section 3 presents 
the Z_score features and the others which we 
used for training a classifier. Our experiments are 
described in section 4, conclusion and future 
work is presented in section 5. 
2 Related Works 
We can identify three main approaches for sen-
timent analysis in Twitter. The lexicon based 
approaches which depend on sentiment lexicons 
containing positive, negative and neutral words 
or expressions; they calculate the polarity ac-
cording to the number of common opinionated 
words between the lexicons and the text. Many 
dictionaries have been created manually such as 
ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) or 
automatically such as SentiWordNet 
(Baccianella, Esuli et al. 2010). Four lexicon dic-
tionaries were used to overcome the lack of 
words in each one (Joshi, Balamurali et al. 2011; 
Mukherjee, Malu et al. 2012). Automatically 
construction of a Twitter lexicon was imple-
mented by (Khuc, Shivade et al. 2012). 
      Machine learning approaches were employed 
from annotated tweets by using Naive Bayes, 
Maximum Entropy MaxEnt and Support Vector 
Machines (SVM). The authors (Go, Bhayani et 
al. 2009) reported that SVM outperforms other 
classifiers. They tried a unigram and a bigram 
model in conjunction with parts-of-speech (POS) 
features; they noted that the unigram model out-
performs all other models when using SVM and 
that POS features decrease the quality of results. 
The authors in (Kouloumpis, Wilson et al. 2011) 
found that N-gram with lexicon features and mi-
cro-blogging features are useful but POS features 
are not.  In contrast, in (Pak and Paroubek 2010) 
they reported that POS and bigrams both help. In 
(Barbosa and Feng 2010) the authors proposed 
the use of syntax features of tweets like retweet, 
hashtags, link, punctuation and exclamation 
marks in conjunction with features like prior po-
larity of words and POS tags, in (Agarwal, Xie et 
al. 2011) this approach was extended by using 
real valued prior polarity and by combining prior 
polarity with POS. Authors in (Saif, He et al. 
2012) proposed to use the semantic features, 
therefore they extracted the named entities in the 
tweets. Authors in (Hamdan, B?chet et al. 2013) 
used the concepts extracted from DBpedia and 
the adjectives from WordNet, they reported that 
the DBpedia concepts are useful with Na?ve-
Bayes classifier but less useful with SVM. 
     The third main approach takes into account 
the influence of users on their followers and the 
relation between the users and the tweets they 
wrote. It assumes that using the Twitter follower 
graph might improve the polarity classification. 
In (Speriosu, Sudan et al. 2011) they demonstrat-
ed that using label propagation with Twitter fol-
lower graph improves the polarity classification. 
In  (Tan, Lee et al. 2011) they employed social 
relation for user-level sentiment analysis. In (Hu, 
Tang et al. 2013) a Sociological Approach to 
handling the Noisy and short Text (SANT) for 
supervised sentiment classification is used; they 
reported that social theories such as Sentiment 
Consistency and Emotional Contagion could be 
helpful for sentiment analysis. 
3 Feature Selection 
We used different types of features in order to 
improve the accuracy of sentiment classification. 
- Bag of words (Terms) 
The most commonly used features in text analy-
sis are the bag of words which represent a text as 
unordered set of words or terms. It assumes that 
words are independent from each other and also 
disregards their order of appearance. We 
stemmed the words using Porter Stemmer and 
used them as a baseline features.  
 
- Z_score Features (Z) 
We suggest using a new type of features for Sen-
timent Analysis, Z_score can distinguish the im-
portance of each term in each class. We compute 
the number of terms having Z_score more than 
three for each class over each tweet. We assume 
that the term frequencies follow the multinomial 
distribution. Thus, Z_score can be seen as a 
standardization of the term. We compute the 
637
Z_score for each term ti in a class Cj (tij) by cal-
culating its term relative frequency tfrij in a par-
ticular class Cj, as well as the mean (meani) 
which is the term probability over the whole cor-
pus multiplied by nj the number of terms in the 
class Cj, and standard deviation (sdi) of term ti 
according to the underlying corpus (see Eq. 
(1,2)).  
 
Z?????????? =
???????????
???              Eq. (1) 
 
Z?????????? =
??????????(??)
?????(??)?(???(??))   Eq. (2) 
 
 The term which has salient frequency in a class 
in compassion to others will have a salient 
Z_score. Z_score was exploited for SA by 
(Zubaryeva and Savoy  2010) , they choose a 
threshold (>2) for selecting the number of terms 
having Z_score more than the threshold, then 
they used a logistic regression for combining 
these scores. We use Z_scores as added features 
for classification because the tweet is too short, 
therefore many tweets does not have any words 
with salient Z_score. The three following figures 
1,2,3 show the distribution of Z_score over each 
class, we remark that the majority of terms has 
Z_score between -1.5 and 2.5 in each class and 
the rest are either vey frequent (>2.5) or very rare 
(<-1.5). It should indicate that negative value 
means that the term is not frequent in this class in 
comparison with its frequencies in other classes. 
Table1 demonstrates the first ten terms having 
the highest Z_scores in each class. We have test-
ed to use different values for the threshold, the 
best results was obtained when the threshold is 3.

-  Sentiment Lexicon Features (POL) 
We used two sentiment lexicons, MPQA Subjec-
tivity Lexicon(Wilson, Wiebe et al. 2005) and 
Bing Liu's Opinion Lexicon which is created by 
(Hu and Liu 2004) and augmented in many latter 
works. We extract the number of positive, nega-
tive and neutral words in tweets according to the-
se lexicons. Bing Liu's lexicon only contains 
negative and positive annotation but Subjectivity 
contains negative, positive and neutral. 
 
- Part Of Speech (POS) 
We annotate each word in the tweet by its POS 
tag, and then we compute the number of adjec-
tives, verbs, nouns, adverbs and connectors in 
each tweet. 
4 Evaluation 
4.1 Data collection 
  We used the data set provided in SemEval 2013 
and 2014 for subtask B of sentiment analysis in 
Twitter(Rosenthal, Ritter et al. 2014) (Wilson, 
Kozareva et al. 2013). The participants were 
provided with training tweets annotated as posi-
tive, negative or neutral. We downloaded these 
tweets using a given script. Among 9646 tweets, 
we could only download 8498 of them because 
of protected profiles and deleted tweets. Then, 
we used the development set containing 1654 
tweets for evaluating our methods. We combined 
the development set with training set and built a 
new model which predicted the labels of the test 
set 2013 and 2014.  
 
4.2 Experiments 
 
Official Results 
   The results of our system submitted for 
SemEval evaluation gave 46.38%, 52.02% for 
test set 2013 and 2014 respectively. It should 
mention that these results are not correct because 
of a software bug discovered after the submis-
sion deadline, therefore the correct results is 
demonstrated as non-official results. In fact the 
previous results are the output of our classifier 
which is trained by all the features in section 3, 
but because of index shifting error the test set 
was represented by all the features except the 
terms. 
 
Non-official Results 
  We have done various experiments using the 
features presented in Section 3 with Multinomial 
Na?ve-Bayes model. We firstly constructed fea-
ture vector of tweet terms which gave 49%, 46% 
for test set 2013, 2014 respectively. Then, we 
augmented this original vector by the Z_score 
638
features which improve the performance by 6.5% 
and 10.9%, then by pre-polarity features which 
also improve the f-measure by 4%, 6%, but the 
extending with POS tags decreases the f-
measure. We also test all combinations with the-
se previous features, Table2 demonstrates the 
results of each combination, we remark that POS 
tags are not useful over all the experiments, the 
best result is obtained by combining Z_score and 
pre-polarity features. We find that Z_score fea-
tures improve significantly the f-measure and 
they are better than pre-polarity features.

We repeated all previous experiments after using 
a twitter dictionary where we extend the tweet by 
the expressions related to each emotion icons or 
abbreviations in tweets. The results in Table3 
demonstrate that using that dictionary improves 
the f-measure over all the experiments, the best 
results obtained also by combining Z_scores and 
pre-polarity features.

5 Conclusion 
  In this paper we tested the impact of using 
Twitter Dictionary, Sentiment Lexicons, Z_score 
features and POS tags for the sentiment classifi-
cation of tweets. We extended the feature vector 
of tweets by all these features; we have proposed 
new type of features Z_score and demonstrated 
that they can improve the performance. 
We think that Z_score can be used in different 
ways for improving the Sentiment Analysis, we 
are going to test it in another type of corpus and 
using other methods in order to combine these 
features.
