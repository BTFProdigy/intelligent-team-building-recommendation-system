Abstract
This paper describes our system in the shared
task of CoNLL-2013. We illustrate that gram-
matical error detection and correction can be
transformed into a multiclass classification
task and implemented as a single-model sys-
tem regardless of various error types with the
aid of maximum entropy modeling. Our sys-
tem achieves the F1 score of 17.13% on the
standard test set.
1 Introduction and Task Description
Grammatical error correction is the task of auto-
matically detecting and correcting erroneous word
usage and ill-formed grammatical constructions in
text (Dahlmeier et al, 2012). This task could be help-
ful for hundreds of millions of people around the world
that are learning English as a second language. Al-
though there have been much of work on grammatical
error correction, the current approaches mainly focus
on very limited error types and the result is far from
satisfactory.
The CoNLL-2013 shared task, compared with the
previous Help Our Own (HOO) tasks focusing on only
determiner and preposition errors, considers a more
comprehensive list of error types, including determiner,
preposition, noun number, verb form, and subject-
verb agreement errors. The evaluation metric used in
CoNLL-2013 is Max-Matching (M2) (Dahlmeier and
Ng, 2012) precision, recall and F1 between the system
edits and a manually created set of gold-standard ed-
its. The corpus used in CoNLL-2013 is NUS Corpus
of Learner English (NUCLE) of which the details are
described in (Dahlmeier et al, 2013).
In this paper, we describe the system submission

sity (SJT1). Grammatical error detection and correc-
tion problem is treated as multiclass classification task.
Unlike previous works (Dahlmeier et al, 2012; Ro-
zovskaya et al, 2012; Kochmar et al, 2012) that train
a model upon each error type, we use one single model
for all error types. Instead of the original error type, a
more detailed version of error types is used as class la-
bels. A rule based system generates labels from the
golden edits utilizing an extended version of Leven-
shtein edit distance. We use maximum entropy (ME)
model as classifier to obtain the error types and use
rules to do the correction. Corrections are made us-
ing rules. Finally, the corrections are filtered using lan-
guage model (LM).
2 System Architecture
Our system is a pipeline of grammatical error detection
and correction. We treats grammatical error detection
as a classification task. First all the tokens are relabeled
according to the golden annotation and a sequence of
modified version of error types is generated. This re-
labeling task is rule based using an extended version
of Levenshtein edit distance which will be discussed
in the following section. Then with the modified error
types as the class labels, a classifier using ME model
is trained. The grammatical error correction is also
rule based, which is basically the reverse of the rela-
beling phase. The modefied version of error types that
we used is much more detailed than the original five
types so that it enables us to use one rule to do the cor-
rection for each modified error type. After all, the cor-
rections are filtered by LM, to remove those corrections
that seem much worse than the original sentence.
As typical classification task, we have a training step
and a test step. The training step consists three phases:
? Error types relabeling.
? Training data refinement.
? ME training.
The test step includes three phases:
? ME classification.
74
? Error correction according to lebels.
? LM filtering.
2.1 Rebeling by Levenshtein Edit Distance
with Inflection
In CoNLL-2013 there are 5 error types but they cannot
be used directly as class labels, since they are too gen-
eral for error correction. For example, the verb form
error includes all verb form inflections such as con-
verting a verb to its infinitive form, gerund form, paste
tense, paste participle, passive voice and so on. Previ-
ous approaches (Dahlmeier et al, 2012; Rozovskaya et
al., 2012; Kochmar et al, 2012) manually decompose
each error types to more detailed ones. For example,
in (Dahlmeier et al, 2012), the determinater error is
decomposed into:
? replacement determiner (RD): { a? the }
? missing determiner (MD): { ?? a }
? unwanted determiner (UD): { a? ? }
For limited error types such as merely determinatives
error and preposition error in HOO 2012, manually de-
composition may be sufficient. But for CoNLL-2013
with 5 error types including complicated verb inflec-
tion, an automatic method to decompose error types is
needed. We present an extended version of Levenshtein
edit distance to decompose error types into more de-
tailed class labels and relabel the input with the labels
generated.
The original Levenshtein edit distance has 4 edit
types: unchange (U), addition (A), deletion (D) and
substitution (S). We extend the ?substitution? edit
into two types of edits: inflection (I) and the orig-
nal substitution (S). To judge whether two words can
be inflected from each other, the extended algorithm
needs lemmas as input. If the two words have the
same lemma, they can be inflected from each other.
The extended Levenshtein edit distance with inflec-
tion is shown in Algorithm 1. It takes the source to-
kens toksrc, destination tokens tokdst and their lemmas
lemsrc, lemdst as input and returns the edits E and the
parameters of edits P. For example, for the golden edit
{look? have been looking at}, the edits E returned by
DISTANCE will be {A,A,U ,A}, and the parameters
P of edits returned by DISTANCE will be {have, been,
looking, at}.
Then with the output of DISTANCE, the labels can
be generated by calculating the edits between original
text and golden edits. For those tokens without errors,
we directly assign a special label ??? to them. The
tricky part of the relabeling algorithm is the problem
of the edit ?addition?, A. A new token can only be
added before or after an existing token. Thus for la-
bels with addition, we must find some token that the
label can be assigned to. That sort of token is defined
as pivot. A pivot can be a token that is not changed in

an edit, such as the ?apple? in edit {apple ? an ap-
ple}, or some other types of edit such as the inflection
of ?look? to ?looking? in edit {look? have been look-
75
ing at}. In the CoNLL-2013 task, the addition edits are
mostly adding articles or determinaters, so when gener-
ating the label, adding before the pivot is preferred and
only those trailing edits are added after the last pivot.
At last, the label is normalized to upper case.
The BNF syntax of labels is defined in Figure 1. The
the non-terminal ?inflection-rules? can be substituted
by terminals of inflection rules that are used for cor-
recting the error types of noun number, verb form, and
subject-verb agreement errors. All the inflection rules
are listed in Table 1. The ?stop-word? can be subsi-
tuted by terminals of stop words which contains all ar-
ticles, determinnaters and prepositions for error types
of determiner and preposition, and a small set of other
common stop words. All the stop words are listed in
Table 2.

Figure 1: BNF syntax of label
Algorithm 2 is used to generate the label from the
extended Levenshtein edits according to the syntax de-
fined in Figure 1. It takes the original tokens, tokorig
and golden edit tokens, tokgold in an annotation and
their lemmas, lemorig, lemgold as input and returns the
generated label L. For our previous example of edit
{looked ? have been looking at}, the L returned by
RELABEL is {HAVE?BEEN?GERUND?AT}. Some
other examples of relabeling are demonstrated in Ta-
ble 3.
The correction step is done by rules according to the
labels. The labels are parsed with a simple LL(1) parser
and edits are made according to labels. A bit of extra
work has to be taken to handle the upper/lower case
problem. For additions and substitutions, the words
added or substituted are normalized to lowercase. For
inflections, original case of words are reserved. Then
a bunch of regular expressions are applied to correct
upper/lower case for sentence head.

2.2 Training Corpus Refinement
The corpus used to train the grammatical error recog-
nition model is highly imbalanced. The original train-
ing corpus has 57,151 sentences and only 3,716 of
them contain at least one grammatical error, and only
5,049 of the total 1,161K words are needed to be cor-
rected. This characteristic makes it hard to get a well-
performed machine learning model, since the samples
to be recognized are so sparse and those large amount
of correct data will severely affect the machine learn-
ing process as it is an optimization on the global train-
ing data. While developing our system, we found
that only using sentences containing grammatical er-
rors will lead to a notable improvement of the result.

21: L? ??
22: end if
23: end while
24: L? upper case of L
25: return L
26: end function
Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a method to
refine the training corpus which will reduce the error
sparsity of the training data and notably improve the
recall rate.
The refined training corpus is composed of contexts
containing grammatical errors. To keep the informa-
tion which may have effects on the error identification
and classification, those contexts are selected based on
both syntax tree and n-gram, of which the process is
shown in Algorithm 3. For a word with error, its syntax
context of size c is those words in the minimal subtree
in the syntax tree with no less than c leaf nodes; and its
n-gram context of size n is n? 1 words before and af-
ter itself. In the CORPUSREFINE algorithm, the input c
gives the size of syntax context and n provides the size
of the n-gram context. These two parameters decide
the amount of information that may affect the recogni-
tion of errors. To obtain the context, given a sentence
containing a grammatical error, we first get a minimum
syntax tree whose number of terminal nodes exceed the
c threshold, then check whether the achieved context
containing the error word?s n-gram, if not, add the n-
gram to the context. At last the context is returned by
CORPUSREFINE.
An example illustrating this process is presented in
Figure 2. In this example, n and c are both set to 5,

the minimal syntax tree and the context decided by it
are colored in green. Since the syntax context in the
green frame does not contain the error word?s 5-gram,
therefore, the 5-gram context in the blue frame is added
to the syntax context and the final achieved context of
this sentence is ?have to stop all works for the develop-
ment?.
2.3 LM Filter
All corrections are filtered using a large LM. Only
those corrections that are not too much worse than the
original sentences are accepted. Perplexity (PPL) of the
n-gram is used to judge whether a sentence is good:
PPL = 2?
?
w?n-gram p(w) log p(w),
We use rPPL, the ratio between the PPL before and
after correction, as a metric of information gain.
rPPL =
PPLcorrected
PPLoriginal
,
Only those corrections with an rPPL lower than a cer-
tain threshold are accepted.

3 Features
The single model approach enables us only to optimize
one feature set for all error type in the task, which can
drastically reduce the computational cost in feature se-
lection.
As many previous works have proposed various of
features, we first collected features from different pre-
vious works including (Dahlmeier et al, 2012; Ro-
zovskaya et al, 2012; HAN et al, 2006; Rozovskaya
et al, 2011; Tetreault, Joel R and Chodorow, Martin,
2008). Then experiments with different features were
built to test these features? effectiveness and only those
have positive contribution to the final performance
were preserved. The features we used are presented in
Table 4, where word0 is the word that we are generat-
ing features for, and word and POS is the word itself
and it?s POS tag for various components. NPHead de-
notes the head of the minimum Noun Phrase (NP) in
syntax tree. wordNP?1 represents the word appearing
before NP in the sentence. NC stands for noun com-
pound and is composed of the last n words (n ? 2)
in NP which are tagged as a noun. Verb feature is
the word that is tagged as a verb whose direct object
is the NP containing current word. Adj feature repre-
sents the first word in the NP whose POS is adjective.
Prep feature denotes the preposition word if it imme-
diately precedes the NP. DPHead is the parent of the
current word in the dependency tree, and DPRel is the
dependency relation with parent.
4 Experiments
4.1 Data Sets
The CoNLL-2013 training data consist of 1,397 arti-
cles together with gold-standard annotation. The docu-
ments are a subset of the NUS Corpus of Learner En-
glish (NUCLE) (Dahlmeier et al, 2013). The official
test data consists of 50 new essays which are also from
NUCLE. The first 25 essays were written in response to
one prompt. The remaining 25 essays were written in
response to a second prompt. One of the prompts had
been used for the training data, while the other prompt
is new. More details of the data set are described in (Ng
et al, 2013).
We split the the entire training corpus ALL by article.
For our training step, we randomly pick 90% articles of
ALL and build a training corpus TRAIN of 1,258 arti-
cles. The rest 10% of ALL with 139 articles are for
developing corpus DEV .
For the final submission, we use the entire corpus
ALL for relabeling and training.

4.2 Resources
We use the following NLP resources in our sys-
tem. For relabeling and correction, perl mod-
ule Lingua::EN::Inflect1 (Conway, 1998) is used
for determining noun and verb number and Lin-
gua::EN::VerbTense2 is used for determining verb
tense. A revised and extended version of maxi-
mum entropy model3 is used for ME modeling. For
lemmatization, the Stanford CoreNLP lemma annota-
tor (Toutanova et al, 2003; Toutanova and Manning,
2000) is used. The language model is built by the
SRILM toolkit (Stolcke and others, 2002). The corpus
for building LM is the EuroParl corpus (Koehn, 2005).
The English part of the German-English parallel cor-
pus is actually used. We use such a corpus to build
LM for the following reasons: 1. LM for grammatical
error correction should be trained from corpus that it-
self is grammatically correct, and the EuroParl corpus
has very good quality of writing; 2. the NUCLE cor-
pus mainly contains essays on subjects such as environ-
ment, economics, society, politics and so on, which are
in the same dormain as those of the EuroParl corpus.
4.3 Relabeling the Corpus
There are some complicated edits in the annotations
that can not be represented by our rules, for example
substitution of non-stopwords such as {human? peo-
ple} or {are not short of? do not lack}. The relabel-
ing phase will ignore those ones thus it may not cover
all the edits. After all, we get 174 labels after relabel-
ing on the entire corpus as shown in Table 6. These
labels are generated following the syntax defined in
Figure1 and terminals defined in Table 1 and Table 2.
Directly applying these labels for correction receives an
M2 score of Precission = 91.43%,Recall = 86.92%
and F1 = 89.12%. If the non-stopwords non-inflection
edits are included, of course the labels will cover all the
golden annotations and directly applying labels for cor-
rection can receive a score up to almost F1 = 100%.
But that will get nearly 1,000 labels which is too com-
putationally expensive for a classification task. Cut out
labels with very low frequency such as those exists only
once reduces the training time, but does not give signif-
icant performance improvement, since it hurts the cov-
erage of error detection. So we use all the labels for
training.
4.4 LM Filter Threshold
To choose the threshold for rPPL, we run a series of
tests on the DEV set with different thresholds. From
our empirical observation on those right corrections
and those wrong ones, we find the right ones seldomly

have rPPL > 2, so we test thresholds ranging from 1.5
to 3. The curves are shown in Figure 3.

With higher threshold, more correction with lower
information gain will be obtained. Thus the recall
grows higher but the precission grows lower. We can
observe a peak of F1 arround 1.8 to 2.0, and the thresh-
old chosen for final submission is 1.91.
4.5 Evaluation and Result
The evaluation is done by calculating the M2 precis-
sion, recall and F1 score between the system output
and golden annotation. All the error types are evalu-
ated jointly. Only one run of a team is permitted to be
submitted. Table 7 shows our result on our DEV data
set and the official test data set.

standard edits.

Abstract
This paper describes the system of Shang-
hai Jiao Tong Unvierity team in the
CoNLL-2014 shared task. Error correc-
tion operations are encoded as a group of
predefined labels and therefore the task
is formulized as a multi-label classifica-
tion task. For training, labels are obtained
through a strict rule-based approach. For
decoding, errors are detected and correct-
ed according to the classification results.
A single maximum entropy model is used
for the classification implementation in-
corporated with an improved feature selec-
tion algorithm. Our system achieved pre-
cision of 29.83, recall of 5.16 and F 0.5
of 15.24 in the official evaluation.
1 Introduction
The task of CoNLL-2014 is grammatical error cor-
rection which consists of detecting and correcting
the grammatical errors in English essays written
by non-native speakers (Ng et al., 2014). The re-
search of grammatical error correction can poten-
tially help millions of people in the world who are
learning English as foreign language. Although
there have been many works on grammatical error
correction, the current approaches mainly focus on
very limited error types and the result is far from
satisfactory.
The CoNLL-2014 shared task, compared with
the previous Help Our Own (HOO) tasks (Dale et
al., 2012) considering only determiner and prepo-
sition errors and the CoNLL-2013 shared task fo-

cusing on five major types of errors, requires to
correct all 28 types of errors (Ng et al., 2014).
One traditional strategy is designing a system
combined of a set of sub-models, where each sub-
model is specialized for a specific subtask, for ex-
ample, correcting one type of errors. This strat-
egy is computationally efficient and can adopt d-
ifferent favorable features for each subtask. Top
ranked systems in CoNLL-2013 (Rozovskaya et
al., 2013; Kao et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2013;
Yoshimoto et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2013) are
based on this strategy. However, the division of
the model relies on prior-knowledges and the de-
signing of different features for each sub-model
requires a large amount of manual works. This
shortage is especially notable in CoNLL-2014
shared task, since the number of error types is
much larger and the composition of errors is more
complicated than before.
In contrast, we follow the work in (Jia et al.,
2013a; Zhao et al., 2009a), integrating everything
into one model. This integrated system holds a
merit that a one-way feature selection benefits the
whole system and no additional process is needed
to deal with the conflict or error propagation of ev-
ery sub-models. Here is a glance of this method: A
set of more detailed error types are generated auto-
matically from the original 28 types of errors. The
detailed error type can be regarded as the label of
a word, thus the task of grammatical error detec-
tion is transformed to a multi-label classification
task using maximum entropy model (Berger et al.,
1996; Zhao et al., 2013). A feature selection ap-
proach is introduced to get effective features from
large amounts of feature candidates. Once errors
are detected through word label classification, a
rule-based method is used to make corrections ac-
cording to their labels.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the system architecture. Sec-
tion 3 introduces the feature selection approach
74
and the features we used. Experiments and result-
s are presented in section 5, followed by conclu-
sion.
2 System Architecture
In our approach, the grammatical error detection
is regarded as a multi-label classification task. At
first, each token in training corpus is assigned a la-
bel according to the golden annotation. The con-
struction of labels is rule based using an extend-
ed version of Levenshtein edit distance algorith-
m which will be discussed in the following sub-
section. Each label maps an edit operation to do
the correction, thus the generated labels are much
more detailed than the originial 28 error types.
Then, a maximum entropy (ME) model is adopted
as the classifier. With the labeled data, the process
of grammatical error correction is just applying the
edit operation mapped by each label, which is ba-
sically the reverse of the labeling phase.
2.1 Data Labeling
In CoNLL-2014 shared task, there are 28 error
types but they can not be used directly as class la-
bels, since these types are too general that they can
hardly be corrected by applying one rule-based
edit. For example, the correction of Vform (ver-
b form) error type includes all verb form inflec-
tions such as converting a verb to its infinitive for-
m, gerund form, past form and past participle and
so on. Previous works (Dahlmeier et al., 2012;
Rozovskaya et al., 2012; Kochmar et al., 2012)
manually decompose each error types to more de-
tailed subtypes. For example, in (Dahlmeier et al.,
2012), the determinater errors are decomposed in-
to:
? replacement determiner (RD): { a ? the }
? missing determiner (MD): { ? ? a }
? unwanted determiner (UD): { a ? ? }
For a task with a few error types such as merely
determinative and preposition error in HOO 2012,
manually decomposition may be sufficient. How-
ever, for CoNLL-2014, all 28 error types are re-
quired to be corrected and some of these types
such as Rloc- (Local redundancy) and Um (Un-
clear meaning) are quite complex that the manu-
al decomposition is time consuming and requires
lots of grammatical knowledges. Therefore, an au-
tomatica decomposition method is proposed. It is
extended from the Levenshtein edit distance algo-
rithm and can divide error types into more detailed
subtypes that each subtype can be corrected by ap-
plying one simple rule. How to calculate the ex-
tended Levenshtein edit distance is described in
Algorithm 1.

return (E,P)
In this algorithm, toks
src
represents the tokens
that are annotated with one grammatical error and
toks
dst
represents the corrected tokens of toks
src
.
At first, three two dimensional matrixes D, B and
75
E are initialized. For all i and j, D[i][j] holds
the Levenshtein distance between the first i tokens
of toks
src
and first j tokens of toks
dst
. B stores
the path of the Levenshtein distance and E stores
the edit operations in this path. The original Lev-
enshtein edit distance has 4 edit operations: un-
change (U ), addition (A), deletion (D) and substi-
tution (S). We extend the ?substitution? edit into
two types of edits: inflection (I) and the original
substitution (S). If two different words have the
same lemma, the substitution operation is I, else is
S. lemma(x) returns the lemma of token x. This
algorithm returns the edit operations E and the pa-
rameters of these operations P. Here is a simple
sample illustrating this algorithm. For the golden
edit {a red apple is ? red apples are}, toks
src
is
a red apple is, toks
dst
is red apples are, the output
edits E will be {D,U , I,S}, and the parameters P
will be {-, red, apples, are}.
Then with the output of this extended Leven-
shtein distance algorithm, labels can be generated
by transforming these edit operations into readable
symbols. For those tokens without errors, we di-
rectly assign a special label ??? to them. A tricky
part of the labeling process is the problem of the
edit ?addition?,A. A new token can only be added
before or after an existing token. Thus for edit op-
eration with addition, we must find an existing to-
ken that the label can be assigned to, and this sort
of token is defined as pivot. A pivot can be a token
that is not changed in an edit operation, such as the
?apple? in edit {apple ? an apple}, or some oth-
er types of edit such as the inflection of ?look? to
?looking? in edit {look ? have been looking at}.
The names of these labels are based on BNF
syntax which is defined in Figure 1. The non-
terminal ?word? can be substituted by all words
in the vocabulary. The non-terminal ?inflection-
rules? can be substituted by terminals of inflection
rules that are used for correcting the error types of
noun number, verb form, and subject-verb agree-
ment errors. All the inflection rules are listed in
Table 1.
With the output of extended Levenshtein edits
distance algorithm, Algorithm 2 gives the process
to generate labels whose names are based on the
syntax defined in Figure 1. It takes the output E, P
of Algorithm 1 as inputs and returns the generat-
ed set of labels L. Each label in L corresponds to
one token in toks
src
in order. For our previous ex-
ample of edit {a red apple is ? red apples are},
?label? ::= ?simple-label? | ?compound-label?
?simple-label? ::= ?pivot? | ?add-before? |

These labels are elaborately designed that each
of them can be interpreted easily as a series of ed-
it operations. Once the labels are determined by
classifier, the correction of the grammatical errors
is conducted by applying the edit operations inter-
preted from these labels.

2.2 Label Classification
Using the approach described above, the training
corpus is converted to a sequence of words with
labels. Maximum entropy model is used as the
classifier. It allows a very rich set of features to be
used in a model and has shown good performance
in similiar tasks (Zhao et al., 2013). The features
we used are discussed in the next section.
3 Feature Selection and Generation
One key factor affecting the performance of maxi-
mum entropy classifier is the features it used. A
good feature that contains useful information to
guide classification will significantly improve the
performance of the classifier. One direct way to
involve more good features is involving more fea-
tures.
In our approach, large amounts of candidate
features are collected at first. We carefully exam-
ine the factors involved in a wide range of fea-
tures that have been or can be used to the word
label classification task. Many features that are
considered effective in various of previous work-
s (Dahlmeier et al., 2012; Rozovskaya et al.,
2012; Han et al., 2006; Rozovskaya et al., 2011;
Tetreault, Joel R and Chodorow, Martin, 2008)
are included. Besides, features that are used in
the similar spell checking tasks (Jia et al., 2013b;
Yang et al., 2012) and some novel features show-
ing effectiveness in other NLP tasks (Wang et al.,
2013; Zhang and Zhao, 2013; Xu and Zhao, 2012;
Ma and Zhao, 2012; Zhao, 2009; Zhao et al.,
2009b) are also included. However, using too
many features is time consuming. Besides, it in-
creases the probability of overfitting and may lead
to a poor solution of the maximum-likelihood pa-
rameter estimate in the ME training.
Algorithm 3 Greedy Feature Selection
1: INPUT: all feature candidates F
2: OUTPUT: selected features S
3: S = {f
0
, f

, . . . , f

}, a random subset of F
4: while do
5: C = RECRUITMORE(S)
6: if C = {} then
7: return S
8: end if
9: S
?
= SHAKEOFF(S+C)
10: if scr(M(S)) ? scr(M(S
?
)) then
11: return S
12: end if
13: S = S
?
14: end while
15: function RECRUITMORE(S)
16: C = {}, and p = scr(M(S))
17: for each f ? F ? S do
18: if p < scr(M(S + {f})) then
19: C = C + {f}
20: end if
21: end for
22: end function
23: function SHAKEOFF(S)
24: while do
25: S
?
= S
0
= S
26: for each f ? S do
27: if scr(M(S
?
)) < scr(M(S
?
? {f})) then
28: S
?
= S
?
? {f}
29: end if
30: end for
31: S = S
?
32: if S
?
= S
0
then
33: return S
?
34: end if
35: end while
36: end function
Therefore a feature selection algorithm is intro-
duced to filter out ?bad? features at first and the re-
maining features will be used to generate new fea-
tures. The feature selection algorithm has shown
77
effectiveness in (Zhao et al., 2013) and is present-
ed in Algorithm 3.
In this algorithm, M(S) represents the model
using feature set S and scr(M) represents the e-
valuation score of model M on a development da-
ta set. It repeats two main steps until no further
performance gain is achievable:
1. Include any features from the rest of F into
the current set of candidate features if the in-
clusion would lead to a performance gain.
2. Exclude any features from the current set of
candidate templates if the exclusion would
lead to no deterioration in performance.
By repeatedly adding the useful and removing
the useless features, the algorithm aims to return
a better and smaller set of features for next round.
Only 55 of the 109 candidate features remain af-
ter using this algorithm and they are presented in
Table 4. Table 3 gives an interpretation of the ab-
breviations used in Table 4. Each feature of a word
is set to that listed in feature column if the word
satisfies the condition listed in current word col-
umn, else the feature is set to ?NULL?. For ex-
ample, if the current word satisfies the condition
in the first row of Table 4 which is the first word
in the left of a NC, feature 1 of this word is set to
all words in the NC, otherwise, feature 1 is set to
?NULL?.

4.1 Data Sets
The CoNLL-2014 training data is a corpus of
learner English provided by (Dahlmeier et al.,
2013). This corpus consists of 1,397 articles, 12K
sentences and 116K tokens. The official blind test
data consists of 50 articles, 245 sentences and 30K
tokens. More detailed information about this data
is described in (Ng et al., 2014; Dahlmeier et al.,
2013).
In development phase, the entire training corpus
is splited by sentence. 80% sentences are picked
up randomly and used for training and the rest
20% are used as the developing corpus. For the fi-
nal submission, the entire corpus is used for train-
ing.

4.2 Data Labeling
The labeling algorithm described in section 2.1 is
firstly applied to the training corpus. Total 7047
labels are generated and those whose count is larg-
er than 15 is presented in Table 5. Directly ap-
plying these 7047 labels for correction receives an
M
2
score of precision=90.2%, recall=87.0% and
F 0.5=89.5%. However, the number of labels
is too large that the training process is time con-
suming and those labels appears only few times
will hurt the generalization of the trained model.
Therefore, labels with low frequency which ap-
pear less than 30 times are cut out and 109 labels
remain. The M
2
score of the system using this re-
fined labels is precision=83.9%, recall=64.0% and
F 0.5=79.0%. Note that even applying all labels,
the F 0.5 is not 100%. It is because some annota-
tions in the training corpus are not consistency.

4.3 Data Refinement
The training corpus is refined before used that sen-
tences which do not contain errors are filtered out.
Only 38% of the total sentences remain. With less
training corpus, it takes less time to train the ME
model. Table 7 presents the performance of sys-
tems using the unrefined training corpus and re-
fined corpus.
System Presicion Recall F 0.5
unrefined 26.99% 1.67% 6.71%
refined 11.17% 3.1% 7.34%
Table 7: Comparison of systems with differen-
t training corpus.
All sets of these systems are kept the same ex-
cept the training corpus they use. It can be seen
that the refinement also improves the performance
of the system.
4.4 Feature Selection
Figure 2 shows the results of systems with dif-
ferent feature sets. sys 10 is the system with
Figure 2: Performance of systems with different
features.
10 randomly chosen features which are used as
the initial set of features in Algorithm 3, sys 55
is the system with the refined 55 features. With
these refined features, various of new features are
generated by combining different features. This
combination is conducted empirically that features
which are considered having relations are com-
bined to generate new features. Using this method,
165 new features are generated and total 220 fea-
tures are used in sys 220. Table 6 gives a few
of examples showing the combined features. The
performance is evaluated by the precision, recal-
l and F 0.5 score of the M
2
scorer according
to (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012). It can be seen
that sys 220 with the most number of features
achieves the best performance.
4.5 Evaluation Result
The final system we use is sys 220 with refined
training data, the performance of our system on the
developing corpus and the blind official test data is
presented in Table 8. The score is calculated using
M

scorer.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we describe the system of Shang-
hai Jiao Tong Univerity team in the CoNLL-2014
shared task. The grammatical error detection is re-
garded as a multi-label classification task and the
correction is conducted by applying a rule-based
approach based on these labels. A single max-
imum entropy classifier is introduced to do the
multi-label classification. Various features are in-
volved and a feature selection algorithm is used
to refine these features. Finally, large amounts of
feature templates that are generated by the combi-
nation of the refined features are used. This system
achieved precision of 29.83%, recall of 5.16% and
F 0.5 of 15.24% in the official evaluation.
