Abstract
We present the Global Health Monitor, an 
online Web-based system for 
detecting and mapping infectious disease 
outbreaks that appear in news 
stories. The system analyzes English news 
stories from news feed providers, 
classifies them for topical relevance and 
plots them onto a Google map using 
geo-coding information, helping public 
health workers to monitor the spread 
of diseases in a geo-temporal context. The 
background knowledge for the 
system is contained in the BioCaster ontol-
ogy (BCO) (Collier et al, 2007a) 
which includes both information on infec-
tious diseases as well as 
geographical locations with their lati-
tudes/longitudes. The system consists 
of four main stages: topic classification, 
named entity recognition (NER), 
disease/location detection and visualiza-
tion. Evaluation of the system shows 
that it achieved high accuracy on a gold 
standard corpus. The system is now 
in practical use. Running on a cluster-
computer, it monitors more than 1500 
news feeds 24/7, updating the map every 
hour.
1 Introduction
Information concerning disease outbreak events is 
published in various news outlets on the World 
Wide Web, in many different languages.  Identify-
ing early news stories about disease outbreaks
automatically is important for a bio-surveillance 
system that is designed to inform health profes-
sionals. Currently, there are several systems avail-
able for the disease detection and tracking task. For 
example, ProMED-mail (2001) or MedISys (2007)
(Medical Intelligence System). ProMED-mail is an 
Internet-based system that provides reports by pub-
lic health experts concerning outbreak diseases 
(that is, the system is not automatic but rather hu-
man curated). In contrast to ProMED-mail, MedI-
Sys is an automatic system working on multilin-
gual languages, but it mainly focuses on analyzing 
news stories based on the country level. Another 
system which is close to the one we present is 
HealthMap (Brownstein and Freifeld, 
2007). HealthMap automatically collects news 
from the Internet about human and animal health 
and plots the data on a Google Maps mashup. Data 
is aggregated by disease and location. Unlike 
HealthMap, our system takes an ontology-centred 
approach to knowledge understanding and linkage 
to external resources. For annotation of topics and 
entities we also exploit a range of linguistic re-
sources within a machine learning framework.
There are several challenges in geo-coding when 
dealing with news stories. The two main chal-
lenges are disease/location extraction and geo-
disambiguation. The former is concerned with how 
to determine disease and location names for dis-
ease-related news stories. The latter is concerned 
with how to solve geo-disambiguation. For exam-
ple, if there is a news story about equine influenza 
in Camden, the system should detect that the dis-
ease name is ?equine influenza? and the location 
name is ?Camden?. However, there are two loca-
tions named Camden: One in Australia and one in 
951
London, UK. The problem is that only one location 
should be chosen for plotting into a map. In our 
opinion, current systems lack the advanced natural 
language processing and text mining techniques 
that would enable the automatic extraction of such 
disease/location event information.
BioCaster is a project working towards the detec-
tion and tracking of infectious diseases using text 
mining techniques. One of the main components is 
the BioCaster Ontology (BCO), which includes 50
infectious diseases with links to external vocabu-
lary resources, and a geographical ontology of a 
total of 243 countries and 4025 sub-countries 
(province and cities) with their lati-
tudes/longitudes. We also now automatically link 
news on outbreaks to academic sources such as
Stanford university?s Highwire and NCBI?s Pub-
Med using search terms Disease name + Location
name (Country) + ?case?. This is to ensure a focus 
on recent case report relevant to the news items.
The system includes four main stages: topic classi-
fication, named entity recognition (NER), dis-
ease/location detection, and visualization. The cur-
rent version of the system (English only) can be 
found at http://biocaster.nii.ac.jp.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 outlines the BioCaster Ontology 
(BCO). Section 3 describes some features of the 
system (modules, functionality and algorithms).  
Section 4 is concerned with system evaluation. 
Finally, Section 5 outlines conclusions and pre-
sents possible future work.
2 Overview of BCO
BCO is one of the main components in the Bio-
Caster project. It includes an ontology of 50 infec-
tious diseases and a geographical ontology (243 
countries and 4,025 sub-countries). The infectious 
disease ontology was built by a team consisting of
a linguist, an epidemiologist, a geneticist, and a 
medical anthropologist. A disease in BCO has a 
root name which is unique identifier and also other 
properties relating to synonyms, symptoms, asso-
ciated syndromes, hosts, etc. The ontology is mul-
tilingual, supporting six languages (English, Japa-
nese, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, and Chinese); and 
has links to external ontologies (such as MeSH,
SNOMED and ICD9/10) and resources (like 
Wikipedia). The geographical part is built from 
Wikipedia1. The BCO is available on the Web at 
http://biocaster.nii.ac.jp. For a fuller description of 
the BCO, see Collier et al (2007a) and Kawazoe et 
al. (2007).
3 The System
3.1 Overview of the system
The Global Health Monitor system runs on a clus-
ter machine with 16 nodes under the Linux operat-
ing system. The code was written in PHP, Perl, C, 
and Java and the number of input news feeds is 
about 1,500. The system has a crawler that collects 
news every hour. These collected news stories are 
then processed and analyzed step-by-step in four
main phases: topic classification, named entity 
recognition (NER), disease/location detection, and 
visualization. Each of the four phases is managed 
by a distinct module. These components are de-
picted in Figure 1. The first three modules are run 
inside the system and the visualization module ?
the Google Map ? can be seen at the BioCaster 
portal. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the system.

Figure 1. Stages of the system.

We will now describe each of the four modules in 
turn: 
* Topic classification.  This module identifies 
news stories with disease-related topics and retains 
relevant ones for later processing. The module uses
ontology-supported text classification with na?ve 
Bayes as the classification algorithm and the Bio-
Caster gold standard corpus as the training data set
(Doan et al, 2007). In this module, we used the 
Rainbow toolkit.2
* NER. Disease-related news stories are automati-
cally analyzed and tagged with NEs like PERSON, 
ORGANIZATION, DISEASE, LOCATION. This 
module is implemented by SVM classification al
                                                
2 Rainbow toolkit, available at 
http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/bow/rainbow
gorithm3. For a more detailed description of the 
schema and NER module, see Kawazoe et al 
(2006).
* Disease/location detection. This module extracts 
disease and location information. Details are given
in Section 3.2.
* Visualization. The detected locations are plotted 
onto a Google map with ontology links to associ-
ated diseases and news stories.
3.2 Disease/location detection algorithm
The disease/location detection algorithm is based 
on a statistical model of the LOCATION and DIS
EASE Named Entities (NEs). The algorithm can be 
described as follows:

screen is a Google Map. Selected headline reports run along the bottom of the screen and link to biomedi-
cal reference on PubMed, HighWire and Google Scholar.  Symbol    links to disease names in the BCO 
and symbol  stands for disease name not in the BCO. The right of the screen shows various user options 
to filter the news.
953
Input: A set of news stories tagged with NEs.
Output: A set of disease/location pairs.
Step 1: Detect LOCATION-DISEASE pairs in 
each news story by corresponding NEs, and calcu-
late their frequency in a news story.
Step 2: Calculate the frequency of LOCATION-
DISEASE pairs in a corpus.
Step 3: Rank LOCATION ? DISEASE pairs by 
the frequencies calculated in Step 2. Use a thresh-
old to choose top LOCATION - DISEASE names4. 
Step 4: Map disease and location names: If DIS-
EASE matches to a synonym in BCO then DIS-
EASE was assigned to that disease name. This 
process of matching (grounding the terms) allows
us to provide extra information from the ontology
and to remove variant forms of terms from the map
                                                
4 In the current system, we set the threshold value to 40.
? thereby aiding readability. Similarly, if LOCA-
TION matches to a location in BCO then LOCA-
TION was assigned to that location name. 
Step 5: Re-map into news stories: Match detected 
diseases and locations within the first half of each 
news story. If both disease and location are
matched then they are stored; otherwise, skip.
This five step process is repeated every hour, for 
each news article that is less than 1 day (24 hours) 
old.
3.3 Capabilities of the system
The following lists some capabilities of the current 
Global Health Monitor system.
* Date range: The system shows the dis-
ease/location and news stories within a specific
date range. Current implemented date ranges are:
30 days ago, 3 weeks ago, 2 weeks ago, 1 week 
ago, this week and today.
Figure 3.  The Global Health Monitor with the Respiratory Syndrome  selected. The time span selected is 
the current week.
954
* Genre filter: The system can show news stories 
by publication type. There are four genres of news: 
Press news (like Google News, Yahoo News), Of-
ficial news (like ProMED, WHO reports), Business 
news, and Mixed news (like Topix.com).
* Similar stories: The system currently uses a sim-
ple method to remove duplicate news stories. Users 
can use the ?Initial headline only? option to acti-
vate this function.
* Syndrome filter: There are six syndromes in 
BCO: Dermatological, Gastrointestinal, Hemor-
harrgic fever, Musculoskeletal, Neurological, and 
Respiratory. A syndrome can be associated with
several diseases included in BCO. The system can 
show news stories related to these syndromes.
* Agent option: This option allows users to view 
lists of infectious diseases which come from BCO. 
Some diseases though are not in the BCO. Users 
can choose some, all, or no diseases using a check-
box style interface.
Figure 3 shows the interface when users choose 
Syndromes as Respiratory for this week at the cur-
rent view. 
4 Evaluation
To evaluate any bio-surveillance system is very 
challenging (Morse, 2007). Our system is an inte-
gration of several modules, e.g., classification, 
NER and other algorithms. The evaluation proc-
esses for these modules are briefly described be-
low:
4.1 Topic classification
Evaluation of topic classification is presented in 
Doan et al (2007). The system used the BioCaster 
gold standard corpus which includes 1,000 anno-
tated news stories as training data. The classifica-
tion model is na?ve Bayes with features as raw text, 
NEs, and Roles (Doan et al, 2007). The system 
achieved an accuracy score of 88.10%.
4.2 NER evaluation
The evaluation of the NER system module is re-
ported in Kawazoe et al (2006). We used an anno-
tated corpus of 200 corpus news articles as training 
data. The NER system achieved an F-score of 
76.97% for all NE classes. 
4.3 Disease/location detection
For the preliminary evaluation of disease/location 
detection, we used data from a one-month period
(from October 12 to November 11, 2007). 
In our observations, the system detects about 25-30 
locations a day, an average of 40 infectious dis-
eases and 950 detected pairs of diseases/locations 
per month (A news story can contain multiple loca-
tions and diseases). The main news resources
mostly come from Google News (251 pairs, about 
26.4%), Yahoo News (288 pairs, about 30.3%), 
ProMED-mail (180 pairs, about 18.9%), and the 
remaining 24.3% for others. The running time for 
updating disease/location takes about 5 minutes.
In order to evaluate the performance of dis-
ease/location detection, we define the Precision 
and Recall as follows:
pairsRetrieved#
pairsRetrieved#pairsRelevant #
Precision
??
,
pairsRelevant #
pairsRetrieved#pairsRelevant #
Recall
??
Where #Relevant pairs is the number of dis-
ease/location pairs that human found, and #Re-
trieved pairs is the number of disease/location pairs 
that the system detected.
The Precision can be calculated based on our re-
trieved pairs detected by the system, however the 
Recall is under estimated as it does not measure 
pairs missed by  the system in the topic classifica-
tion stage. 
We evaluate the Precision of disease/location de-
tection on 950 pairs of location/disease. The sys-
tem correctly detected 887 pairs, taking 
887/950=93.4% Precision. 
4.4 Limitations of the system
There are some limitations of the system. The first 
limitation is there are several cases of ambiguity. 
For example, news stories about ?A team at Peking 
University in Beijing studied tissue taken from 2 
955
people killed by H5N1 in China? or ?A meeting on 
foot and mouth disease (FMD) was held in Brus-
sels on 17th October, 2007?. The system incorrectly
detects the location as Beijing in the first story, and 
Brussels in the second one. Another hard case is 
location disambiguation, e.g., news about ?Rabies 
in Isle of Wight? in which in the main body does 
not mention anything about country and sub-
country. There are two locations named ?Isle of 
Wight? in our geo-ontology: one in Virginia, USA 
and one in the UK. In the future, we will look at 
the country-level information of new providers (by 
checking domain names) to solve this problem. For 
example, if a news story mentions the Isle of 
Wight, and the news story originates from the UK,
then it will be taken to refer to the Isle of Wight in 
the UK.
The second limitation is the ability to detect new 
diseases or locations that are not in the ontology. In 
the future work, we will augment newly detected 
diseases as well as improve the geographical on-
tology.
5 Conclusion
We presented the Global Health Monitor - a Web-
based system for detecting and mapping infectious 
diseases from Web. The system collects news from 
news feed providers, analyzes news and plots dis-
ease relevant data onto a Google map. Preliminary
evaluations show that our system works efficiently
with real data.
In the future, we will develop more efficient algo-
rithms for detecting diseases/locations based on 
relation identification. Named relation will be de-
scribed in the BCO event taxonomy (Kawazoe et 
al., 2007). Extra capabilities will be added to the 
system like classifying outbreak of disease by 
countries, detecting new diseases that are not in out 
ontology, and showing timeline of news stories.
Evaluation of the timelineness system against hu-
man curated sources like ProMED-mail will be 
implemented. Working versions for other lan-
guages like Vietnamese, Japanese, and Thai are 
also being considered, using the existing BioCaster 
disease ontology.

Abstract
This paper investigates the roles of named
entities (NE?s) in annotated biomedical text
classification. In the annotation schema of
BioCaster, a text mining system for pub-
lic health protection, important concepts that
reflect information about infectious diseases
were conceptually analyzed with a formal
ontological methodology. Concepts were
classified as Types, while others were iden-
tified as being Roles. Types are specified
as NE classes and Roles are integrated into
NEs as attributes. We focus on the Roles
of NEs by extracting and using them in
different ways as features in the classifier.
Experimental results show that: 1) Roles
for each NE greatly helped improve perfor-
mance of the system, 2) combining informa-
tion about NE classes with their Roles con-
tribute significantly to the improvement of
performance. We discuss in detail the effect
of each Role on the accuracy of text classifi-
cation.
1 Introduction
Today, the Internet is a powerful tool for discov-
ering novel information via news feed providers.
This is becoming increasingly important for the
public health domain because it can help to de-
tect emerging and re-emerging diseases. In infec-
tious disease surveillance systems such as the Global
Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) sys-
tem (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004) and
ProMed-Mail (International Society for Infectious
Diseases, 2001), the detection and tracking of out-
breaks using the Internet has been proven to be a
key source of information for public health work-
ers, clinicians, and researchers interested in com-
municable diseases. The basis for such systems is
the monitoring of a large number of news articles
simultaneously. The classification of news articles
into disease-related or none disease-related classes
is the first stage in any automated approach to this
task. In practice though there are a large number of
news articles whose main subject is related to dis-
eases but which should not necessarily be notified
to users together with a relatively small number of
high priority articles that experts should be actively
alerted to. Alerting criteria broadly include news re-
lated to newly emerging diseases, the spread of dis-
eases across international borders, the deliberate re-
lease of a human or engineered pathogen, etc. The
use of only raw text in the classification process in-
evitably fails to resolve many subtle ambiguities, for
example semantic class ambiguities in polysemous
words like ?virus?, ?fever?, ?outbreak?, and ?con-
trol? which all exhibit a variety of senses depending
on context. These different senses appear with rela-
tively high frequency in the news especially in head-
lines. A further challenge is that diseases can be de-
noted by many variant forms. Therefore we consider
that the use of advanced natural language process-
ing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition
(NER) and anaphora resolution are needed in order
to achieve high classification accuracy.
Text classification is defined as the task of as-
signing documents into one or more predefined cat-
17
egories. As shown by (Cohen and Hersh, 2005),
an accurate text classification system can be espe-
cially valuable to database curators. A document in
the biomedical domain can be annotated using NER
techniques with enriched semantic information in
the form of NEs such as the disease, pathogen, loca-
tion, and time. NER and term identification in gen-
eral have been recognized as an important research
topic both in the NLP and biomedical communities
(Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004). However, an in-
vestigation into the contribution of NEs on the per-
formance of annotated biomedical text classification
has remained an open question until now. There are
two main reasons for this: Firstly there are a small
number of open annotation schema for biomedical
text, and secondly there is no benchmark annotated
data for testing.
The BioCaster project (Collier, 2006) is working
towards the detection and tracking of disease out-
breaks from Internet news articles. Although there
are several schema for biomedical text (Wilbur et al,
2006), little work has been done on developing one
specifically for public health related text. BioCaster
therefore provides an annotation schema that can fill
this gap. Our schema, which is based on discussions
with biologists, computational linguists and public
health experts, helps identify entities related to in-
fectious diseases which are then used to build up a
detailed picture of events in later stages of text min-
ing. One significant aspect of the schema is that it
is based on conceptual analysis with a formal on-
tological methodology. As discussed in (Kawazoe
et al, 2006), by applying meta-properties (Guarino
and Welty, 2000a; Guarino and Welty, 2000b), our
?markable? concepts are classified into ?Type? and
?Role?. Information about Role concepts is inte-
grated into the schema as attributes on NEs. This
work takes the investigation one step forward by
showing empirical evidence for the usefulness of
Role concepts in a practical application.
In this paper, we focus on the task of text classifi-
cation, proceeding under the simplifying assumption
that given enough annotated training data for NEs
and their Roles both can be automatically tagged
with high accuracy. In recent years there have been
many studies on text classification using general
methods (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999)
semi-structured texts (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004),
and XML classification (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2003).
Other research has investigated the contribution of
semantic information in the form of synonyms, syn-
tax, etc. in text representation (Bloehdorn and
Hotho, 2004; Hotho et al, 2003; Fru?rnkranz et al,
1998). Feature selection (Scott and Matwin, 1999)
has also been studied. The contribution of this paper
is to provide an analysis and evaluation on the Roles
of NEs in annotated text classification.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in
Section 2, we outline the BioCaster schema for the
annotation of terms in biomedical text; Section 3
presents a description of the BioCaster gold standard
corpus; Section 4 provides details of the method
and experimental results of classification on the gold
standard corpus. Finally we draw some conclusions
in Section 5.
2 BioCaster Schema for Annotation of
Terms in Biomedical Text
The BioCaster annotation schema is a component of
the BioCaster text mining project. We have iden-
tified several important concepts that reflect infor-
mation about infectious diseases, and created guide-
lines for annotating them as target entity classes
in texts. Based on the conceptual analysis using
meta-properties (rigidity, identity, and dependency)
developed by Guarino and Welty (2000a; 2000b),
categories of important concepts were classified as
Types, i.e., properties which are rigid1 and supply
identity conditions, while others were identified as
being Roles, properties which are anti-rigid2 and
dependent. The 18 categories of Type concepts
are specified as NE classes which we denote here
in upper case. These include PERSON, LOCA-
TION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, DISEASE, CON-
DITION (status of patient such as ?hospitalized?
or ?in stable condition?), OUTBREAK (event of
group infection), VIRUS, ANATOMY (body part),
PRODUCT (biological product such as ?vaccine?),
NONHUMAN (animals), DNA, RNA, PROTEIN,
CONTROL (control measures to contain the dis-
ease), BACTERIA, CHEMICAL and SYMPTOM.
The three Role concepts we explore are case (dis-
1A property is rigid if every instance of that property neces-
sarily has the property, i.e. in every possible world.
2A property is anti-rigid if no instance of that property nec-
essarily has the property.
18
eased person), transmission (source of infection)
and therapeutic (therapeutic agent). These are inte-
grated into the annotation schema as XML attributes
which are associated with some XML elements de-
noting Type concepts. PERSON takes a case at-
tribute, NONHUMAN and ANATOMY take trans-
mission, PRODUCT takes transmission and thera-
peutic and CHEMICAL takes therapeutic. For PER-
SON we added another attribute number (number
of people). Each attribute has only one value, the
value of number is one or many, and the value of
case, transmission, therapeutic is true or false. This
is summarized in Table 1. In the rest of this paper,
we call case, transmission, and therapeutic ?Role at-
tributes? (or ?Role? for short) and number a ?Qual-
ity attributes? (or ?Quality? for short).
A NE in a biomedical text is annotated following
the BioCaster annotation schema in XML format as
follows,
<NAME cl="Named Entity"
attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"
... </NAME>,
where "Named Entity" is one of the names for the
18 BioCaster NEs and attribute1, attribute2,
... are the names of the NE?s Role/Quality at-
tributes, "value1", "value2", ... are values cor-
responding to Role/Quality attributes. Further de-
tails of the annotation guidelines are discussed in
(Kawazoe et al, 2006).
3 BioCaster Gold Standard Data Corpus
The BioCaster gold standard corpus was collected
from Internet news and manually annotated by two
doctoral students. The annotation of a news article
proceeded as follows. Firstly, NEs are annotated fol-
lowing the BioCaster schema and guidelines. Sec-
ondly, each annotated article is manually assigned
into one of four relevancy categories: alert, publish,
check, and reject. The assignment is based on guide-
lines that we made following discussions with epi-
demiologists and a survey of World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) reports (World Health Organization,
2004). These categories are currently being used op-
erationally by the GPHIN system which is used by
the WHO and other public health agencies. Where
there were major differences of opinion in NE anno-
tation or relevancy assignment between the two an-
notators, we consulted a public health expert in order
to decide the most appropriate assignment. Finally
we had a total of 500 articles that were fully anno-
tated. While this is small compared to other data
sets in text classification, we consider that it is large
enough to obtain a preliminary indication about the
usefulness of Role attributes.
The following is an example of an annotated arti-
cle in the BioCaster gold standard corpus.

We grouped the 500 articles into 2 categories: re-

simply to articles with label reject while the relevant
category includes articles with labels alert, pub-

as pathogen infectivity and previous occurrence his-

the end user. Finally we had a total of 269 news
articles belong to the reject category and 231 news
articles belong to the relevant category. The statis-
tical information about NEs is shown in Table 2. In
the table, ?+? stands for the frequency of NEs in the
relevant category and ?-? stands for the frequency of
NEs in the reject category.
4 Experiments
4.1 Method
We used the BioCaster gold standard corpus to in-
vestigate the effect of NE classes and their Role at-
tributes on performance of classification. In order
to avoid unnecessary data, we removed the first line
containing DOC tag of all article in the corpus. The
validation is as follows. We randomly divided the
data set into 10 parts. Each of the first 9 parts has 23
articles belonging to the relevant category and 27 ar-
ticles belonging to the reject category; the 10th part
has 24 articles belonging to the relevant and 26 arti-
cles belonging to the reject categories. Then, we im-
plemented 10-fold cross validation: 9 parts for train-
ing and 1 part for testing sets. For the training set we
extracted NEs classes and their Roles as features to
build a classifier. The remaining part was used for
testing.
The classifier we use in this paper is the standard
Na?ive Bayes classifier (Mitchell, 1997). In the pre-
processing we did not use a stop list and no word
stemming. The experiments were implemented in
Linux OS, using the Bow toolkit (McCallum, 1996).
The details of extracting NEs and their Roles
from annotated texts are the followings. For the
sake of convenience, we divided features into 3
groups: Features for each NE, features for NEs with
Role/Quality, and features for combined NEs with
Role/Quality.
1. Features for each NE: Each NE is extracted and
used with raw text as features. We denoted NE1
as features extracted from named entity NE1.
For example, DISEASE1 means features are
raw text and DISEASE class, VIRUS1 means
features are raw text and VIRUS class. An ex-
ample of features for PERSON1 is shown in
Table 3.
2. Features for NEs with Role/Quality: We inves-
tigated the effect of NEs with Roles/Qualities,
i.e., case, number, therapeutic, and transmis-
sion. Features are chosen as follows.
- PERSON+case+number: Raw text and
PERSON class with both Role case and
Quality number are used as features.
- PERSON+case: Raw text and PERSON
class with Role case are used as features.
- PERSON+number: Raw text and PER-
SON class and Quality number are used
as features.
- NONHUMAN+trans: Raw text and
NONHUMAN class and Role transmis-
sion are used as features.
- ANATOMY+trans: Raw text and
ANATOMY class and Role transmission
are used as features.

3. Features for combined NEs with Roles. We
investigate features for disease-related NEs
which include DISEASE, VIRUS, BACTE-
RIA, SYMPTOM, CONDITION, CONTROL,
DNA, PROTEIN, RNA, OUTBREAK, PROD-
UCT, ANATOMY, NONHUMAN, CHEMI-
CAL and features for all NEs with their Roles,
i.e., therapeutic and transmission. We investi-
gated 5 different features as follows:
- Text only: Only raw text is used as fea-
tures.
- Text+DiseaseNEs: Raw text and all 14
NEs disease-related classes are used as
features.
- Text+DiseaseNEs+Roles: Raw text and
all 14 NEs disease-related classes with
Roles are used as features. We note that
there are two Roles therapeutic and trans-
mission in this case.
- Text+AllNEs: Raw text and all NE classes
are used as features.
- Text+AllNEs+Roles: Raw text and all NE
classes with Roles are used as features. In
this case we have all 3 Roles case, thera-
peutic and transmission.

4.2 Results and Discussions
The details of experimental results are shown in the
following sections. We use two performance mea-
sures, standard Precision/Recall and accuracy. They
are calculated based on the two-way contingency ta-
ble in Table 4. In the table, a counts the assigned
and correct cases, b counts the assigned and incor-
rect cases, c counts the not assigned but incorrect
cases, and d counts the not assigned and correct
cases (Yang, 1999). Then,
Precision = aa + b , and Recall =
a
a + c .
Accuracy is defined as accuracy=(a + d)/(a + b +
c + d).
4.2.1 Effectiveness of Each NE Class
In order to investigate the effect of NEs on per-
formance, we consider the baseline as the method
using text only. In experiment the baseline achieved
a performance of 74.40% accuracy and 64.35% Pre-
cision, 100% Recall. We can see that Recall always
achieves 100% in all cases. This may be due to the
small size of data. However it is interesting that we
can observe the change of Precision measure - an
important measure in our case. Hereafter we discuss
accuracy and Precision only.
The effectiveness of each NE class is shown in Ta-
ble 5. The results show that each NE does not have
the same effect. Compared to the baseline, nearly
half the total NEs (7/18) help improve performance
while the others do not have a significant affect.
Looking at the distribution of NE frequency in Ta-
ble 2, it seems that the higher the frequency of the
NE class, the better the performance it provides. For
example, PERSON achieved the best of all (76.80%
accuracy, 66.57% Precision compared to 74.40% ac-
curacy and 64.35% Precision when using raw text).
However this trend is not always followed, for ex-
ample, the TIME class tends to reduce performance
when compared to raw text. This is natural as there
is no obvious correlation between time and rele-
vancy. From the result tables we can conclude that
the effectiveness of each NE on the performance of
classification in our corpus is decreased in the fol-
lowing order.
PERSON > LOCATION > ORGANIZATION >
DISEASE > CONDITION = VIRUS = OUT-
BREAK > NONHUMAN = ANATOMY = SYMP-
TOM = CONTROL = BACTERIA = PRODUCT =
PROTEIN > CHEMICAL = DNA = RNA > TIME
In particular, 7 NEs, i.e., PERSON, LO-
CATION, ORGANIZATION, DISEASE, CONDI-
TION, VIRUS, OUTBREAK improve performance,
while TIME significantly reduces it. Two NEs DNA
and RNA that have low frequency weakly reduce
performance.
4.2.2 Effectiveness of Roles on Classification
In this Section we investigate the effect of each
Role on performance. The experimental results are
shown in Table 6. We can easily observe that Roles
in NEs improved both the accuracy and Precision
significantly.
We first consider the Role case. This Role is as-
sociated to PERSON which has highest frequency
in the corpus. Role case helped improve the ac-
curacy from 76.8% to 80.60%, and Precision from
66.57% to 74.43% for PERSON. This is significant
when we compare to the baseline with 74.4% ac-
curacy and 64.35% Precision. We note that PER-
SON has another attribute, the Quality number. Role
case helps PERSON with Quality number improve
the accuracy from 78.00% to 81.80% and Precision
from 67.74% to 71.74%. Moreover, we can obvi-
ously draw the relative comparison about effective-
ness between Role case and Quality number from
these results, it yields that case > number.
We proceed to investigate the effect of Roles ther-
apeutic and transmission. Obviously we see that
their effects on performance are positive. Specifi-
cally, transmission help NONHUMAN improve the
accuracy from 74.40% to 74.60%, therapeutic helps
CHEMICAL improve the accuracy from 74.20% to
74.40%. They both have not effects on some mi-
nor NE classes like ANATOMY and PRODUCT. If
we had more training data with more of these mi-
nor NE classes we hope to see a positive effect from

Roles on them. Interestingly, while NEs associated
to Roles do not improve the accuracy like NONHU-
MAN and CHEMICAL, their Roles helped improve
the accuracy. Based on the improvements of trans-
mission and therapeutic in Table 6, we can draw
their effectiveness are the same on their NEs, that
is therapeutic = transmission.
When we compare the effect of all Roles on per-
formance, we can see that the improvements of Role
case and also Quality number are much higher than
the improvements of Roles therapeutic and trans-
mission. We think this is because the frequency of
PERSON (NE associated to Role case and Quality
number) is higher than the frequency of NEs which

4.2.3 Effectiveness of Combined NEs with
Roles
We continue to investigate the effectiveness of
Roles for combined NEs. The experimental re-
sults are given in Table 7. We note that there are
two Roles therapeutic and transmission in disease-
related NE classes, and all 3 Roles case, therapeutic
and transmission in all NE classes.
We can easily see that Roles improved perfor-
mance of text classification significantly. In de-
tails, for disease-related NE classes, Roles thera-
peutic and transmission helped to improve the ac-
curacy from 74.40% to 76.20%, and Precision from
64.35% to 66.% compared to the baseline. For all
NE classes, all 3 Roles case, therapeutic, and trans-
mission help to improve the accuracy from 74.40%
to 84.40% and Precision from 64.35% to 74.76%.
We conclude that all 3 Roles achieved the best re-
sults in performance.

5 Conclusion
This paper has focused on the contribution of Roles
in biomedical annotated text classification. The ex-
perimental results indicated that:
1. Roles of each NE greatly help improve perfor-
mance of the system.
2. The effect of Role/Quality attributes on classi-
fication was decreased in the order as follows:
case > number > therapeutic = transmission.
3. Combined NE classes with Roles contribute
significantly to the improvement of perfor-
mance.

1 Introduction
Identifying serious infectious disease outbreaks in
their early stages is an important task, both for na-
tional governments and international organizations
like the World Health Organization. Text mining
and information extraction systems can provide an
important, low cost and timely early warning sys-
tem in these circumstances by identifying the first
signs of an outbreak automatically from online tex-
tual news. One interesting characteristic of disease
outbreak reports ? which to the best of our knowl-
edge has not been studied before ? is their use of
speculative language (hedging) to describe uncertain
situations. This paper describes two uses of hedging
to enhance the BioCaster disease outbreak report
text mining system.
Following a brief description of the BioCaster
system and corpus (section 2), we discuss in section
3 previous uses of hedging in NLP and the meth-
ods used to identify hedges in the current work. In
section 4 we describe some initial classification ex-
periments using hedge features. Section 5 describes
a ?speculative? method of tagging disease outbreak
reports with a metric designed to aid users of the
BioCaster system in identifying articles of inter-
est.
2 BioCaster System & Corpus
The BioCaster system scans online news reports
for stories concerning infectious disease outbreaks
(e.g. H5N1, Ebola) and makes its results available to
registered users as email alerts (Collier et al, 2008).
In addition to this email service, data that has been
filtered through a topic classifier but which is still
uninterpreted is used to populate a Google Map ap-
plication called the Global Health Monitor.1
The BioCaster corpus consists of 1000 news
articles downloaded from the WWW and then man-
ually categorized and annotated with Named Entities
by two PhD students. Articles were collected from
various news sources (e.g. BBC, New York Times
and ProMED-Mail2). Each document is classified
as either relevant (350) or reject (650).3
The corpus is designed to include difficult border-
line cases where more advanced understanding of
the context is required. For example, an article may
be about, say, polio, but not centrally concerned with
specific outbreaks of that disease. Instead, the arti-
cle could report a vaccination campaign or research
breakthrough.
3 Hedges
According to Hyland (1998), in an extensive study
of speculative language in science writing, hedges
?are the means by which writers can present a propo-
sition as an opinion rather than a fact.? More re-
cently, Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) have presented
a method for automatically identifying hedges in the
biomedical domain. In the current work, we used a
science orientated hedge lexicon derived from Mer-
cer et al (2004). The lexicon consisted of 72 verbs
(including appear, appears, appeared, appearing,
indicate, indicates, indicated, indicating, and so on)
and 32 non-verbs (including, about, quite, poten-

that the frequency of hedge words differs in the two
categories of the BioCaster corpus (relevant and
reject) at a highly significant level using the ?2 test
(P < 0.01). Table 1 shows the 16 most discriminat-
ing hedge words in the BioCaster corpus (identi-
fied using the ?2 feature selection method.)
4 Classification Experiment
The current BioCaster system uses n-gram based
text classification to identify disease outbreak re-
ports, and reject other online news. We used hedg-
ing features to augment this classifier, and evaluated
the results using a subset of the BioCaster cor-
pus. One binary hedging feature was used. The fea-
ture was ?true? if and only if one of the 105 hedge
lexemes identified by Mercer et al (2004) occurred
in the input document within 5 words of a disease
named entity. Results are shown in Table 2, where it
can be seen that the addition of a single binary hedge
feature to the unigram feature set increases accuracy
by 0.8%. The performance does not however reach
the level achieved by the ?2 9000 n-gram feature set
described in Conway et al (2008).
5 Towards a ?Speculative? Metric
Users of the BioCaster system would benefit
from an indicator of how ?speculative? each news
article is, as breaking news regarding disease out-
breaks is characterized by uncertainty, which is en-
coded using hedging. We use the Mercer list of 105
hedging words as described above, in conjunction
with statistics derived from a 10,000 document sec-
Accept (%) Reject (%)
High 64.2 48.3
Medium 29.5 36.7
Low 6.3 15.0
Table 3: Proportion of Articles in Each Category
tion of the Reuters corpus to provide a ?speculative?
metric.4 We calculated total frequencies for all 105
hedge words in each of the 10,000 Reuters docu-
ments ? that is, the total number of hedge words
per document ? then ranked these frequencies (af-
ter normalizing the frequencies to take account of
document length). The bottom third of documents
had hedge percentages in the range 0% - 0.2544%
(LOW). The middle third had hedge percentages in
the range 0.2545% - 1.0574 (MEDIUM). The range
for the top third was 1.0575% - 100% (HIGH). Doc-
uments inputted to the BioCaster system auto-
matically have their proportion of hedge words cal-
culated and are assigned a value according to their
position on the scale (LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH). Ta-
ble 3 shows that a majority of the documents in the
accept segment of the BioCaster corpus can be
tagged as highly speculative using this method.

Abstract
Text mining for global health surveillance
is an emerging technology that is gaining
increased attention from public health or-
ganisations and governments. The lack
of multilingual resources such as Word-
Nets specifically targeted at this task have
so far been a major bottleneck. This pa-
per reports on a major upgrade to the
BioCaster Web monitoring system and
its freely available multilingual ontology;
improving its original design and extend-
ing its coverage of diseases from 70 to 336
in 12 languages.
1 Introduction
The number of countries who can sustain teams
of experts for global monitoring of human/animal
health is limited by scarce national budgets.
Whilst some countries have advanced sensor net-
works, the world remains at risk from the health
impacts of infectious diseases and environmen-
tal accidents. As seen by the recent A(H5N1),
A(H1N1) and SARS outbreaks, a problem in one
part of the world can be rapidly exported, leading
to global hardship.
The World Health Organization (WHO) esti-
mates that in the future, between 2 to 7.4 mil-
lion people could be at risk worldwide from a
highly contageous avian flu virus that spreads
rapidly through the international air travel net-
work (WHO, 2005). Pandemics of novel
pathogens have the capacity to overwhelm health-
care systems, leading to widespread morbidity,
mortality and socio-economic disruption (Cox
et al, 2003). Furthermore, outbreaks of live-
stock diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease or
equine influenza can have a devastating impact on
industry, commerce and human health (Blake et
al., 2003). The challenge is to enhance vigilance
and control the emergence of outbreaks. Whilst
human analysis remains essential to spot complex
relationships, automated analysis has a key role
to play in filtering the vast volume of data in real
time and highlighting unusual trends using reli-
able predictor indicators.
BioCaster (http://born.nii.ac.jp) (Collier et al,
2008) is a Web 2.0 monitoring station for the early
detection of infectious disease events. The sys-
tem exploits a high-throughput semantic process-
ing pipeline, converting unstructured news texts
to structured records, alerting events based on
time-series analysis and then sharing this informa-
tion with users via geolocating maps (Fig. 1(a)),
graphs (Fig. 1(b)) and alerts. Underlying the sys-
tem is a publicly available multilingual applica-
tion ontology. Launched in 2006 (Collier et al,
2006) the BioCaster Ontology (BCO) has been
downloaded by over 70 academic and industrial
groups worldwide. This paper reports on a ma-
jor upgrade to the system and the ontology - ex-
panding the number of languages from 6 to 12,
redefining key relations and extending coverage in
the number of diseases from 70 to 336, including
many veterinary diseases.

2 Background
As the world becomes more interconnected and
urbanized and animal production becomes in-
creasingly intensive, the speed with which epi-
demics spread becomes faster, adding to pressure
on biomedical experts and governments to make
quick decisions. Traditional validation methods
such as field investigations or laboratory analysis
are the mainstay of public health but can require
days or weeks to issue reports. The World Wide
Web with its economical and real time delivery of
information represents a new modality in health
surveillance (Wagner and Johnson, 2006) and has
been shown to be an effective source by the World
Health Organization (WHO) when Public Health
Canada?s GPHIN system detected the SARS out-
break in southern China from news reports dur-
ing November 2002. The recent A(H1N1) ?swine
flu? pandemic highlighted the trend towards agen-
cies using unvalidated sources. The technologi-
cal basis for such systems can be found in sta-
tistical classification approaches and light weight
ontological reasoning. For example, Google Flu
Trends (Ginsberg et al, 2009) is a system that de-
pends almost entirely on automatic statistical clas-
sification of user queries; MedISys-PULS (Yan-
garber et al, 2008), HealthMap (Freifeld et al,
2008) and BioCaster use a mixture of statisti-
cal and ontological classification; and GPHIN
(Mawudeku and Blench, 2006) and Argus (Wil-
son, 2007) rely on a mixture of ontological classi-
fication and manual analysis.
Compared to other similar systems BioCaster
is characterized by its richly featured and pub-
licly downloadable ontology and emphasizes crit-
ical evaluation of its text mining modules. Em-
pirical results have included: topic classification,
named entity recognition, formal concept anal-
ysis and event recognition. In the absence of
a community gold standard, task performance
was assessed on the best available ?silver? stan-
dard - the ProMED-mail network (Madoff and
Woodall, 2005), achieving F-score of 0.63 on 14
disease-country pairs over a 365-day period (Col-
lier, 2010).
Despite initial skepticism within the public
health community, health surveillance systems
based on NLP-supported human analysis of me-
dia reports are becoming firmly established in
Europe, North America and Japan as sources of
health information available to governments and
the public (Hartley et al, 2010). Whilst there is no
substitute for trained human analysts, automated
filtering has helped experts save time by allow-
ing them to sift quickly through massive volumes
of media data. It has also enabled them to sup-
plement traditional sources with a broader base of
information.
In comparison with other areas of biomedical
NLP such as the clinical and genetics? domains, a
relative lack of building block resources may have
hindered the wider participation of NLP groups
in public health applications. It is hoped that the
provision of common resources like the BCO can
help encourage further development and bench-
marking.
3 Method
BioCaster performs analysis of over 9000 news ar-
ticles per day using the NPACI Rocks cluster mid-
dleware (http://www.rockcsclusters.org) on a plat-
form of 48 3.0GHz Xeon cores. Data is ingested
24/7 into a semantic processing pipeline in a short
1 hour cycle from over 1700 public domain RSS
feeds such as Google news, the European Media
Monitor and ProMED-mail. Since 2009, news has
also being gathered under contract from a com-
mercial news aggregation company, providing ac-
cess to over 80,000 sources across the world?s lan-
guages.
The new 2010 version of BioCaster uses ma-
chine translation into English (eleven languages)
to source news stories related to currently oc-
curring infectious and environmental disease out-
breaks in humans, animals and plants.
Access to the site is freely available but lo-
gin registration applies to some functions such as
email alerts. Processing is totally automatic, but
we have the potential within the login system to
enable human moderated alerts which broadcast
to Twitter and RSS.
Below we describe in detail two key aspects of
the system that have been significantly upgraded:
the BCO and the event detection system.
217
3.1 Ontology
3.1.1 Aim
The BioCaster Ontology aims:
? To describe the terms and relations necessary
to detect and risk assess public health events
in the grey literature;
? To bridge the gap between (multilingual)
grey literature and existing standards in
biomedicine;
? To mediate integration of content across lan-
guages;
? To be freely available.
The central knowledge source for BioCaster
is the multilingual ontology containing domain
terms such as diseases, agents, symptoms, syn-
dromes and species as well as domain sensitive
relations such as a disease causing symptoms or
an agent affecting particular host species. This al-
lows the text mining system to have a basic un-
derstanding of the key concepts and relationships
within the domain to fill in gaps not mentioned
explicitly in the news reports. To the best of our
knowledge the BCO is unique as an application
ontology, providing freely available multilingual
support to system developers interested in out-
break surveillance in the language of the open me-
dia.
The BCO however has little to say outside of
its application domain, e.g. in disease-gene in-
teraction or for supporting automatic diagnosis.
As discussed in Grey Cowell and Smith (2010),
there are many other resources available that have
the potential to support applications for infec-
tious disease analysis including controlled vocab-
ularies and ontologies such as the the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) (Lindberg et
al., 1993), International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-10) (WHO, 2004), SNOMED CT (Stearns
et al, 2001), Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
(Lipscomb, 2000) and the Infectious Disease On-
tology (IDO) (Grey Cowell and Smith, 2010). In
(Collier et al, 2006) we discussed how BCO com-
pared to such ontologies so we will focus from
now on the implication of the extensions.
3.1.2 Scope
The new version of the BCO now covers 12 lan-
guages including all the United Nation?s official
languages: Arabic (968 terms), English (4113),
French (1281), Indonesian (1081), Japanese
(2077), Korean (1176), Malaysian (1001), Rus-
sian (1187), Spanish (1171), Thai (1485), Viet-
namese (1297) and Chinese (1142). The multi-
lingual ontology can be used as a direct knowl-
edge source in language-specific text mining mod-
ules, as an indexing resource for searching across
concepts in various languages and as a dictionary
for future translation modules. Currently news in
all 12 languages is available via the Web portal
but news in additional languages such as German,
Italian and Dutch are being added using machine
translation.
3.1.3 Design
Like EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), on which
it is loosely based, the BCO adopts a thesaurus-
like structure with synonym sets linking to-
gether terms across languages with similar mean-
ing. Synonym sets are referred to using root
terms. Root terms themselves are fully defined in-
stances that provide bridges to external classifica-
tion schemes and nomenclatures such as ICD10,
MeSH, SNOMED CT and Wikipedia. The central
backbone taxonomy is deliberately shallow and
taken from the ISO?s Suggested Upper Merged
Ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001). To maintain
consistency and computability we kept a single
inheritance structure throughout. 18 core domain
concepts corresponding to named entities in the
text mining system such as DISEASE and SYMP-
TOM were the results of analysis using a formal
theory (Guarino and Welty, 2000).
We have endeavoured to construct definitions
for root terms along Aristotelean principles by
specifying the difference to the parent. For ex-
ample in the case of Eastern encephalitis virus:
Eastern equine encephalitis virus is a
species of virus that belongs to the
genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviri-
dae (order unassigned) of the group
IV ((+)ssRNA) that possesses a positive
single stranded RNA genome. It is the
218
etiological agent of the eastern equine
encephalitis.
We are conscious though that terms used in
the definitions still require more rigorous control
to be considered useful for machine reasoning.
To aid both human and machine analysis root
terms are linked by a rich relational structure
reflecting domain sensitive relations such as
causes(virus,disease), has symptom(disease,
symptom), has associated syndrome(disease,
syndrome), has reservoir(virus, organism).
In such a large undertaking, the order of work
was critical. We proceeded by collecting a list of
notifiable diseases from national health agencies
and then grouped the diseases according to per-
ceived relevance to the International Health Reg-
ulations 2005 (Lawrence and Gostin, 2004). In
this way we covered approximately 200 diseases,
and then explored freely available resources and
the biomedical literature to find academic and lay-
man?s terminology to describe their agents, af-
fected hosts, vector species, symptoms, etc. We
then expanded the coverage to less well known
human diseases, zoonotic diseases, animal dis-
eases and diseases caused by toxic substances
such as sarin, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and
ethylene. At regular stages we checked and val-
idated terms against those appearing in the news
media.
As we expanded the number of conditions to in-
clude veterinary diseases we found a major struc-
tural reorganization was needed to support animal
symptoms. For example, a high temperature in
humans would not be the same as one in bovids.
This prompted us in the new version to group dis-
eases and symptoms around major animal familes
and related groups, e.g. high temperature (human)
and high temperature (bovine).
A second issue that we encountered was the
need to restructure the hierarchy under Organi-
cObject which was divided between MicroOrgan-
ism and Animal. The structure of the previous
version meant that the former were doing dou-
ble duty as infecting agents and the later were af-
fected hosts. The MicroOrganism class contained
bacterium, helminth, protozoan, fungus and virus,
which then became the domain in a relation ?x
causes y?. Expansion forced us to accomodate the
fact that some animals such as worms and mites
(e.g. scabies) also infect humans as well as ani-
mals. The result was a restructuring of the organic
classes using the Linnean taxonomy as a guide-
line, although this is probably not free from errors
(e.g. virus is typically not considered to be an or-
ganism).
3.2 Event alerting system
Figure 1(c) shows a schematic of the modular de-
sign used by the BioCaster text mining system.
Following on from machine translation and topic
classification is named entity recognition and tem-
plate recognition which we describe in more detail
below. The final structured event frames include
slot values normalized to ontology root terms for
disease, pathogen (virus or bacterium), country
and province. Additionally we also identify 15 as-
pects of public health events critical to risk assess-
ment such as: spread across international borders,
hospital worker infection, accidental or deliberate
release, food contamination and vaccine contami-
nation.
Latitude and longitude of events down to the
province level are found in two ways: using the
Google API up to a limit of 15000 lookups per
day, and then using lookup on the BCO taxonomy
of 5000 country and province names derived from
open sources such as Wikipedia.
Each hour events are automatically alerted to
a Web portal page by comparing daily aggre-
gated event counts against historical norms (Col-
lier, 2010). Login users can also sign up to receive
emails on specific topics. A topic would normally
specify a disease or syndrome, a country or region
and a specific risk condition.
In order to extract knowledge from docu-
ments, BioCaster maintains a collection of rule
patterns in a regular expression language that
converts surface expressions into structured in-
formation. For example the surface phrase
?man exposes airline passengers to measles?
would be converted into the three templates
?species(human); disease(measles); interna-
tional travel(true)?. Writing patterns to produce
such templates can be very time consuming and
so the BioCaster project has developed its own
219
D3: :- name(disease){ list(@undiagnosed) words(,1) list(@disease) }
S2: :- name(symptom) { list(@severity) list(@symptom)}
CF1: contaminated food(?true?) :- ?caused? ?by? list(@contaminate verbs past)
list(@injested material)
SP4: species(?animal?) :- name(animal,A) words(,3) list(@cull verbs past)
Table 1: Examples of SRL rules for named entity and template recognition. Template rules contain
a label, a head and a body, where the head specifies the template pattern to be output if the body
expression matches. The body can contain word lists, literals, and wild cards. Various conditions can
be placed on each of these such as orthographic matching.
light weight rule language - called the Simple
Rule Language (SRL) and a pattern building inter-
face for maintaining the rule base (McCrae et al,
2009). Both are freely available to the research
community under an open source license. Cur-
rently BioCaster uses approximately 130 rules for
entity recognition, 1000 word lists and 3200 tem-
plate rules (of which half are for location recogni-
tion) to identify events of interest in English. Us-
ing SRL allows us to quickly adapt the system to
newly emerging terminology such as the 11+ des-
ignations given to A(H1N1) during the first stages
of the 2009 pandemic.
The SRL rulebook for BioCaster can recognize
a range of entities related to the task of disease
surveillance such as bacteria, chemicals, diseases,
countries, provinces, cities and major airports.
Many of these classes are recognized using terms
imported from the BCO. The rule book also con-
tains specialised thesauri to recognize subclasses
of entities such as locations of habitation, eater-
ies and medical service centres. Verb lists are
maintained for lexical classes such as detection,
mutation, investigation, causation, contamination,
culling, blaming, and spreading.
Some examples of SRL rules for named entity
recognition are shown in Table 1 and described
below:
Rule D3 in the rulebook tags phrases like ?mys-
tery illness? or ?unknown killer bug? by matching
on strings contained within two wordlists, @un-
diagnosed and @disease, separated by up to one
word.
Rule S2 allows severity indicators such as ?se-
vere? or ?acute? to modify a list of known symp-
toms in order to identify symptom entities.
Rule CF1 is an example of a template rule. If
the body of the rule matches by picking out ex-
pressions such as ?was caused by tainted juice?,
this triggers the head to output an alert for con-
taminated food.
Rule SP4 identifies the victim species as ?ani-
mal? in contexts like ?250 geese were destroyed?.
The rulebook also supports more complex in-
ferences such as the home country of national
public health organizations.
Since BioCaster does not employ systematic
manual checking of its reports, it uses a number of
heuristic filters to increase specificity (the propor-
tion of correctly identified negatives) for reports
that appear on the public Web portal pages. For
example, reports with no identified disease and
country are rejected. Since these heuristics may
reduce sensitivity they are not applied to news that
appears on the user login portal pages.
4 Results and Discussion
Version 3 of the ontology represents a significant
expansion in the coverage of diseases, symptoms
and pathogens on version 2. Table 2 summarizes
the number of root terms for diseases classified by
animal familes.
The thesaurus like structure of the BCO is com-
patible in many respects to the Simple Knowledge
Organization System (SKOS) (Miles et al, 2005).
In order to extend exchange and re-use we have
produced a SKOS version of the BCO which is
available from the BCO site. We have also con-
verted the BCO terms into 12 SRL rule books (1
for each language) for entity tagging. These too
are freely available from the BCO site.
As the ontology expands we will consider
adopting a more detailed typing of diseases such
as hasInfectingPart to indicate the organ affected
220

or hasProtectionMethod to indicate broad classes
of methods used to prevent or treat a condition.
The typology of diseases could also be extended
in a more fine grained manner to logically group
conditions, e.g. West Nile virus encephalitis,
Powassan encephalitis and the Japanese B en-
cephalitis could be connected through a hasType
relation on encephalitis.
5 Conclusion
Multilingual resources specifically targeted at the
task of global health surveillance have so far been
very rare. We hope that the release of version 3
can be used to support a range of applications such
as text classification, cross language search, ma-
chine translation, query expansion and so on.
The BCO has been constructed to provide core
vocabulary and knowledge support to the Bio-
Caster project but it has also been influential
in the construction of other public health ori-
ented application ontologies such as the Syn-
dromic Surveillance Ontology (Okhamatovskaia
et al, 2009). The BCO is freely available from
http://code.google.com/p/biocaster-ontology/ un-
der a Creative Commons license.

Abstract
Due to the lack of annotated data sets, 
there are few studies on machine learning 
based approaches to extract named enti-
ties (NEs) in clinical text. The 2009 i2b2 
NLP challenge is a task to extract six 
types of medication related NEs, includ-
ing medication names, dosage, mode, 
frequency, duration, and reason from 
hospital discharge summaries. Several 
machine learning based systems have 
been developed and showed good per-
formance in the challenge. Those systems 
often involve two steps: 1) recognition of 
medication related entities; and 2) deter-
mination of the relation between a medi-
cation name and its modifiers (e.g., do-
sage). A few machine learning algo-
rithms including Conditional Random 
Field (CRF) and Maximum Entropy have 
been applied to the Named Entity Recog-
nition (NER) task at the first step. In this 
study, we developed a Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) based method to recog-
nize medication related entities. In addi-
tion, we systematically investigated vari-
ous types of features for NER in clinical 
text. Evaluation on 268 manually anno-
tated discharge summaries from i2b2 
challenge showed that the SVM-based 
NER system achieved the best F-score of 
90.05% (93.20% Precision, 87.12% Re-
call), when semantic features generated 
from a rule-based system were included.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an impor-
tant step in natural language processing (NLP). It 
has many applications in general language do-
main such as identifying person names, locations, 
and organizations. NER is crucial for biomedical 
literature mining as well (Hirschman, Morgan, & 
Yeh, 2002; Krauthammer & Nenadic, 2004) and 
many studies have focused on biomedical entities, 
such as gene/protein names. There are mainly 
two types of approaches to identify biomedical 
entities: rule-based and machine learning based 
approaches. While rule-based approaches use 
existing biomedical knowledge/resources, ma-
chine learning (ML) based approaches rely much 
on annotated training data. The advantage of 
rule-based approaches is that they usually can 
achieve stable performance across different data 
sets due to the verified resources, while machine 
learning approaches often report better results 
when the training data are good enough. In order 
to harness the advantages of both approaches, the 
combination of them, called the hybrid approach, 
has often been used as well. CRF and SVM are 
two common machine learning algorithms that 
have been widely used in biomedical NER 
(Takeuchi & Collier, 2003; Kazama, Makino, 
Ohta, & Tsujii, 2002; Yamamoto, Kudo, 
Konagaya, & Matsumoto, 2003; Torii, Hu, Wu, 
& Liu, 2009; Li, Savova, & Kipper-Schuler, 
2008). Some studies reported better results using 
CRF (Li, Savova, & Kipper-Schuler, 2008),
while others showed that the SVM was better 
(Tsochantaridis, Joachims, & Hofmann, 2005) in 
NER. Keerthi & Sundararajan (Keerthi & Sunda-
rarajan, 2007) conducted some experiments and 
demonstrated that CRF and SVM were quite 
close in performance, when identical feature 
functions were used.
2 Background
There has been large ongoing effort on 
processing clinical text in Electronic Medical 
Records (EMRs). Many clinical NLP systems

have been developed, including MedLEE
(Friedman, Alderson, Austin, Cimino, & John-
son, 1994), SymTex (Haug et al, 1997), Meta-
Map (Aronson, 2001). Most of those systems 
recognize clinical named entities such as diseas-
es, medications, and labs, using rule-based me-
thods such as lexicon lookup, mainly because of 
two reasons: 1) there are very rich knowledge 
bases and vocabularies of clinical entities, such 
as the Unified Medical Language System 
(UMLS) (Lindberg, Humphreys, & McCray, 
1993), which includes over 100 controlled bio-
medical vocabularies, such as RxNorm, 
SNOMED,  and ICD-9-CM; 2) very few anno-
tated data sets of clinical text are available for 
machine learning based approaches.
Medication is one of the most important types 
of information in clinical text. Several studies 
have worked on extracting drug names from clin-
ical notes. Evans et al (Evans, Brownlow, Hersh, 
& Campbell, 1996) showed that drug and dosage 
phrases in discharge summaries could be identi-
fied by the CLARIT system with an accuracy of 
80%. Chhieng et al (Chhieng, Day, Gordon, & 
Hicks, 2007) reported a precision of 83% when 
using a string matching method to identify drug 
names in clinical records. Levin et al (Levin, 
Krol, Doshi, & Reich, 2007) developed an effec-
tive rule-based system to extract drug names 
from anesthesia records and map to RxNorm 
concepts with 92.2% sensitivity and 95.7% spe-
cificity. Sirohi and Peissig (Sirohi & Peissig, 
2005) studied the effect of lexicon sources on 
drug extraction. Recently, Xu et al (Xu et al, 
2010) developed a rule-based system for medica-
tion information extraction, called MedEx, and 
reported F-scores over 90% on extracting drug 
names, dose, route, and frequency from dis-
charge summaries.
Starting 2007, Informatics for Integrating Bi-
ology and the Bedside (i2b2), an NIH-funded 
National Center for Biomedical Computing 
(NCBC) based at Partners Healthcare System in 
Boston, organized a series of shared tasks of
NLP in clinical text. The 2009 i2b2 NLP chal-
lenge was to extract medication names, as well as 
their corresponding signature information includ-
ing dosage, mode, frequency, duration, and rea-
son from de-identified hospital discharge sum-
maries (Uz?ner, Solti, & Cadag, 2009). At the 
beginning of the challenge, a training set of 696 
notes were provided by the organizers. Among 
them, 17 notes were annotated by the i2b2 orga-
nizers, based on an annotation guideline (see Ta-
ble 1 for examples of medication information in 
the guideline), and the rest were un-annotated 
notes. Participating teams would develop their 
systems based on the training set, and they were

allowed to annotate additional notes in the train-
ing set. The test data set included 547clinical 
notes, from which 251 notes were randomly 
picked by the organizers. Those 251 notes were 
then annotated by participating teams, as well as 
the organizers, and they served as the gold stan-
dard for evaluating the performance of systems 
submitted by participating teams. An example of 
original text and annotated text were shown in 
Figure 1.
The results of systems submitted by the partic-
ipating teams were presented at the i2b2 work-
shop and short papers describing each system 
were available at i2b2 web site with protected 
passwords. Among top 10 systems which 
achieved the best performance, there were 6 rule-
based, 2 machine learning based, and 2 hybrid 
systems. The best system, which used a machine 
learning based approach, reached the highest F-
score of 85.7% (Patrick & Li, 2009). The second 
best system, which was a rule-based system us-
ing the existing MedEx tool, reported an F-score 
of 82.1% (Doan, Bastarache L., Klimkowski S., 
Denny J.C., & Xu, 2009). The difference be-
tween those two systems was statistically signifi-
cant. However, this finding was not very surpris-
ing, as the machine learning based system uti-
lized additional 147 annotated notes by the par-
ticipating team, while the rule-based system 
mainly used 17 annotated training data to cus-
tomize the system. 
Interestingly, two machine learning systems in 
the top ten systems achieved very different per-
formance, one (Patrick et al, 2009) achieved an 
F-score of 85.7%, ranked the first; while another 
(Li et al, 2009) achieved an F-score of 76.4%, 
ranked the 10th on the final evaluation. Both sys-
tems used CRF for NER, on the equivalent num-
ber of training data (145 and 147 notes respec-
tively). The large difference in F-score of those 
two systems could be due to: the quality of train-
ing set, and feature sets using for classification. 
More recently, i2b2 organizers also reported a 
Maximum Entropy (ME) based approach for the 
2009 challenge (Halgrim, Xia, Solti, Cadag, & 
Uzuner, 2010). Using the same annotated data set 
as in (Patrick et al, 2009), they reported an F-
score of 84.1%, when combined features such as 
unigram, word bigrams/trigrams, and label of 
previous words were used. These results indi-
cated the importance of feature sets used in ma-
chine learning algorithms in this task. 
For supervised machine learning based sys-
tems in the i2b2 challenge, the task was usually 
divided into two steps: 1) NER of six medication 
related findings; and 2) determination of the rela-
tion between detected medication names and 
other entities. It is obvious that NER is the first 
crucial step and it affects the performance of the 
whole system. However, short papers presented 
at the i2b2 workshop did not show much detailed 
evaluation on NER components in machine 
learning based systems.  The variation in perfor-
mance of different machine learning based sys-
tems also motivated us to further investigate the 
effect of different types of features on recogniz-

ing medication related entities.  
In this study, we developed an SVM-based 
NER system for recognizing medication related 
entities, which is a sub-task of the i2b2 chal-
lenge. We systematically investigated the effects 
of typical local contextual features that have been 
reported in many biomedical NER studies. Our 
studies provided some valuable insights to NER 
tasks of medical entities in clinical text.
3 Methods
A total of 268 annotated discharge summaries 
(17 from training set and 251 from test set) from 
i2b2 challenge were used in this study. This an-
notated corpus contains 9,689 sentences, 326,474 
words, and 27,589 entities. Annotated notes were 
converted into a BIO format and different types 
of feature sets were used in an SVM classifier for 
NER. Performance of the NER system was eva-
luated using precision, recall, and F-score, based 
on 10-fold cross validation.  
3.1 Preprocessing
The annotated corpus was converted into a BIO 
format (see an example in Figure 2).  Specifically, 
it assigned each word into a class as follows: B
means beginning of an entity, I means inside an 
entity, and O means outside of an entity. As we 
have six types of entities, we have six different B 
classes and six different I classes. For example, 
for medication names, we define the B class as
?B-m?, and the I class as ?I-m?.  Therefore, we 
had total 13 possible classes to each word 
(including O class).

tion, do as dose, mo as mode, and f as frequency).
After preprocessing, the NER problem now 
can be considered as a classification problem, 
which is to assigns one of the 13 class labels to 
each word. 
3.2 SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine 
learning method that is widely used in many 
NLP tasks such as chunking, POS, and NER. 
Essentially, it constructs a binary classifier using 
labeled training samples. Given a set of training 
samples, the SVM training phrase tries to find 
the optimal hyperplane, which maximizes the 
distance of training sample nearest to it (called 
support vectors). SVM takes an input as a vector 
and maps it into a feature space using a kernel 
function. 
In this paper we used TinySVM1 along with 
Yamcha2
3.3 Features sets
developed at NAIST (Kudo & Matsu-
moto, 2000; Kudo & Matsumoto, 2001). We 
used a polynomial kernel function with the de-
gree of kernel as 2, context window as +/-2, and 
the strategy for multiple classification as pair-
wise (one-against-one). Pairwise strategy means 
it will build K(K-1)/2 binary classifiers in which 
K is the number of classes (in this case K=13). 
Each binary classifier will determine whether the 
sample should be classified as one of the two 
classes. Each binary classifier has one vote and 
the final output is the class with the maximum 
votes. These parameters were used in many bio-
medical NER tasks such as (Takeuchi & Collier, 
2003; Kazama et al, 2002; Yamamoto et al, 
2003).
In this study, we investigated different types of 
features for the SVM-based NER system for me-
dication related entities, including 1) words; 2) 
Part-of-Speech (POS) tags; 3) morphological 
clues; 4) orthographies of words; 5)  previous 
history features; 6) semantic tags determined by 
MedEx, a rule based medication extraction sys-
tem. Details of those features are described be-
low: 
x Words features: Words only. We referred it 
as a baseline method in this study.
x POS features: Part-of-Speech tags of words. 
To obtain POS information, we used a POS 
tagger in the NLTK package3

http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySVM/
.

http://chasen.org/~taku/software/YamCha/
3 www.nltk.org
262
x Morphologic features: suffix/prefix of up to 
3 characters within a word. 
x Orthographic features: information about if a 
word contains capital letters, digits, special 
characters etc. We used orthographic features 
described in (Collier, Nobata, & Tsujii, 
2000) and modified some as for medication 
information such as ?digit and percent?. We 
had totally 21 labels for orthographic fea-
tures.
x Previous history features: Class assignments 
of preceding words, by the NER system it-
self.
x Semantic tag features: semantic categories of 
words. Typical NER systems use dictionary 
lookup methods to determine semantic cate-
gories of a word (e.g., gene names in a dic-
tionary). In this study, we used MedEx, the 
best rule-based medication extraction system 
in the i2b2 challenge, to assign medication 
specific categories into words.
MedEx was originally developed at Vanderbilt 
University, for extracting medication information 
from clinical text (Xu et al, 2010). MedEx labels 
medication related entities with a pre-defined 
semantic categories, which has overlap with the 
six entities defined in the i2b2 challenge, but not 
exactly same. For example, MedEx breaks the 
phrase ?fluocinonide 0.5% cream? into drug 
name: ?fluocinonide?, strength: ?0.5%?, and
form: ?cream?; while i2b2 labels the whole 
phrase as a medication name. There are a total of 
11 pre-defined semantic categories which are 
listed in (Xu et al, 2010c). When the Vanderbilt 
team applied MedEx to the i2b2 challenge, they 
customized and extended MedEx to label medi-
cation related entities as required by i2b2. Those 
customizations included:
- Customized Rules to combine entities recog-
nized by MedEx into i2b2 entities, such as 
combine drug name: ?fluocinonide?,
strength: ?0.5%?, and form: ?cream? into 
one medication name ?fluocinonide 0.5% 
cream?.
- A new Section Tagger to filter some drug 
names in sections such as ?allergy? and
?labs?.
- A new Spell Checker to check whether a 
word can be a misspelled drug names. 
In a summary, the MedEx system will produce 
two sets of semantic tags: 1) initial tags that are 
identified by the original MedEx system; 2) final 
tags that are identified by the customized MedEx 
system for the i2b2 challenge. The initial tagger 
will be equivalent to some simple dictionary look 
up methods used in many NER systems. The fi-
nal tagger is a more advanced method that inte-
grates other level of information such as sections 
and spellings. The outputs of initial tag include 
11 pre-defined semantic tags in MedEx, and out-
puts of final tags consist of 6 types of NEs as in 
the i2b2 requirements. Therefore, it is interesting 
to us to study effects of both types of tags from 
MedEx in this study. These semantic tags were 
also converted into the BIO format when they 
were used as features.

F-score using the CoNLL evaluation script4
Table 2 shows the precision, recall, and F-
score of the SVM-based NER system for all six 
types of entities, when different combinations of 
feature sets were used. Among them, the best F-
score of 90.05% was achieved, when all feature 
sets were used. A number of interesting findings 
can be concluded from those results. First, the 
contribution of different types of features to the 
system?s performance varies. For example, the 
?previous history feature? and the ?morphology 
feature? improved the performance substantially 
(F-score from 81.76% to 83.83%, and from 
83.81% to 86.06% respectively). These findings 
were consistent with previous reported results on 
protein/gene NER (Kazama et al, 2002; Takeu-
chi and Collier, 2003; Yamamoto et al, 2003). 
However, ?POS? and ?orthographic? features 
contributed very little, not as much as in pro-
tein/gene names recognition tasks.  This could be 
related to the differences between gene/protein 
phrases and medication phrases ? more ortho-
graphic clues are observed in gene/protein 
names. Second, the ?semantic tags? features 
alone, even just using the original tagger in Me-
dEx, improved the performance dramatically 
(from 81.76% to 86.51% or 89.47%). This indi-
. Pre-
cision is the ratio between the number of correct-
ly identified NE chunks by the system and the 
total number of NE chunks found by the system; 
Recall is the ratio between the number of correct-
ly identified NE chunks by the system and the 
total number of NE chunks in the gold standard.
Experiments were run in a Linux machine with 
16GB RAM and 8 cores of Intel Xeon 2.0GHz
processor. The performance of different types of 
feature sets was evaluated using 10-fold cross-
validation.

xt
cates that the knowledge bases in the biomedical 
domain are crucial to biomedical NER. Third, the 
customized final semantic tagger in MedEx had 
much better performance than the original tagger, 
which indicated that advanced semantic tagging 
methods that integrate other levels of linguistic 
information (e.g., sections) were more useful 
than simple dictionary lookup methods.
Table 3 shows the precision, recall, and F-
score for each type of entity, from the MedEx 
alone, and the baseline and the best runs of the 
SVM-based NER system. As we can see, the best 
SVM-based NER system that combines all types 
of features (including inputs from MedEx) was 
much better than the MedEx system alone 
(90.05% vs. 85.86%). This suggested that the 
combination of rule-based systems with machine
learning approaches could yield the most opti-
mized performance in biomedical NER tasks.
Among six types of medication entities, we 
noticed that four types of entities (medication 
names, dosage, mode, and frequency) got very 
high F-scores (over 92%); while two others (du-
ration and reason) had low F-scores (up to 50%). 
This finding was consistent with results from 
i2b2 challenge. Duration and reason are more 
difficult to identify because they do not have 
well-formed patterns and few knowledge bases 
exist for duration and reasons.
This study only focused on the first step of the 
i2b2 medication extraction challenge ? NER. Our 
next plan is to work on the second step of deter-
mining relations between medication names and 
other entities, thus allowing us to compare our 
results with those reported in the i2b2 challenge. 
In addition, we will also evaluate and compare 
the performance of other ML algorithms such as 
CRF and ME on the same NER task.

5 Conclusions
In this study, we developed an SVM-based NER 
system for medication related entities. We sys-
tematically investigated different types of fea-
tures and our results showed that by combining
semantic features from a rule-based system, the 
ML-based NER system could achieve the best F-
score of 90.05% in recognizing medication re-
lated entities, using the i2b2 annotated data set. 
The experiments also showed that optimized 
usage of external knowledge bases were crucial 
to high performance ML based NER systems for 
medical entities such as drug names.
