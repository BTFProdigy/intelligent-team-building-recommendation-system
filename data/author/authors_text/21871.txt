Abstract
The Irish National  Morphology Database is  a  human-verified,  Official  Standard-compliant 
dataset containing the inflected forms and other morpho-syntactic properties of Irish nouns, 
adjectives, verbs and prepositions. It is being developed by Foras na Gaeilge as part of the 
New English-Irish Dictionary project. This paper introduces this dataset and its accompanying 
software library Gramad?n.
1 Introduction
The Irish National Morphology Database is a side product of the New English-Irish Dictionary project  
at Foras na Gaeilge. During work on the dictionary, a requirement arose to include rich morphological  
information on the target (Irish) side of the dictionary. It has been decided to build a separate morpho-
logical dataset that translations in the dictionary would link to. The result can be viewed at http://fo-
cloir.ie/ where clicking a grammatical label next to a translation opens a window listing the inflec-
ted forms and other morphological properties of the word. The same data can also be viewed separ -
ately at http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/.
2 Database design
The Irish National Morphology Database has been compiled semi-automatically from several sources  
available to Foras na Gaeilge, including a machine-readable version of Focl?ir P?ca and grammatical 
data extracted from WinGl?acht and focal.ie. All data resulting from this process have been proof-read 
and corrected by editors working on the New English-Irish Dictionary project. Therefore, we describe 
the database as a high-accuracy dataset: it does not come with a known margin of error and it is meant  
to have normative force. The language data complies with the Official Standard for Irish (An Caigh-
de?n Oifigi?il 2012).
At time of writing, the database contains 6,736 nouns, 983 adjectives, 1,239 verbs and 16 preposi-
tions. New entries are being added continuously.
Each entry has a unique identifier consisting of the lemma followed by a grammatical label, such as  
bainis_fem2. In cases where the grammatical label is not sufficient to distinguish between homonyms,  
the identifier contains a ?disambiguator?, such as gl?in_fem2_cos (the noun gl?in ?knee? with plural 
gl?ine) versus gl?in_fem2_aois (the noun gl?in ?generation? with plural gl?nta). The disambiguators 
(cos  ?leg?, aois ?age?) are purely mnemotechnic: no attempt is being made to expose the semantics of 
the lemmas, only that two different lemmas exist with two different sets of inflected forms.
The database structure allows for variation everywhere. Every inflected form (for example, every 
combination of case and number) is in essence a list of variants which can contain zero, one or more

50
forms, each with its own grammatical properties. Thus we can accommodate cases when the Offical  
Standard allows for variation, such as the two genitives of talamh ?land? (masculine talaimh and fem-
inine  tal?n). On the other hand, an empty list of variants implies the form does not exist (or is not 
known), for example when a noun has no plural.
The entries are encoded in XML. Every entry comes in two shapes: a minimal format which con-
tains the smallest necessary set of forms and properties, and an expanded format intended for present-
ation to humans. For example, in the case of nouns, the minimal entries contain only one form for each 
number and case (e.g. bainis ?wedding? in singular nominative) while, in the expanded entry, these are 
?expanded? to include definitiveness (bainis ?a wedding?,  an bhainis ?the wedding?). The expanded 
entries are then transformed with XSL into HTML and displayed to human users. The minimal entries 
are intended as a machine-readable resource that can be re-used for other purposes in language techno-
logy, such as for building spellcheckers or for query expansion in fulltext search.
Minimal entries are converted into expanded entries using Gramad?n, a custom-built software lib-
rary written in C#. Gramad?n provides functions for performing grammatical operations such as initial 
mutations,  constructing  noun  phrases  from nouns  and  adjectives,  constructing  verb  phrases  from 
verbs, and so on. The process of converting a minimal entry into an expanded entry is in essence an 
exercise in natural language generation (where syntactic structures are serialized into strings),  and 
Gramad?n is in essence a software library for natural language generation in Irish.
2.1 Nouns
Listing 1 shows a typical noun entry (abhainn ?river?)1 in minimal format, Listing 2 shows the same 
entry in expanded format. Notice that each form (sgNom being singular nominative,  sgGen singular 
genitive and so on) consists of a string (the default attribute) with form-specific properties: singular 
forms have gender while plural forms do not, the plural genitive has strength (a property which signals 
whether the form is weak or strong). Notice that we have decided to treat gender as a property of a  
word form, not a property of the whole lemma. This makes it possible to deal with cases like talamh 
?land? which has two singular genitives, one masculine and one feminine.
2.2 Adjectives
Listing 3 shows a typical adjective entry (b?n ?white?)2 in minimal format, Listing 4 shows the same 
entry in expanded format. The forms of an adjective are less evenly distributed than those of a noun:  
there is one singular nominative, two singular genitives (for agreement with masculine and feminine 
nouns) and only one plural form for all cases (the singular nominative is used for agreement with 
weak-plural genitive nouns). This is sufficient information for Gramad?n to generate the forms needed 
for agreement with all kinds of nouns in all numbers and cases, as can be seen in the expanded format. 
The minimal format also contains a graded form which is used by Gramad?n to generate comparatives 
and superlatives in the past and present.
2.3 Verbs
Listing 5 shows an extract from a typical verb entry (bagair ?threaten?)3 in minimal format, Listing 6 
shows a corresponding extract from the same entry in expanded format. Verbs are more complicated  
than nouns and adjectives in the sense that they contain many more forms. In the Irish National Mor -
phology Database, a verb has forms for up to six tenses (past, past continuous, present, present con-
tinuous, future, conditional) and two moods (imperative, subjunctive). Note that we treat the condi-
tional as a tense because it has the properties of a tense, even though grammar books traditionally cat -
egorize it as a mood.
The difference between a tense and a mood is that a tense can generate forms that are either declar -
ative or interrogative, while a mood can only generate declarative forms (bagair! ?threaten!?,  n? ba-
gair! ?don?t threaten!?).  Consequently, every tense form in the minimal format is labelled as being 
either dependent or independent, while mood forms have no such distinction. The dependent and in-
dependent forms are identical for many verbs, but different for some irregular ones (e.g. d?an ?make? 
1 For a user-friendly presentation of the noun, see http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/abhainn
2 For a user-friendly presentation of the adjective, see http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/b?n
3 For a user-friendly presentation of the verb, see http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/bagair
51
in the past tense: independent rinne, dependent dearna). The independent forms generate positive de-
clarative forms (rinne m? ?I made?), the dependent forms generate all others (n? dhearna m? ?I didn?t 
make?, an ndearna m?? ?did I make??, nach ndearna m?? ?didn?t I make??)
Additionally, every tense and mood form is assigned to a person, which in our analysis is a confla-
tion of person, number and other features: there is a ?base? person from which analytic forms are gen-
erated (rinne ?made? ? rinne muid ?we made?), there are singular/plural first/second/third persons for 
synthetic forms (rinneamar ?we made?), and there is an ?autonomous? person for passive forms of the 
verb (rinneadh ?was made?).
A typical verb has, in its minimal format, about 60 individual forms. This is the set from which  
Gramad?n can generate a verb phrase in any tense or mood, person, number, polarity (positive or neg-
ative) and shape (declarative or interrogative). Unlike other parts of speech where the rules for gener-
ating an expanded entry from a minimal one are completely regular, the verbal component in  Gra-
mad?n has some hard-coded exceptions for a small number of irregular verbs. Also, the verb b? ?be? is 
quite exceptional as it is the only verb that has both a present tense ( t? ?is?) and a continuous present 
tense (b?onn ?habitually is?); other verbs only have a continuous present tense (their non-continuous 
present tense is built analytically from the verbal noun). Finally, the Irish National Morphology Data -
base does not include the copula is, as we do not think it is as a verb.
3 More about Gramad?n
The tool used for processing data in the Irish National Morphology Database,  Gramad?n, deserves 
separate mention. Besides converting entries from minimal to expanded format, Gramad?n has addi-
tional features both below and above the level of words.
Below the level of words, for nouns and adjectives that have not been included in the Irish National  
Morphology Database yet, Gramad?n is able to derive their forms and properties from knowing which 
inflection class they belong to. Unlike the traditional inflection classes found in Irish dictionaries,  
Gramad?n  uses a radically different  system,  inspired by Carnie (2008), where singular and plural 
classes are separate.
Above the level of words, Gramad?n can be used as a realisation engine in an NLG (natural lan-
guage generation) setting. Gramad?n is able to use data from the Irish National Morphology Database 
to construct noun phrases, prepositional phrases and rudimentary clauses while respecting the rules of  
gender and number agreement, initial mutations, case inflections and so on. This aspect of Gramad?n 
is in development and the goal is, eventually, to cover all the basic syntactical phenomena of Irish in-
cluding the construction of clauses containing the copula and the construction of  numbered  noun 
phrases (noun phrases with cardinal and ordinal numerals).
While many of Gramad?n?s features are used for processing the Irish National Morphology Data-
base, it is an independent software tool which has potential applications beyond it.
4 Future plans
The Irish National Morphology Database is work in progress and will continue to be developed by 
Foras na Gaeilge along with other outputs from the New English-Irish Dictionary project. Once the 
database structure has been finalized and detailed documentation has been produced, the whole dataset 
(along with its accompanying tool,  Gramad?n) will  be released under an open-source licence and 
made available for download on the Internet. In the longer term, we plan to develop the natural lan-
guage generation aspect of  Gramad?n  and to use it as a basis for assistive language technology, as 
well as to inform applied research into Irish morphosyntax.

Abstract 
Irish, a low-resourced lesser-used language, is striving to punch above its weight when it comes to some 
of the digital language tools and resources available to its users. High-tech language tools and resources 
for Irish are being developed in a number of universities in Ireland and elsewhere, in language technolo-
gy areas relating to search, parsing, proofing, speech, translation, etc. (Judge at al., 2012). This paper 
aims to highlight work done by researchers at Fiontar, Dublin City University (DCU), to make a number 
of valuable Irish-language terminological, lexicographical, onomastic, and folkloristic data stocks more 
readily accessible, usable, and manageable using web and database technologies. Tools built with these 
technologies have facilitated the re-organisation, distributed development, and more widespread dissem-
ination of these data stocks, as well as the creation of new data stocks. These language tools, which are 
on a par with tools that are available to users of well-resourced languages (take for example the online 
interface of the multilingual terminology database of the European Union, IATE: http://iate.europa.eu/), 
are now enabling Irish language users, language professionals, and linguists operate in an environment 
similar to that of their major language counterparts. The public interfaces of all Irish-language tools and 
resources developed by Fiontar are made available at http://www.gaois.ie/. 
1 Introduction 
Although Irish is a low-resourced language, the Irish Government?s 20 Year Strategy for the Irish 
Language, which prioritises the ?promotion and protection? of the language (Government of Ireland, 
2010), has brought about investment in the creation of digital language tools and resources. Linguistic 
resources, such as printed dictionaries, are now being made available electronically through retro-
digitisation, or being created digitally, and then enhanced with search engines powered by language 
technologies, such as spelling error detection. 
This paper highlights the work done by researchers at Fiontar, Dublin City University (DCU) in the 
identification of valuable non-digital language resources, the digitisation of these resources where 
necessary, and the application of web, database, and language technology to these resources to widen 
access and availability, and to increase effectiveness and usability. 
Fiontar?s tools and resources include public websites that provide easy, user-friendly access to Irish-
language terminological, lexicographical, onomastic, and folkloristic data stocks, as well as web-based 
tools for managing and developing this data. User-friendliness is seen by Fiontar as key in the promo-
tion of the language on the Internet (M?chura and ? Raghallaigh, 2009). Single query, all-in-one 
Google-like search, is also a priority, with sophisticated quick search being a feature on all Fiontar 
websites. All of Fiontar?s digital language tools and resources are made available at or linked to from 
http://www.gaois.ie/ (gaois ?wisdom?).

guage throughout the whole island of Ireland, researchers at Fiontar began development of the Nation-
al Terminology Database for Irish, focal.ie (focal ?word?). Retro-digitisation (where a work that was 
previously published on paper is converted into a digital, computer-readable format) was carried out 
on 54 different dictionaries and term lists supplied by the Terminology Committee of Foras na Gaeilge 
(Bhreathnach, 2007), and the dataset was imported into a purpose-built relational database for termi-
nological and lexicographical data (M?chura, 2006). In addition, two web-based interfaces to the new 
database were developed. The first, a password-protected web application, provided a geographically 
dispersed group of authorised terminologists with access to the data as well as a set of web-based tools 
for editing and developing the data. The second, a public website, gave public access to the data via a 
set of linguistically sophisticated (e.g. inflection awareness, misspelling detection, language selection) 
search tools (M?chura, 2008; M?chura and ? Raghallaigh, 2010). This meant that for the first time, 
Irish-language users, most notably language professionals, had free and searchable worldwide elec-
tronic access to this valuable data stock. 
The focal.ie system continues to be maintained and developed today. The database currently con-
tains over 342,000 terms, mostly in Irish and English. The technology has gone through a number of 
major overhauls. Most notably, the database and (private) editorial interface were replaced in 2012 
with a new system called L?acslann (M?chura, 2012b). In L?acslann, terminological data is now 
stored as XML. L?acslann also incorporates additional features such as user permission management, 
a power search feature which allows users to interrogate the data in complex ways, and an extranet 
application to gather input from external subject and language experts. And in 2013, the public search 
algorithm was optimised for speed and enhanced with better spelling-error detection. 
One of the advantages of the L?acslann system is that multiple data stocks can be stored and man-
aged in the same database. This allows the editorial tools to be reused across multiple terminology and 
lexicography projects. The system now hosts multiple lexical databases being maintained and devel-
oped by Fiontar language experts. It also has the potential to be used to host terminology and lexicog-
raphy projects for other institutions and languages, as it is flexible and customisable. It can be used to 
work with various kinds of stocks such as monolingual and bilingual dictionaries, terminology data-
bases or indeed any sort of reference work. L?acslann stocks can accommodate any language and any 
combination of languages, as long as text in those languages can be encoded in Unicode (M?chura, 
2012b). This might prove to be an economical way to develop such resources for other low-resourced 
languages such as Scottish Gaelic, for example. 
Corpora for use in lexicography have also been developed. One such corpus, a parallel Irish-English 
corpus of Irish and European legal texts, made available to Fiontar by the Irish Government and the 
European Commission, known as ParaDocs, has been made available to the public on gaois.ie. 
3 Onomastics 
In 2007, in partnership with the Placenames Branch of the Government of Ireland, the body that con-
ducts research into the placenames of Ireland to provide authoritative Irish language versions of those 
placenames for official and public use, researchers at Fiontar began development of the Placenames 
Database of Ireland, logainm.ie (logainm ?placename?). A new relational database for bilingual Irish-
English toponymic data was purpose-built for the project, and data already digitised by the Place-
names Branch was imported into this database (Mac Giolla Easpaig, 2009). The architecture adopted 
for the terminology project was reflected in the placenames project in that two web interfaces, one 
public and one private (editorial), were built on top of the placenames database to allow dissemination 
as well as distributed editing and development of the data via the web (M?chura and ? Raghallaigh, 
2012). 
A mapping interface, which used Google maps, was added to the public website in 2010, and in 
2014, the data structure was enhanced with the inclusion of place clusters. These so-called clusters 
better reflect how people think about ?places? such as Donegal, for example. People don't normally 
think about the distinction between the various administrative units called ?Donegal? in County Done-
gal (i.e. the parish, townland, town, and electoral division), all of which are stored as distinct objects in 
the placenames database, but rather think of just one place, Donegal. The new data structure allows 
clustered place objects to be grouped and presented in a more user-friendly way (M?chura, 2012a). 
67
Other developments include a collaboration with the Digital Repository of Ireland to make the da-
taset available as Linked Data, i.e. as exposed RDF data objects that are linked to equivalent objects in 
other geodatasets such as GeoNames (Lopes et al., 2013), and a project to match the dataset with Ord-
nance Survey Ireland so that logainm.ie data can be displayed on OSi maps, and in turn so that those 
maps can be used in place of Google Maps on the website (Byrne et al., 2013). As of May 2014, the 
English and Irish versions of the OSi medium-scale Basemap are being used on logainm.ie in place of 
Google Maps (Satellite View). 
Data, some of which has to be digitised (originating on maps or on hand-written cards, for exam-
ple), continues to be added to the placenames database, and development is ongoing. Additional re-
sources such as maps, articles, and educational resources are also added periodically. The database 
currently contains entries for over 108,000 geographic places on the island of Ireland. 
Another onomastic project, which has recently been established aims to produce a surnames data-
base, which will group related Irish and English surnames. The intention is to use the database to en-
hance the names search interface to the folklore collection described in Section 4, and to make this 
database freely available to search or to download and reuse. The project is in its infancy and will be 
fully reported on at a later date. 
4 Folkloristics 
In 2012, in partnership with the the National Folklore Collection (NFC) at University College Dublin, 
home to one of the largest collections of oral and ethnological material in the world, researchers at 
Fiontar began development of d?chas.ie (d?chas ?heritage?), a new digital version of the NFC. The 
project was initially funded by the Government Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on a 
pilot basis for one year (2012-13) and has now been funded from the same source for three more years 
(2013-16) to digitise, digitally catalogue, and publish online 14% of the NFC. The NFC comprises 
multiple collections, including a music archive, a map archive, an audio and video archive, a collec-
tion of paintings, and a collection of photographs. One collection in particular, a manuscript collection 
comprising handwritten stories, gathered as part of a Government-sponsored scheme in 1937-39, has 
been chosen as the first collection to be migrated to d?chas.ie. Known as The Schools? Collection, it 
was chosen primarily due to its popularity (? Cl?irc?n et al., forthcoming). 
Since The Schools? Collection comprises manuscript only, digitisation in its case involves the scan-
ning of pages to create digital image files. The text written on these pages is not being transcribed, as 
this would be not be feasible, but a digital catalogue of the pages and the stories written on them is 
being compiled as part of the project, to make the collection electronically searchable. It is envisaged 
that 46% of the Schools? Collection, i.e. c. 339,000 pages, will be scanned and catalogued by 2016. 
As with the terminology/lexicography and the placenames projects, the d?chas.ie project comprises 
two web applications, one public and one private (editorial), and two databases, one for each web ap-
plication. The public system is used to present the digitised collections to the world, and provides the 
user with a number of search interfaces. Currently, The Schools? Collection can be searched by person 
(the names of the people who told or collected the stories) or by place (where the stories were collect-
ed). The private system is used to manage and edit the digital catalogue. The contents of the private 
database are transferred to the public database weekly. In this instance, the L?acslann platform was 
reused, and a customised editorial/management application was added for this data stock. 
5 Digitisation, management, and dissemination 
Expertise in digitisation project management, as well as web-based data management and publication 
has allowed Fiontar to transition other Irish language legacy data stocks to the web. One example is 
the biographies database, ainm.ie (ainm ?name?). This project involved the digitisation of nine physical 
volumes of biographies (c. 1,700 lives) written and published between 1986 and 2007. Once again, 
this resource has been digitised, managed online, and published online with associated electronic 
browsing, navigation, and search tools, all of which involved the reuse of existing infrastructure, tech-
nologies, and expertise. Another example is the legacy research sound archive of the Placenames 
Branch, which is accessible to researchers at http://www.logainm.ie/phono/. 
68
6 Technologies and hosting 
All of the projects described here were built using web and database technologies. The Microsoft 
.NET Framework and SQL Server platform were used in each case. Hosting for all websites and data-
bases is provided by DCU Information Systems and Services in conjunction with the HEAnet. Binary 
files created for the d?chas.ie project are hosted by UCD Research IT. 
7 Conclusion 
This paper described some of the tools and resources for Irish developed and made available online by 
Fiontar, Dublin City University, as well as the web and database technologies utilised in their deploy-
ment. It was highlighted that all of these tools and resources encompass technologically and linguisti-
cally sophisticated search interfaces. The use of technology in this way to enhance the resources avail-
