Abstract
Machine reading is a long-standing goal of AI
and NLP. In recent years, tremendous progress
has been made in developing machine learning
approaches for many of its subtasks such as
parsing, information extraction, and question
answering. However, existing end-to-end so-
lutions typically require substantial amount of
human efforts (e.g., labeled data and/or man-
ual engineering), and are not well poised for
Web-scale knowledge acquisition. In this pa-
per, we propose a unifying approach for ma-
chine reading by bootstrapping from the easi-
est extractable knowledge and conquering the
long tail via a self-supervised learning pro-
cess. This self-supervision is powered by joint
inference based on Markov logic, and is made
scalable by leveraging hierarchical structures
and coarse-to-fine inference. Researchers at
the University of Washington have taken the
first steps in this direction. Our existing work
explores the wide spectrum of this vision and
shows its promise.
1 Introduction
Machine reading, or learning by reading, aims to
extract knowledge automatically from unstructured
text and apply the extracted knowledge to end tasks
such as decision making and question answering. It
has been a major goal of AI and NLP since their
early days. With the advent of the Web, the billions
of online text documents contain virtually unlimited
amount of knowledge to extract, further increasing
the importance and urgency of machine reading.
In the past, there has been a lot of progress in
automating many subtasks of machine reading by
machine learning approaches (e.g., components in
the traditional NLP pipeline such as POS tagging
and syntactic parsing). However, end-to-end solu-
tions are still rare, and existing systems typically re-
quire substantial amount of human effort in manual
engineering and/or labeling examples. As a result,
they often target restricted domains and only extract
limited types of knowledge (e.g., a pre-specified re-
lation). Moreover, many machine reading systems
train their knowledge extractors once and do not
leverage further learning opportunities such as ad-
ditional text and interaction with end users.
Ideally, a machine reading system should strive to
satisfy the following desiderata:
End-to-end: the system should input raw text, ex-
tract knowledge, and be able to answer ques-
tions and support other end tasks;
High quality: the system should extract knowledge
with high accuracy;
Large-scale: the system should acquire knowledge
at Web-scale and be open to arbitrary domains,
genres, and languages;
Maximally autonomous: the system should incur
minimal human effort;
Continuous learning from experience: the
system should constantly integrate new infor-
mation sources (e.g., new text documents) and
learn from user questions and feedback (e.g.,
via performing end tasks) to continuously
improve its performance.
These desiderata raise many intriguing and chal-
lenging research questions. Machine reading re-
search at the University of Washington has explored
87
a wide spectrum of solutions to these challenges and
has produced a large number of initial systems that
demonstrated promising performance. During this
expedition, an underlying unifying vision starts to
emerge. It becomes apparent that the key to solving
machine reading is to:
1. Conquer the long tail of textual knowledge via
a self-supervised learning process that lever-
ages data redundancy to bootstrap from the
head and propagates information down the long
tail by joint inference;
2. Scale this process to billions of Web documents
by identifying and leveraging ubiquitous struc-
tures that lead to sparsity.
In Section 2, we present this vision in detail, iden-
tify the major dimensions these initial systems have
explored, and propose a unifying approach that sat-
isfies all five desiderata. In Section 3, we reivew
machine reading research at the University of Wash-
ington and show how they form synergistic effort
towards solving the machine reading problem. We
conclude in Section 4.
2 A Unifying Approach for Machine
Reading
The core challenges to machine reading stem from
the massive scale of the Web and the long-tailed dis-
tribution of textual knowledge. The heterogeneous
Web contains texts that vary substantially in subject
matters (e.g., finance vs. biology) and writing styles
(e.g., blog posts vs. scientific papers). In addition,
natural languages are famous for their myraid vari-
ations in expressing the same meaning. A fact may
be stated in a straightforward way such as ?kale con-
tains calcium?. More often though, it may be stated
in a syntactically and/or lexically different way than
as phrased in an end task (e.g., ?calcium is found in
kale?). Finally, many facts are not even stated ex-
plicitly, and must be inferred from other facts (e.g.,
?kale prevents osteoporosis? may not be stated ex-
plicitly but can be inferred by combining facts such
as ?kale contains calcium? and ?calcium helps pre-
vent osteoporosis?). As a result, machine reading
must not rely on explicit supervision such as manual
rules and labeled examples, which will incur pro-
hibitive cost in the Web scale. Instead, it must be
able to learn from indirect supervision.

Figure 1: A unifying vision for machine reading: boot-
strap from the head regime of the power-law distribu-
tion of textual knowledge, and conquer the long tail in
a self-supervised learning process that raises certainty on
sparse extractions by propagating information via joint
inference from frequent extractions.
A key source of indirect supervision is meta
knowledge about the domains. For example, the
TextRunner system (Banko et al, 2007) hinges on
the observation that there exist general, relation-
independent patterns for information extraction. An-
other key source of indirect supervision is data re-
dundancy. While a rare extracted fact or inference
pattern may arise by chance of error, it is much less
likely so for the ones with many repetitions (Downey
et al, 2010). Such highly-redundant knowledge can
be extracted easily and with high confidence, and
can be leveraged for bootstrapping. For knowledge
that resides in the long tail, explicit forms of redun-
dancy (e.g., identical expressions) are rare, but this
can be circumvented by joint inference. For exam-
ple, expressions that are composed with or by sim-
ilar expressions probably have the same meaning;
the fact that kale prevents osteoporosis can be de-
rived by combining the facts that kale contains cal-
cium and that calcium helps prevent osteoporosis via
a transitivity-through inference pattern. In general,
joint inference can take various forms, ranging from
simple voting to shrinkage in a probabilistic ontol-
ogy to sophisticated probabilistic reasoning based
on a joint model. Simple ones tend to scale bet-
ter, but their capability in propagating information
is limited. More sophisticated methods can uncover
implicit redundancy and propagate much more in-
88
formation with higher quality, yet the challenge is
how to make them scale as well as simple ones.
To do machine reading, a self-supervised learning
process, informed by meta knowledege, stipulates
what form of joint inference to use and how. Effec-
tively, it increases certainty on sparse extractions by
propagating information from more frequent ones.
Figure 1 illustrates this unifying vision.
In the past, machine reading research at the Uni-
versity of Washington has explored a variety of so-
lutions that span the key dimensions of this uni-
fying vision: knowledge representation, bootstrap-
ping, self-supervised learning, large-scale joint in-
ference, ontology induction, continuous learning.
See Section 3 for more details. Based on this ex-
perience, one direction seems particularly promising
that we would propose here as our unifying approach
for end-to-end machine reading:
Markov logic is used as the unifying framework for
knowledge representation and joint inference;
Self-supervised learning is governed by a joint
probabilistic model that incorporates a small
amount of heuristic knowledge and large-scale
relational structures to maximize the amount
and quality of information to propagate;
Joint inference is made scalable to the Web by
coarse-to-fine inference.
Probabilistic ontologies are induced from text to
guarantee tractability in coarse-to-fine infer-
ence. This ontology induction and popula-
tion are incorporated into the joint probabilistic
model for self-supervision;
Continuous learning is accomplished by combin-
ing bootstrapping and crowdsourced content
creation to synergistically improve the reading
system from user interaction and feedback.
A distinctive feature of this approach is its empha-
sis on using sophisticated joint inference. Recently,
joint inference has received increasing interest in
AI, machine learning, and NLP, with Markov logic
(Domingos and Lowd, 2009) being one of the lead-
ing unifying frameworks. Past work has shown that
it can substantially improve predictive accuracy in
supervised learning (e.g., (Getoor and Taskar, 2007;
Bakir et al, 2007)). We propose to build on these ad-
vances, but apply joint inference beyond supervised
learning, with labeled examples supplanted by indi-
rect supervision.
Another distinctive feature is that we propose
to use coarse-to-fine inference (Felzenszwalb and
McAllester, 2007; Petrov, 2009) as a unifying
framework to scale inference to the Web. Es-
sentially, coarse-to-fine inference leverages the
sparsity imposed by hierarchical structures that
are ubiquitous in human knowledge (e.g., tax-
onomies/ontologies). At coarse levels (top levels in
a hierarchy), ambiguities are rare (there are few ob-
jects and relations), and inference can be conducted
very efficiently. The result is then used to prune un-
promising refinements at the next level. This process
continues down the hierarchy until decision can be
made. In this way, inference can potentially be sped
up exponentially, analogous to binary tree search.
Finally, we propose a novel form of continuous
learning by leveraging the interaction between the
system and end users to constantly improve the per-
formance. This is straightforward to do in our ap-
proach given the self-supervision process and the
availability of powerful joint inference. Essentially,
when the system output is applied to an end task
(e.g., answering questions), the feedback from user
is collected and incorporated back into the system
as a bootstrap source. The feedback can take the
form of explicit supervision (e.g., via community
content creation or active learning) or indirect sig-
nals (e.g., click data and query logs). In this way,
we can bootstrap an online community by an initial
machine reading system that provides imperfect but
valuable service in end tasks, and continuously im-
prove the quality of system output, which attracts
more users with higher degree of participation, thus
creating a positive feedback loop and raising the ma-
chine reading performance to a high level that is dif-
ficult to attain otherwise.
3 Summary of Progress to Date
The University of Washington has been one of the
leading places for machine reading research and has
produced many cutting-edge systems, e.g., WIEN
(first wrapper induction system for information ex-
traction), Mulder (first fully automatic Web-scale
question answering system), KnowItAll/TextRunner
(first systems to do open-domain information extrac-
89
tion from the Web corpus at large scale), Kylin (first
self-supervised system for Wikipedia-based infor-
mation extraction), UCR (first unsupervised corefer-
ence resolution system that rivals the performance of
supervised systems), Holmes (first Web-scale joint
inference system), USP (first unsupervised system
for semantic parsing).
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the major sys-
tems; dashed lines signify influence in key ideas
(e.g., Mulder inspires KnowItAll), and solid lines
signify dataflow (e.g., Holmes inputs TextRunner tu-
ples). These systems span a wide spectrum in scal-
ability (assessed by speed and quantity in extrac-
tion) and comprehension (assessed by unit yield of
knowledge at a fixed precision level). At one ex-
treme, the TextRunner system is highly scalable, ca-
pable of extracting billions of facts, but it focuses on
shallow extractions from simple sentences. At the
other extreme, the USP and LOFT systems achieve
much higher level of comprehension (e.g., in a task
of extracting knowledge from biomedical papers and
answering questions, USP obtains more than three
times as many correct answers as TextRunner, and
LOFT obtains more than six times as many correct
answers as TextRunner), but are much less scalable
than TextRunner.
In the remainder of the section, we review the
progress made to date and identify key directions for
future work.
3.1 Knowledge Representation and Joint
Inference
Knowledge representations used in these systems
vary widely in expressiveness, ranging from sim-
ple ones like relation triples (<subject, relation,
object>; e.g., in KnowItAll and TextRunner), to
clusters of relation triples or triple components (e.g.,
in SNE, RESOLVER), to arbitrary logical formulas
and their clusters (e.g., in USP, LOFT). Similarly,
a variety forms of joint inference have been used,
ranging from simple voting to heuristic rules to so-
phisticated probabilistic models. All these can be
compactly encoded in Markov logic (Domingos and
Lowd, 2009), which provides a unifying framework
for knowledge representation and joint inference.
Past work at Washington has shown that in su-
pervised learning, joint inference can substantially
improve predictive performance on tasks related to
machine reading (e.g., citation information extrac-
tion (Poon and Domingos, 2007), ontology induc-
tion (Wu and Weld, 2008), temporal information
extraction (Ling and Weld, 2010)). In addition, it
has demonstrated that sophisticated joint inference
can enable effective learning without any labeled
information (UCR, USP, LOFT), and that joint in-
ference can scale to millions of Web documents by
leveraging sparsity in naturally occurring relations
(Holmes, Sherlock), showing the promise of our uni-
fying approach.
Simpler representations limit the expressiveness
in representing knowledge and the degree of sophis-
tication in joint inference, but they currently scale
much better than more expressive ones. A key direc-
tion for future work is to evaluate this tradeoff more
thoroughly, e.g., for each class of end tasks, to what
degree do simple representations limit the effective-
ness in performing the end tasks? Can we automate
the choice of representations to strike the best trade-
off for a specific end task? Can we advance joint
inference algorithms to such a degree that sophisti-
cated inference scales as well as simple ones?
3.2 Bootstrapping
Past work at Washington has identified and lever-
aged a wide range of sources for bootstrapping. Ex-
amples include Wikipedia (Kylin, KOG, IIA, WOE,
WPE), Web lists (KnowItAll, WPE), Web tables
(WebTables), Hearst patterns (KnowItAll), heuristic
rules (TextRunner), semantic role labels (SRL-IE),
etc.
In general, potential bootstrap sources can be
broadly divided into domain knowledge (e.g., pat-
terns and rules) and crowdsourced contents (e.g., lin-
guistic resources, Wikipedia, Amazon Mechanical
Turk, the ESP game).
A key direction for future work is to combine
bootstrapping with crowdsourced content creation
for continuous learning. (Also see Subsection 3.6.)
3.3 Self-Supervised Learning
Although the ways past systems conduct self-
supervision vary widely in detail, they can be di-
vided into two broad categories. One uses heuristic
rules that exploit existing semi-structured resources
to generate noisy training examples for use by su-
pervised learning methods and with cotraining (e.g.,
