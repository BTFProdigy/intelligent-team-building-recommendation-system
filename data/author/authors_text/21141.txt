Abstract
The CoNLL-2013 shared task was devoted
to grammatical error correction. In this
paper, we give the task definition, present
the data sets, and describe the evaluation
metric and scorer used in the shared task.
We also give an overview of the various
approaches adopted by the participating
teams, and present the evaluation results.
1 Introduction
Grammatical error correction is the shared task
of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational
Natural Language Learning in 2013 (CoNLL-
2013). In this task, given an English essay written
by a learner of English as a second language, the
goal is to detect and correct the grammatical errors
present in the essay, and return the corrected essay.
This task has attracted much recent research in-
terest, with two shared tasks Helping Our Own
(HOO) 2011 and 2012 organized in the past two
years (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al,
2012). In contrast to previous CoNLL shared tasks
which focused on particular subtasks of natural
language processing, such as named entity recog-
nition, semantic role labeling, dependency pars-
ing, or coreference resolution, grammatical error
correction aims at building a complete end-to-end
application. This task is challenging since for
many error types, current grammatical error cor-
rection systems do not achieve high performance
and much research is still needed. Also, tackling
this task has far-reaching impact, since it is esti-
mated that hundreds of millions of people world-
wide are learning English and they benefit directly
from an automated grammar checker.
The CoNLL-2013 shared task provides a forum
for participating teams to work on the same gram-
matical error correction task, with evaluation on
the same blind test set using the same evaluation
metric and scorer. This overview paper contains a
detailed description of the shared task, and is orga-
nized as follows. Section 2 provides the task def-
inition. Section 3 describes the annotated training
data provided and the blind test data. Section 4 de-
scribes the evaluation metric and the scorer. Sec-
tion 5 lists the participating teams and outlines the
approaches to grammatical error correction used
by the teams. Section 6 presents the results of the
shared task. Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Task Definition
The goal of the CoNLL-2013 shared task is to
evaluate algorithms and systems for automati-
cally detecting and correcting grammatical errors
present in English essays written by second lan-
guage learners of English. Each participating
team is given training data manually annotated
with corrections of grammatical errors. The test
data consists of new, blind test essays. Prepro-
cessed test essays, which have been sentence-
segmented and tokenized, are also made available
to the participating teams. Each team is to submit
its system output consisting of the automatically
corrected essays, in sentence-segmented and tok-
enized form.
Grammatical errors consist of many different
types, including articles or determiners, preposi-
tions, noun form, verb form, subject-verb agree-
ment, pronouns, word choice, sentence structure,
punctuation, capitalization, etc. Of all the er-
ror types, determiners and prepositions are among
1
the most frequent errors made by learners of En-
glish. Not surprisingly, much published research
on grammatical error correction focuses on arti-
cle and preposition errors (Han et al, 2006; Ga-
mon, 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010; Tetreault
et al, 2010; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011b), with rel-
atively less work on correcting word choice errors
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011a). Article and preposi-
tion errors were also the only error types featured
in the HOO 2012 shared task. Likewise, although
all error types were included in the HOO 2011
shared task, almost all participating teams dealt
with article and preposition errors only (besides
spelling and punctuation errors).
In the CoNLL-2013 shared task, it was felt
that the community is now ready to deal with
more error types, including noun number, verb
form, and subject-verb agreement, besides arti-
cles/determiners and prepositions. Table 1 shows
examples of the five error types in our shared task.
Since there are five error types in our shared task
compared to two in HOO 2012, there is a greater
chance of encountering multiple, interacting errors
in a sentence in our shared task. This increases the
complexity of our shared task relative to that of
HOO 2012. To illustrate, consider the following
sentence:
Although we have to admit some bad
effect which is brought by the new
technology, still the advantages of the
new technologies cannot be simply dis-
carded.
The noun number error effect needs to be corrected
(effect? effects). This necessitates the correction
of a subject-verb agreement error (is ? are). A
pipeline system in which corrections for subject-
verb agreement errors occur strictly before correc-
tions for noun number errors would not be able
to arrive at a fully corrected sentence for this ex-
ample. The ability to correct multiple, interacting
errors is thus necessary in our shared task. The re-
cent work of (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a), for ex-
ample, is designed to deal with multiple, interact-
ing errors.
Note that the essays in the training data and the
test essays naturally contain grammatical errors of
all types, beyond the five error types focused in our
shared task. In the automatically corrected essays
returned by a participating system, only correc-
tions necessary to correct errors of the five types
are made. The other errors are to be left uncor-
rected.
3 Data
This section describes the training and test data
released to each participating team in our shared
task.
3.1 Training Data
The training data provided in our shared task is
the NUCLE corpus, the NUS Corpus of Learner
English (Dahlmeier et al, 2013). As noted by
(Leacock et al, 2010), the lack of a manually an-
notated and corrected corpus of English learner
texts has been an impediment to progress in gram-
matical error correction, since it prevents com-
parative evaluations on a common benchmark test
data set. NUCLE was created precisely to fill this
void. It is a collection of 1,414 essays written
by students at the National University of Singa-
pore (NUS) who are non-native speakers of En-
glish. The essays were written in response to some
prompts, and they cover a wide range of topics,
such as environmental pollution, health care, etc.
The grammatical errors in these essays have been
hand-corrected by professional English instructors
at NUS. For each grammatical error instance, the
start and end character offsets of the erroneous text
span are marked, and the error type and the cor-
rection string are provided. Manual annotation is
carried out using a graphical user interface specif-
ically built for this purpose. The error annotations
are saved as stand-off annotations, in SGML for-
mat.
To illustrate, consider the following sentence at
the start of the first paragraph of an essay:
From past to the present, many impor-
tant innovations have surfaced.
There is an article/determiner error (past ? the
past) in this sentence. The error annotation, also
called correction or edit, in SGML format is
shown in Figure 1. start par (end par) de-
notes the paragraph ID of the start (end) of the er-
roneous text span (paragraph ID starts from 0 by
convention). start off (end off) denotes the
character offset of the start (end) of the erroneous
text span (again, character offset starts from 0 by
convention). The error tag is ArtOrDet, and the
correction string is the past.

Figure 1: An example error annotation.
The NUCLE corpus was first used in
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011b), and has been
publicly available for research purposes since
June 20111. All instances of grammatical errors
are annotated in NUCLE, and the errors are
classified into 27 error types (Dahlmeier et al,
2013).
To help participating teams in their prepara-
tion for the shared task, we also performed au-
tomatic preprocessing of the NUCLE corpus and
released the preprocessed form of NUCLE. The
preprocessing operations performed on the NU-
CLE essays include sentence segmentation and
word tokenization using the NLTK toolkit (Bird
et al, 2009), and part-of-speech (POS) tagging,
constituency and dependency tree parsing using
the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003;
de Marneffe et al, 2006). The error annotations,
which are originally at the character level, are
then mapped to error annotations at the word to-
ken level. Error annotations at the word token
1http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/?nlp/corpora.html
level also facilitate scoring, as we will see in Sec-
tion 4, since our scorer operates by matching to-
kens. Note that although we released our own
preprocessed version of NUCLE, the participating
teams were however free to perform their own pre-
processing if they so preferred.
3.1.1 Revised version of NUCLE
NUCLE release version 2.3 was used in the
CoNLL-2013 shared task. In this version, 17 es-
says were removed from the first release of NU-
CLE since these essays were duplicates with mul-
tiple annotations.
In the original NUCLE corpus, there is not an
explicit preposition error type. Instead, prepo-
sition errors are part of the Wcip (wrong collo-
cation/idiom/preposition) and Rloc (local redun-
dancy) error types. The Wcip error type combines
errors concerning collocations, idioms, and prepo-
sitions together into one error type. The Rloc er-
ror type annotates extraneous words which are re-
dundant and should be removed, and they include
redundant articles, determiners, and prepositions.

Table 2: Statistics of training and test data.
In our shared task, in order to facilitate the detec-
tion and correction of article/determiner errors and
preposition errors, we performed automatic map-
ping of error types in the original NUCLE cor-
pus. The mapping relies on POS tags, constituent
parse trees, and error annotations at the word token
level. Specifically, we map the error types Wcip
and Rloc to Prep, Wci, ArtOrDet, and Rloc?.
Prepositions in the error type Wcip or Rloc are
mapped to a new error type Prep, and redundant
articles or determiners in the error type Rloc are
mapped to ArtOrDet. The remaining unaffected
Wcip errors are assigned the new error type Wci
and the remaining unaffected Rloc errors are as-
signed the new error type Rloc?. The code that
performs automatic error type mapping was also
provided to the participating teams.
The statistics of the NUCLE corpus (release 2.3
version) are shown in Table 2. The distribution
of errors among the five error types is shown in
Table 3. The newly added noun number error type
in our shared task accounts for the second highest
number of errors among the five error types. The
five error types in our shared task constitute 35%
of all grammatical errors in the training data, and
47% of all errors in the test data. These figures
support our choice of these five error types to be
the focus of our shared task, since they account
for a large percentage of all grammatical errors in
English learner essays.
While the NUCLE corpus is provided in our
shared task, participating teams are free to not use
NUCLE, or to use additional resources and tools
in building their grammatical error correction sys-
tems, as long as these resources and tools are pub-
licly available and not proprietary. For example,
participating teams are free to use the Cambridge
FCE corpus (Yannakoudakis et al, 2011; Nicholls,
2003) (the training data provided in HOO 2012
(Dale et al, 2012)) as additional training data.

3.2 Test Data
25 NUS students, who are non-native speakers of
English, were recruited to write new essays to be
used as blind test data in the shared task. Each
student wrote two essays in response to the two
prompts shown in Table 4, one essay per prompt.
Essays written using the first prompt are present
in the NUCLE training data, while the second
prompt is a new prompt not used previously. As
a result, 50 test essays were collected. The statis-
tics of the test essays are shown in Table 2.
Error annotation on the test essays was carried
out by a native speaker of English who is a lecturer
at the NUS Centre for English Language Commu-
nication. The distribution of errors in the test es-
says among the five error types is shown in Ta-
ble 3. The test essays were then preprocessed in
the same manner as the NUCLE corpus. The pre-
processed test essays were released to the partici-
pating teams.
Unlike the test data used in HOO 2012 which
was proprietary and not available after the shared
task, the test essays and their error annotations in
the CoNLL-2013 shared task are freely available
after the shared task.
4 Evaluation Metric and Scorer
A grammatical error correction system is evalu-
ated by how well its proposed corrections or edits
match the gold-standard edits. An essay is first
sentence-segmented and tokenized before evalua-
tion is carried out on the essay. To illustrate, con-
sider the following tokenized sentence S written
by an English learner:
There is no a doubt, tracking system

track people (e.g., human implants and RFID tags on people or products). Do you agree? Sup-
port your argument with concrete examples.
2 Population aging is a global phenomenon. Studies have shown that the current average life span
is over 65. Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in
developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually. Explain why rising life
expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement.

has brought many benefits in this infor-
mation age .
The set of gold-standard edits of a human annota-
tor is g = {a doubt ? doubt, system ? systems,
has ? have}. Suppose the tokenized output sen-
tence H of a grammatical error correction system
given the above sentence is:
There is no doubt, tracking system has
brought many benefits in this informa-
tion age .
That is, the set of system edits is e = {a doubt
? doubt}. The performance of the grammatical
error correction system is measured by how well
the two sets g and e match, in the form of recall
R, precision P , and F1 measure: R = 1/3, P =
1/1, F1 = 2RP/(R + P ) = 1/2.
More generally, given a set of n sentences,
where gi is the set of gold-standard edits for sen-
tence i, and ei is the set of system edits for sen-
tence i, recall, precision, and F1 are defined as
follows:
R =
?n
i=1 |gi ? ei|?n
i=1 |gi|
(1)
P =
?n
i=1 |gi ? ei|?n
i=1 |ei|
(2)
F1 =
2?R? P
R + P
(3)
where the intersection between gi and ei for sen-
tence i is defined as
gi ? ei = {e ? ei|?g ? gi,match(g, e)} (4)
Evaluation by the HOO scorer (Dale and Kilgar-
riff, 2011) is based on computing recall, precision,
and F1 measure as defined above.
Note that there are multiple ways to specify a
set of gold-standard edits that denote the same cor-
rections. For example, in the above learner-written
sentence S, alternative but equivalent sets of gold-
standard edits are {a ? , system ? systems, has
? have}, {a ? , system has ? systems have},
etc. Given the same learner-written sentence S
and the same system output sentence H shown
above, one would expect a scorer to give the same
R,P, F1 scores regardless of which of the equiv-
alent sets of gold-standard edits is specified by an
annotator.
However, this is not the case with the HOO
scorer. This is because the HOO scorer uses
GNU wdiff2 to extract the differences between
the learner-written sentence S and the system out-
put sentence H to form a set of system edits.
Since in general there are multiple ways to spec-
ify a set of gold-standard edits that denote the
same corrections, the set of system edits com-
puted by the HOO scorer may not match the set of
gold-standard edits specified, leading to erroneous
scores. In the above example, the set of system
edits computed by the HOO scorer for S and H is
{a ? }. Given that the set of gold-standard edits
g is {a doubt ? doubt, system ? systems, has ?
have}, the scores computed by the HOO scorer are
R = P = F1 = 0, which are erroneous.
The MaxMatch (M2) scorer3 (Dahlmeier and
Ng, 2012b) was designed to overcome this limita-
tion of the HOO scorer. The key idea is that the
set of system edits automatically computed and
used in scoring should be the set that maximally
matches the set of gold-standard edits specified by
the annotator. The M2 scorer uses an efficient al-
gorithm to search for such a set of system edits
using an edit lattice. In the above example, given
S, H , and g, the M2 scorer is able to come up
with the best matching set of system edits e = {a
doubt ? doubt}, thus giving the correct scores
R = 1/3, P = 1/1, F1 = 1/2. We use the M2
2http://www.gnu.org/s/wdiff/
3http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/?nlp/software.html
5
scorer in the CoNLL-2013 shared task.
The original M2 scorer implemented in
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b) assumes that there
is one set of gold-standard edits gi for each
sentence i. However, it is often the case that
multiple alternative corrections are acceptable for
a sentence. As we allow participating teams to
submit alternative sets of gold-standard edits for
a sentence, we also extend the M2 scorer to deal
with multiple alternative sets of gold-standard
edits.
Based on Equations 1 and 2, Equation 3 can be
re-expressed as:
F1 =
2?
?n
i=1 |gi ? ei|?n
i=1 (|gi|+ |ei|)
(5)
To deal with multiple alternative sets of gold-
standard edits gi for a sentence i, the extended
M2 scorer chooses the gi that maximizes the cu-
mulative F1 score for sentences 1, . . . , i. Ties
are broken based on the following criteria: first
choose the gi that maximizes the numerator?n
i=1 |gi ? ei|, then choose the gi that minimizes
the denominator
?n
i=1 (|gi|+ |ei|), finally choose
the gi that appears first in the list of alternatives.
5 Approaches
54 teams registered to participate in the shared
task, out of which 17 teams submitted the output
of their grammatical error correction systems by
the deadline. These teams are listed in Table 5.
Each team is assigned a 3 to 4-letter team ID. In
the remainder of this paper, we will use the as-
signed team ID to refer to a participating team.
Every team submitted a system description paper
(the only exception is the SJT2 team).
Many different approaches are adopted by par-
ticipating teams in the CoNLL-2013 shared task,
and Table 6 summarizes these approaches. A com-
monly used approach in the shared task and in
grammatical error correction research in general
is to build a classifier for each error type. For ex-
ample, the classifier for noun number returns the
classes {singular, plural}, the classifier for article
returns the classes {a/an, the, }, etc. The classi-
fier for an error type may be learned from train-
ing examples encoding the surrounding context of
an error occurrence, or may be specified by deter-
ministic hand-crafted rules, or may be built using
a hybrid approach combining both machine learn-
ing and hand-crafted rules. These approaches are
denoted by M, R, and H respectively in Table 6.
The machine translation approach (denoted by
T in Table 6) to grammatical error correction
treats the task as ?translation? from bad English
to good English. Both phrase-based translation
and syntax-based translation approaches are used
by teams in the CoNLL-2013 shared task. An-
other related approach is the language modeling
approach (denoted by L in Table 6), in which
the probability of a learner sentence is compared
with the probability of a candidate corrected sen-
tence, based on a language model built from a
background corpus. The candidate correction is
chosen if it results in a corrected sentence with a
higher probability. In general, these approaches
are not mutually exclusive. For example, the
work of (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a; Yoshimoto et
al., 2013) includes elements of machine learning-
based classification, machine translation, and lan-
guage modeling approaches.
When different approaches are used to tackle
different error types by a system, we break down
the error types into different rows in Table 6, and
specify the approach used for each group of error
types. For instance, the HIT team uses a machine
learning approach to deal with article/determiner,
noun number, and preposition errors, and a rule-
based approach to deal with subject-verb agree-
ment and verb form errors. As such, the entry for
HIT is sub-divided into two rows, to make it clear
which particular error type is handled by which
approach.
Table 6 also shows the linguistic features used
by the participating teams, which include lexical
features (i.e., words, collocations, n-grams), parts-
of-speech (POS), constituency parses, dependency
parses, and semantic features (including semantic
role labels).
While all teams in the shared task use the NU-
CLE corpus, they are also allowed to use addi-
tional external resources (both corpora and tools)
so long as they are publicly available and not pro-
prietary. The external resources used by the teams
are also listed in Table 6.
6 Results
All submitted system output was evaluated using
the M2 scorer, based on the error annotations pro-
vided by our annotator. The recall (R), precision
(P ), and F1 measure of all teams are shown in Ta-
ble 7. The performance of the teams varies greatly,

from barely half a per cent to 31.20% for the top
team.
The nature of grammatical error correction is
such that multiple, different corrections are of-
ten acceptable. In order to allow the participating
teams to raise their disagreement with the original
gold-standard annotations provided by the anno-
tator, and not understate the performance of the
teams, we allow the teams to submit their pro-
posed alternative answers. This was also the prac-
tice adopted in HOO 2011 and HOO 2012. Specif-
ically, after the teams submitted their system out-
put and the error annotations on the test essays
were released, we allowed the teams to propose al-
ternative answers (gold-standard edits), to be sub-
mitted within four days after the initial error an-
notations were released. The same annotator who
provided the error annotations on the test essays
also judged the alternative answers proposed by
the teams, to ensure consistency. In all, five teams
(NTHU, STEL, TOR, UIUC, UMC) submitted al-
ternative answers.
The same submitted system output was then
evaluated using the extended M2 scorer, with the
original annotations augmented with the alterna-
tive answers. Table 8 shows the recall (R), preci-
sion (P ), and F1 measure of all teams under this
new evaluation setting.
The F1 measure of every team improves when

evaluated with alternative answers. Not surpris-
ingly, the teams which submitted alternative an-
swers tend to show the greatest improvements in
their F1 measure. Overall, the UIUC team (Ro-
zovskaya et al, 2013) achieves the best F1 mea-
sure, with a clear lead over the other teams in the
shared task, under both evaluation settings (with-
out and with alternative answers).
For future research which uses the test data of
the CoNLL-2013 shared task, we recommend that
evaluation be carried out in the setting that does
not use alternative answers, to ensure a fairer eval-
uation. This is because the scores of the teams
which submitted alternative answers tend to be
higher in a biased way when evaluated with alter-
native answers.

Table 8: Scores (in %) with alternative answers.
We are also interested in the analysis of scores
of each of the five error types. To compute the
recall of an error type, we need to know the er-
ror type of each gold-standard edit, which is pro-
vided by the annotator. To compute the precision
of each error type, we need to know the error type
of each system edit, which however is not avail-
able since the submitted system output only con-
tains the corrected sentences with no indication of
the error type of the system edits.
In order to determine the error type of system
edits, we first perform POS tagging on the submit-
ted system output using the Stanford parser (Klein
andManning, 2003). We also make use of the POS
tags assigned in the preprocessed form of the test
essays. We then assign an error type to a system
edit based on the automatically determined POS
tags, as follows:
? ArtOrDet: The system edit involves a change
(insertion, deletion, or substitution) of words
tagged as article/determiner, i.e., DT or PDT.
? Prep: The system edit involves a change of
words tagged as preposition, i.e., IN or TO.
? Nn: The system edit involves a change of
words such that a word in the source string
is a singular noun (tagged as NN or NNP)
and a word in the replacement string is a plu-
ral noun (tagged as NNS or NNPS), or vice
versa. Since a word tagged as JJ (adjective)
can serve as a noun, a system edit that in-
volves a change of POS tags from JJ to one of
{NN, NNP, NNS, NNPS} or vice versa also
qualifies.
? Vform/SVA: The system edit involves a
change of words tagged as one of the verb
POS tags, i.e., VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP,
and VBZ.
The verb form and subject-verb agreement error
types are grouped together into one category, since
it is difficult to automatically distinguish the two in
a reliable way.
The scores when distinguished by error type are
shown in Tables 9 and 10. Based on the F1 mea-
sure of each error type, the noun number error type
gives the highest scores, and preposition errors re-
main the most challenging error type to correct.
7 Conclusions
The CoNLL-2013 shared task saw the participa-
tion of 17 teams worldwide to evaluate their gram-
matical error correction systems on a common test
set, using a common evaluation metric and scorer.
The five error types included in the shared task
account for at least one-third to close to one-half
of all errors in English learners? essays. The best
system in the shared task achieves an F1 score of
42%, when it is scored with multiple acceptable
answers. There is still much room for improve-
ment, both in the accuracy of grammatical error
correction systems, and in the coverage of systems
to deal with a more comprehensive set of error

Abstract
The CoNLL-2014 shared task was devoted
to grammatical error correction of all error
types. In this paper, we give the task defi-
nition, present the data sets, and describe
the evaluation metric and scorer used in
the shared task. We also give an overview
of the various approaches adopted by the
participating teams, and present the eval-
uation results. Compared to the CoNLL-
2013 shared task, we have introduced the
following changes in CoNLL-2014: (1)
A participating system is expected to de-
tect and correct grammatical errors of all
types, instead of just the five error types
in CoNLL-2013; (2) The evaluation metric
was changed from F
1
to F
0.5
, to empha-
size precision over recall; and (3) We have
two human annotators who independently
annotated the test essays, compared to just
one human annotator in CoNLL-2013.
1 Introduction
Grammatical error correction is the shared task of
the Eighteenth Conference on Computational Nat-
ural Language Learning in 2014 (CoNLL-2014).
In this task, given an English essay written by a
learner of English as a second language, the goal
is to detect and correct the grammatical errors of
all error types present in the essay, and return the
corrected essay.
This task has attracted much recent research in-
terest, with two shared tasks Helping Our Own
(HOO) organized in 2011 and 2012 (Dale and Kil-
garriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012), and a CoNLL
shared task on grammatical error correction orga-
nized in 2013 (Ng et al., 2013). In contrast to
previous CoNLL shared tasks which focused on
particular subtasks of natural language process-
ing, such as named entity recognition, semantic
role labeling, dependency parsing, or coreference
resolution, grammatical error correction aims at
building a complete end-to-end application. This
task is challenging since for many error types,
current grammatical error correction systems do
not achieve high performance and much research
is still needed. Also, tackling this task has far-
reaching impact, since it is estimated that hun-
dreds of millions of people worldwide are learn-
ing English and they benefit directly from an auto-
mated grammar checker.
The CoNLL-2014 shared task provides a forum
for participating teams to work on the same gram-
matical error correction task, with evaluation on
the same blind test set using the same evaluation
metric and scorer. This overview paper contains a
detailed description of the shared task, and is orga-
nized as follows. Section 2 provides the task def-
inition. Section 3 describes the annotated training
data provided and the blind test data. Section 4 de-
scribes the evaluation metric and the scorer. Sec-
tion 5 lists the participating teams and outlines the
approaches to grammatical error correction used
by the teams. Section 6 presents the results of the
shared task, including a discussion on cross anno-
tator comparison. Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Task Definition
The goal of the CoNLL-2014 shared task is to
evaluate algorithms and systems for automati-
cally detecting and correcting grammatical errors
1
present in English essays written by second lan-
guage learners of English. Each participating
team is given training data manually annotated
with corrections of grammatical errors. The test
data consists of new, blind test essays. Prepro-
cessed test essays, which have been sentence-
segmented and tokenized, are also made available
to the participating teams. Each team is to submit
its system output consisting of the automatically
corrected essays, in sentence-segmented and tok-
enized form.
Grammatical errors consist of many different
types, including articles or determiners, preposi-
tions, noun form, verb form, subject-verb agree-
ment, pronouns, word choice, sentence structure,
punctuation, capitalization, etc. However, most
prior published research on grammatical error cor-
rection only focuses on a small number of fre-
quently occurring error types, such as article and
preposition errors (Han et al., 2006; Gamon, 2010;
Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010; Tetreault et al., 2010;
Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011b). Article and preposi-
tion errors were also the only error types featured
in the HOO 2012 shared task. Likewise, although
all error types were included in the HOO 2011
shared task, almost all participating teams dealt
with article and preposition errors only (besides
spelling and punctuation errors). In the CoNLL-
2013 shared task, the error types were extended
to include five error types, comprising article or
determiner, preposition, noun number, verb form,
and subject-verb agreement. Other error types
such as word choice errors (Dahlmeier and Ng,
2011a) were not dealt with.
In the CoNLL-2014 shared task, it was felt that
the community is now ready to deal with all er-
ror types. Table 1 shows examples of the 28 error
types in the CoNLL-2014 shared task.
Since there are 28 error types in our shared task
compared to two in HOO 2012 and five in CoNLL-
2013, there is a greater chance of encountering
multiple, interacting errors in a sentence in our
shared task. This increases the complexity of our
shared task. To illustrate, consider the following
sentence:
Social network plays a role in providing
and also filtering information.
The noun number error networks needs to be cor-
rected (network ? networks). This necessitates
the correction of a subject-verb agreement error
(plays ? play). A pipeline system in which cor-
rections for subject-verb agreement errors occur
strictly before corrections for noun number errors
would not be able to arrive at a fully corrected
sentence for this example. The ability to correct
multiple, interacting errors is thus necessary in our
shared task. The recent work of Dahlmeier and Ng
(2012a) and Wu and Ng (2013), for example, is
designed to deal with multiple, interacting errors.
3 Data
This section describes the training and test data
released to each participating team in our shared
task.
3.1 Training Data
The training data provided in our shared task is
the NUCLE corpus, the NUS Corpus of Learner
English (Dahlmeier et al., 2013). As noted by
(Leacock et al., 2010), the lack of a manually an-
notated and corrected corpus of English learner
texts has been an impediment to progress in gram-
matical error correction, since it prevents com-
parative evaluations on a common benchmark test
data set. NUCLE was created precisely to fill this
void. It is a collection of 1,414 essays written
by students at the National University of Singa-
pore (NUS) who are non-native speakers of En-
glish. The essays were written in response to some
prompts, and they cover a wide range of topics,
such as environmental pollution, health care, etc.
The grammatical errors in these essays have been
hand-corrected by professional English instructors
at NUS. For each grammatical error instance, the
start and end character offsets of the erroneous text
span are marked, and the error type and the cor-
rection string are provided. Manual annotation is
carried out using a graphical user interface specif-
ically built for this purpose. The error annotations
are saved as stand-off annotations, in SGML for-
mat.
To illustrate, consider the following sentence at
the start of the sixth paragraph of an essay:
Nothing is absolute right or wrong.
There is a word form error (absolute? absolutely)
in this sentence. The error annotation, also called
correction or edit, in SGML format is shown in
Figure 1. start par (end par) denotes the
paragraph ID of the start (end) of the erroneous

tion). start off (end off) denotes the char-
acter offset of the start (end) of the erroneous text
span (again, character offset starts from 0 by con-

The NUCLE corpus was first used in
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011b), and has been
publicly available for research purposes since
June 2011
1
. All instances of grammatical errors
are annotated in NUCLE.
To help participating teams in their prepara-
tion for the shared task, we also performed au-
tomatic preprocessing of the NUCLE corpus and
released the preprocessed form of NUCLE. The
preprocessing operations performed on the NU-
CLE essays include sentence segmentation and
word tokenization using the NLTK toolkit (Bird
et al., 2009), and part-of-speech (POS) tagging,
constituency and dependency tree parsing using
the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003;
de Marneffe et al., 2006). The error annotations,
which are originally at the character level, are
then mapped to error annotations at the word to-
ken level. Error annotations at the word token
level also facilitate scoring, as we will see in Sec-
tion 4, since our scorer operates by matching to-
kens. Note that although we released our own
preprocessed version of NUCLE, the participating
teams were however free to perform their own pre-
processing if they so preferred.
NUCLE release version 3.2 was used in the
CoNLL-2014 shared task. In this version, 17 es-
says were removed from the first release of NU-
CLE since these essays were duplicates with mul-
tiple annotations. In addition, in order to facilitate
the detection and correction of article/determiner
errors and preposition errors, we performed some
automatic mapping of error types in the original
NUCLE corpus to arrive at release version 3.2. Ng
et al. (2013) gives more details of how the map-
ping was carried out.
The statistics of the NUCLE corpus (release 3.2
version) are shown in Table 2. The distribution of
errors among all error types is shown in Table 3.
While the NUCLE corpus is provided in our
shared task, participating teams are free to not use
NUCLE, or to use additional resources and tools
in building their grammatical error correction sys-
tems, as long as these resources and tools are pub-

licly available and not proprietary. For example,
participating teams are free to use the Cambridge
FCE corpus (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011; Nicholls,
2003) (the training data provided in HOO 2012
(Dale et al., 2012)) as additional training data.
3.2 Test Data
Similar to CoNLL-2013, 25 NUS students, who
are non-native speakers of English, were recruited
to write new essays to be used as blind test data
in the shared task. Each student wrote two essays
in response to the two prompts shown in Table 4,
one essay per prompt. The first prompt was also
used in the NUCLE training data, but the second
prompt is entirely new and not used previously. As
a result, 50 new test essays were collected. The
statistics of the test essays are also shown in Ta-
ble 2.
Error annotation on the test essays was carried
out independently by two native speakers of En-
glish. One of them is a lecturer at the NUS Cen-
tre for English Language Communication, and the
other is a freelance English linguist with exten-
sive prior experience in error annotation of English
learners? essays. The distribution of errors in the
test essays among the error types is shown in Ta-
ble 3. The test essays were then preprocessed in
the same manner as the NUCLE corpus. The pre-
processed test essays were released to the partic-
ipating teams. Similar to CoNLL-2013, the test
essays and their error annotations in the CoNLL-
2014 shared task will be made freely available af-
ter the shared task.
4 Evaluation Metric and Scorer
A grammatical error correction system is evalu-
ated by how well its proposed corrections or edits
match the gold-standard edits. An essay is first
sentence-segmented and tokenized before evalua-
tion is carried out on the essay. To illustrate, con-
sider the following tokenized sentence S written
by an English learner:

<MISTAKE start par="5" start off="11" end par="5" end off="19">
<TYPE>Wform</TYPE>

ID Prompt
1 ?The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disor-
der. Once a test has been conducted and the results are known, however, a new, family-related
ethical dilemma is born: Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her
relatives?? Respond to the question above, supporting your argument with concrete examples.
2 While social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook can connect us closely to people in
many parts of the world, some argue that the reduction in face-to-face human contact affects
interpersonal skills. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your
daily life/society.
Table 4: The two prompts used for the test essays.
There is no a doubt , tracking system
has brought many benefits in this infor-
mation age .
The set of gold-standard edits of a human annota-
tor is g = {a doubt ? doubt, system ? systems,
has ? have}. Suppose the tokenized output sen-
tence H of a grammatical error correction system
given the above sentence is:
There is no doubt , tracking system has
brought many benefits in this informa-
tion age .
That is, the set of system edits is e = {a doubt
? doubt}. The performance of the grammatical
error correction system is measured by how well
the two sets g and e match, in the form of recall
R, precision P , and F
0.5
measure: R = 1/3, P =
1/1, F
0.5
= (1 + 0.5
2
)?RP/(R + 0.5
2
? P ) =
5/7.
More generally, given a set of n sentences,
where g
i
is the set of gold-standard edits for sen-
tence i, and e
i
is the set of system edits for sen-
tence i, recall, precision, and F
0.5
are defined as
follows:
R =

i=1

|g

|g

F
0.5
=
(1 + 0.5
2
)?R? P
R + 0.5

? P
(3)
where the intersection between g
i
and e
i
for sen-
tence i is defined as
g
i
? e
i
= {e ? e
i
|?g ? g
i
,match(g, e)} (4)
Note that we have adopted F
0.5
as the evaluation
metric in the CoNLL-2014 shared task instead of
the standard F
1
used in CoNLL-2013. F
0.5
em-
phasizes precision twice as much as recall, while
F
1
weighs precision and recall equally. When a
grammar checker is put into actual use, it is im-
portant that its proposed corrections are highly ac-
curate in order to gain user acceptance. Neglecting
to propose a correction is not as bad as proposing
an erroneous correction.
Similar to CoNLL-2013, we use the MaxMatch
(M
2
) scorer
2
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b) as the of-
ficial scorer in CoNLL-2014. The M
2
scorer
3
effi-
ciently searches for a set of system edits that max-
imally matches the set of gold-standard edits spec-
ified by an annotator. It overcomes a limitation of
the scorer used in HOO shared tasks, which can
return an erroneous score since the system edits
are computed deterministically by the HOO scorer
without regard to the gold-standard edits.
5 Approaches
45 teams registered to participate in the shared
task, out of which 13 teams submitted the out-
put of their grammatical error correction systems.
These teams are listed in Table 5. Each team is as-
signed a 3 to 4-letter team ID. In the remainder of
this paper, we will use the assigned team ID to re-
fer to a participating team. Every team submitted
a system description paper (the only exception is
the NARA team). Four of the 13 teams submitted
their system output only after the deadline (they
were given up to one week of extension). These
four teams (IITB, IPN, PKU, and UFC) have an
asterisk affixed after their team names in Table 5.
Each participating team in the CoNLL-2014
shared task tackled the error correction problem
in a different way. A full list summarizing each

team?s approach can be found in Table 6. While
machine-learnt classifiers for specific error types
proved popular in last year?s CoNLL-2013 shared
task, since this year?s task required the correction
of all 28 error types, teams tended to prefer meth-
ods that could deal with all error types simultane-
ously. In fact, most teams built hybrid systems that
made use of a combination of different approaches
to identify and correct errors.
One of the most popular approaches to non-
specific error type correction, incorporated to var-
ious extents in many teams? systems, was the Lan-
guage Model (LM) based approach. Specifically,
the probability of a learner n-gram is compared
with the probability of a candidate corrected n-
gram, and if the difference is greater than some
threshold, an error was perceived to have been de-
tected and a higher scoring replacement n-gram
could be suggested. Some teams used this ap-
proach only to detect errors, e.g., IPN (Hernandez
and Calvo, 2014), which could then be corrected
by other methods, whilst other teams used other
methods to detect errors first, and then made cor-
rections based on the alternative highest n-gram
probability score, e.g., RAC (Boros? et al., 2014).
No single team used a uniquely LM-based solution
and the LM approach was always a component in
a hybrid system.
An alternative solution to correcting all er-
rors was to use a phrase-based statistical machine
translation (MT) system to ?translate? learner En-
glish into correct English. Teams that followed the
MT approach mainly differed in terms of their at-
titude toward tuning; CAMB (Felice et al., 2014)
performed no tuning at all, IITB (Kunchukut-
tan et al., 2014) and UMC (Wang et al., 2014b)
tuned F
0.5
using MERT, while AMU (Junczys-
Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014) explored a va-
riety of tuning options, ultimately tuning F
0.5
us-
ing a combination of kb-MIRA and MERT. No
team used a syntax-based translation model, al-
though UMC did include POS tags and morphol-
ogy in a factored translation model.
With regard to correcting single error types,
rule-based (RB) approaches were also common in
most teams? systems. A possible reason for this
is that some error types are more regular than oth-
ers, and so in order to boost accuracy, simple rules
can be written to make sure that, for example, the
number of a subject agrees with the number of
a verb. In contrast, it is a lot harder to write a
rule to consistently correct Wci (wrong colloca-
tion/idiom) errors. As such, RB methods were of-
ten, but not always, used as a preliminary or sup-
plementary stage in a larger hybrid system.
Finally, although there were fewer machine-
learnt classifier (ML) approaches than last year,
some teams still used various classifiers to correct
specific error types. In fact, CUUI (Rozovskaya
et al., 2014) only built classifiers for specific er-
ror types and did not attempt to tackle the whole
range of errors. SJTU (Wang et al., 2014a) also
preprocessed the training data into more precise
error categories using rules (e.g., verb tense (Vt)
7
errors might be subcategorized into present, past,
or future tense etc.) and then built a single max-
imum entropy classifier to correct all error types.
See Table 6 to find out which teams tackled which
error types.
While every effort has been made to make clear
which team used which approach to correct which
set of error types, as there were more error types
than last year, it was sometimes impractical to fit
all this information into Table 6. For more infor-
mation on the specific methods used to correct a
specific error type, we must refer the reader to that
team?s CoNLL-2014 system description paper.
Table 6 also shows the linguistic features used
by the participating teams, which include lexical
features (i.e., words, collocations, n-grams), parts-
of-speech (POS), constituency parses, and depen-
dency parses.
While all teams in the shared task used the NU-
CLE corpus, they were also allowed to use addi-
tional external resources (both corpora and tools)
so long as they were publicly available and not
proprietary. Three teams also used last year?s
CoNLL-2013 test set as a development set in this
year?s CoNLL-2014 shared task. The external re-
sources used by the teams are also listed in Ta-
ble 6.
6 Results
All submitted system output was evaluated using
the M
2
scorer, based on the error annotations pro-
vided by our annotators. The recall (R), pre-
cision (P ), and F
0.5
measure of all teams are
shown in Table 7. The performance of the teams
varies greatly, from little more than five per cent to
37.33% for the top team.
The nature of grammatical error correction is
such that multiple, different corrections are of-
ten acceptable. In order to allow the participating
teams to raise their disagreement with the origi-
nal gold-standard annotations provided by the an-
notators, and not understate the performance of
the teams, we allow the teams to submit their
proposed alternative answers. This was also the
practice adopted in HOO 2011, HOO 2012, and
CoNLL-2013. Specifically, after the teams sub-
mitted their system output and the error annota-
tions on the test essays were released, we allowed
the teams to propose alternative answers (gold-
standard edits), to be submitted within four days
after the initial error annotations were released.

Table 7: Scores (in %) without alternative an-
swers. The teams that submitted their system out-
put after the deadline have an asterisk affixed after
their team names.
The same annotators who provided the error an-
notations on the test essays also judged the alter-
native answers proposed by the teams, to ensure
consistency. In all, three teams (CAMB, CUUI,
UMC) submitted alternative answers.
The same submitted system output was then
evaluated using the M
2
scorer, with the original
annotations augmented with the alternative an-
swers. Table 8 shows the recall (R), precision (P ),
and F
0.5
measure of all teams under this new eval-
uation setting.
The F
0.5
measure of every team improves when
evaluated with alternative answers. Not surpris-
ingly, the teams which submitted alternative an-
swers tend to show the greatest improvements in
their F
0.5
measure. Overall, the CUUI team (Ro-
zovskaya et al., 2014) achieves the best F
0.5
mea-
sure when evaluated with alternative answers, and
the CAMB team (Felice et al., 2014) achieves the
best F
0.5
measure when evaluated without alterna-
tive answers.
For future research which uses the test data of
the CoNLL-2014 shared task, we recommend that
evaluation be carried out in the setting that does
not use alternative answers, to ensure a fairer eval-
uation. This is because the scores of the teams
which submitted alternative answers tend to be
higher in a biased way when evaluated with alter-
native answers.
We are also interested in the analysis of the
system performance for each of the error types.

Table 8: Scores (in %) with alternative answers.
The teams that submitted their system output af-
ter the deadline have an asterisk affixed after their
team names.
Computing the recall of an error type is straight-
forward as the error type of each gold-standard
edit is provided. Conversely, computing the pre-
cision of each of the 28 error types is difficult as
the error type of each system edit is not available
since the submitted system output only contains
corrected sentences with no indication of the er-
ror type of the system edits. Predicting the error
type out of the 28 types for a particular system
edit not found in gold-standard annotation can be
tricky and error-prone. Therefore, we decided to
compute the per-type performance based on recall.
The recall scores when distinguished by error type
are shown in Tables 9 and 10.
6.1 Cross Annotator Comparison
To measure the agreement between our two an-
notators, we computed Cohen?s Kappa coefficient
(Cohen, 1960) for identification, which measures
the extent to which annotators agreed which words
needed correction and which did not, regardless
of the error type or correction. We obtained a
Kappa coefficient value of 0.43, indicating mod-
erate agreement (since it falls between 0.40 and
0.60). While this may seem low, it is worth point-
ing out that the Kappa coefficient does not take
into account the fact that there is often more than
one valid way to correct a sentence.
In addition to computing the performance of
each team against the gold standard annotations of
both annotators with and without alternative anno-
tations, we also had an opportunity to compare the
performance of each team?s system against each
annotator individually.
A recent concern is that there can be a high
degree of variability between individual annota-
tors which can dramatically affect a system?s out-
put score. For example, in a much simplified er-
ror correction task concerning only the correction
of prepositions, Tetreault and Chodorow (2008)
showed an actual difference of 10% precision and
5% recall between two annotators. Table 11 hence
shows the precision (P ), recall (R), and F
0.5
scores for all error types against the gold standard
annotations of each CoNLL-2014 annotator indi-
vidually.
The results show that there can indeed be a high
amount of disagreement between two annotators,
the most noticeable being precision in the UFC
system: precision was 70% for Annotator 2 but
only 28% for Annotator 1. This 42% difference is,
however, likely to be an extreme case, and most
teams show little more than 10% variation in pre-
cision and 5% variation in F
0.5
. Recall remained
fairly constant between annotators. 10% is still
a large margin however, and these results rein-
force the idea that error correction systems should
be judged against the gold-standard annotations of
multiple annotators.
Table 12 additionally shows how each annotator
compares against each other; i.e., what score An-
notator 1 gets if Annotator 2 was the gold standard
(part (a) of Table 12) and vice versa (part (b)).
The low F
0.5
scores of 45.36% and 38.54% rep-
resent an upper bound for system performance on
this data set and again emphasize the difficulty of
the task. The low human F
0.5
scores imply that
there are many ways to correct a sentence.
7 Conclusions
The CoNLL-2014 shared task saw the participa-
tion of 13 teams worldwide to evaluate their gram-
matical error correction systems on a common test
set, using a common evaluation metric and scorer.
The best systems in the shared task achieve an
F
0.5
score of 37.33% when it is scored without
alternative answers, and 45.57% with alternative
answers. There is still much room for improve-
ment in the accuracy of grammatical error correc-
tion systems. The evaluation data sets and scorer
used in our shared task serve as a benchmark for
