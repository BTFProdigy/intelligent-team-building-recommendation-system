Abstract
Arabic morphology is complex, partly be-
cause of its richness, and partly because
of common irregular word forms, such as
broken plurals (which resemble singular
nouns), and nouns with irregular gender
(feminine nouns that look masculine and
vice versa). In addition, Arabic morpho-
syntactic agreement interacts with the lex-
ical semantic feature of rationality, which
has no morphological realization. In this
paper, we present a series of experiments
on the automatic prediction of the latent
linguistic features of functional gender and
number, and rationality in Arabic. We com-
pare two techniques, using simple maxi-
mum likelihood (MLE) with back-off and
a support vector machine based sequence
tagger (Yamcha). We study a number of
orthographic, morphological and syntactic
learning features. Our results show that
the MLE technique is preferred for words
seen in the training data, while the Yam-
cha technique is optimal for unseen words,
which are our real target. Furthermore, we
show that for unseen words, morphological
features help beyond orthographic features
and that syntactic features help even more.
A combination of the two techniques im-
proves overall performance even further.
1 Introduction
Arabic morphology is complex, partly because
of its richness, and partly because of its com-
plex morpho-syntactic agreement rules which de-
pend on functional features not necessarily ex-
pressed in word forms. Particularly challeng-
ing are broken plurals (which resemble singu-
lar nouns), nouns with irregular gender (mascu-
line nouns that look feminine and feminine nouns
that look masculine), and the semantic feature
of rationality, which has no morphological re-
alization (Smr?, 2007b; Alkuhlani and Habash,
2011). These features heavily participate in Ara-
bic morpho-syntactic agreement. Alkuhlani and
Habash (2011) show that without proper model-
ing, Arabic agreement cannot be accounted for
in about a third of all noun-adjective pairs and
a quarter of verb-subject pairs. They also report
that over half of all plurals in Arabic are irregular,
8% of nominals have irregular gender and almost
half of all proper nouns and 5% of all nouns are
rational.
In this paper, we present results on the task
of automatic identification of functional gender,
number and rationality of Arabic words in con-
text. We consider two supervised learning tech-
niques: a simple maximum-likelihood model with
back-off (MLE) and a support-vector-machine-
based sequence tagger, Yamcha (Kudo and Mat-
sumoto, 2003). We consider a large number of
orthographic, morphological and syntactic learn-
ing features. Our results show that the MLE tech-
nique is preferred for words seen in the training
data, while the Yamcha technique is optimal for
unseen words, which are our real target. Further-
more, we show that for unseen words, morpho-
logical features help beyond orthographic features
and that syntactic features help even more. A
combination of the two techniques improves over-
all performance even further.
This paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tions 2 and 3 present relevant linguistic facts and
related work, respectively. Section 4 presents the
data collection we use and the metrics we target.
Section 5 discusses our approach. And Section 6
presents our results.

2 Linguistic Facts
Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. In
addition to being both templatic (root/pattern) and
concatenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic?s op-
tional diacritics add to the degree of word ambi-
guity. We focus on two problems of Arabic mor-
phology: the discrepancy between morphological
form and function; and the complexity of morpho-
syntactic agreement rules.
2.1 Form and Function
Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and
adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: mascu-
line (M ) and feminine (F ), and for number: sin-
gular (S), dual (D) and plural (P ). These features
are regularly expressed using a set of suffixes that
uniquely convey gender and number combina-
tions: +? (MS), ?+ +h?1 (FS), 	??+ +wn (MP ),
and H@+ +At (FP ). For example, the adjective
Q?A? mAhr ?clever? has the following forms among
others: Q?A? mAhr (MS), ?Q?A? mAhrh? (FS),
1Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-
Buckwalter (HSB) scheme (Habash et al 2007): (in alpha-
betical order) Abt?jHxd?rzs?SDT ?D??fqklmnhwy and the ad-
ditional symbols: ? Z, ? @, ?A @, ?A

@, w? ?', y? Z?', h? ?, ? ?.
	??Q?A? mAhrwn (MP ), and H@Q?A? mAhrAt
(FP ). For a sizable minority of words, these
features are expressed templatically, i.e., through
pattern change, coupled with some singular suf-
fix. A typical example of this phenomenon is the
class of broken plurals, which accounts for over
half of all plurals (Alkuhlani and Habash, 2011).
In such cases, the form of the morphology (sin-
gular suffix) is inconsistent with the word?s func-
tional number (plural). For example, the word
I. KA? kAtb (MS) ?writer? has the broken plural:
H. A
J? ktAb ( MSMP ).2 See the second word in the ex-
ample in Figure 1, which is the word H. A
J? ktAb
?writers? prefixed with the definite article Al+. In
addition to broken plurals, Arabic has words with
irregular gender, e.g., the feminine singular ad-
jective ?red? Z @Q?g HmrA? (MSFS ), and the nouns? 	?J
? 	g xlyfh? ( FSMS ) ?caliph? and ??Ag HAml (MSFS )
?pregnant?. Verbs and nominal duals do not dis-
play this discrepancy.
2.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement
Arabic gender and number features participate in
morpho-syntactic agreement within specific con-

structions such as nouns with their adjectives
and verbs with their subjects. Arabic agreement
rules are more complex than the simple match-
ing rules found in languages such as Spanish
(Holes, 2004; Habash, 2010). For instance, Ara-
bic adjectives agree with the nouns they mod-
ify in gender and number except for plural ir-
rational (non-human) nouns, which always take
feminine singular adjectives. Rationality (?hu-
manness? ???A? Q
 	?/??A??) is a morpho-lexical
feature that is narrower than animacy. English
expresses it mainly in pronouns (he/she vs. it)
and relativizers (men who... vs. cars/cows
which...). We follow the convention by Alkuh-
lani and Habash (2011) who specify rationality
as part of the functional features of the word.
The values of this feature are: rational (R), irra-
tional (I), and not-specified (N ). N is assigned to
verbs, adjectives, numbers and quantifiers.3 For
example, in Figure 1, the plural rational noun
H. A
J?? @ AlktAb ( MSMPR ) ?writers? takes the plural
adjective 	??JK

3 Related Work
Much work has been done on Arabic morpholog-
ical analysis, morphological disambiguation and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Al-Sughaiyer and
Al-Kharashi, 2004; Soudi et al 2007; Habash,
2010). The bulk of this work does not address
form-function discrepancy or morpho-syntactic
agreement issues. This includes the most com-
monly used resources and tools for Arabic NLP:
the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer
(BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) which is used in the
Penn Arabic Tree Bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al
2004), and the various POS tagging and morpho-
logical disambiguation tools trained using them
(Diab et al 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005).
There are some important exceptions (Goweder et
al., 2004; Habash, 2004; Smr?, 2007b; Elghamry
et al 2008; Abb?s et al 2004; Attia, 2008;
3We previously defined the rationality value N as not-
applicable when we only considered nominals (Alkuhlani
and Habash, 2011). In this work, we rename the rationality
value N as not-specified without changing its meaning. We
use the value Na (not-applicable) for parts-of-speech that
do not have a meaningful value for any feature, e.g., prepo-
sitions have gender, number and rationality values of Na.
Altantawy et al 2010; Alkuhlani and Habash,
2011).
In terms of resources, Smr? (2007b)?s work
contrasting illusory (form) features and functional
features inspired our distinction of morphologi-
cal form and function. However, unlike him, we
do not distinguish between sub-functional (logi-
cal and formal) features. His ElixirFM analyzer
(Smr?, 2007a) extends BAMA by including func-
tional number and some functional gender infor-
mation, but not rationality. This analyzer was
used as part of the annotation of the Prague Ara-
bic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smr? and Ha-
jic?, 2006). More recently, Alkuhlani and Habash
(2011) built on the work of Smr? (2007b) and ex-
tended beyond it to fully annotate functional gen-
der, number and rationality in the PATB part 3.
We use their resource to train and evaluate our
system.
In terms of techniques, Goweder et al(2004)
investigated several approaches using root and
pattern morphology for identifying broken plu-
rals in undiacritized Arabic text. Their effort re-
sulted in an improved stemming system for Ara-
bic information retrieval that collapses singulars
and plurals. They report results on identifying
broken plurals out of context. Similar to them,
we undertake the task of identifying broken plu-
rals; however, we also target the templatic gen-
der and rationality features, and we do this in-
context. Elghamry et al(2008) presented an auto-
matic cue-based algorithm that uses bilingual and
monolingual cues to build a web-extracted lexi-
con enriched with gender, number and rationality
features. Their automatic technique achieves an
F-score of 89.7% against a gold standard set. Un-
like them, we use a manually annotated corpus to
train and test the prediction of gender, number and
rationality features.
Our approach to identifying these features ex-
plores a large set of orthographic, morphological
and syntactic learning features. This is very much
following several previous efforts in Arabic NLP
in which different tagsets and morphological fea-
tures have been studied for a variety of purposes,
e.g., base phrase chunking (Diab, 2007) and de-
pendency parsing (Marton et al 2010). In this
paper we use the parser of Marton et al(2010)
as our source of syntactic learning features. We
follow their splits for training, development and
testing.

4 Problem Definition
Our goal is to predict the functional gender, num-
ber and rationality features for all words.
4.1 Corpus and Experimental Settings
We use the corpus of Alkuhlani and Habash
(2011), which is based on the PATB. The corpus
contains around 16.6K sentences and over 400K
tokens. We use the train/development/test splits
of Marton et al(2010). We train on a quarter of
the training set and classify words in sequence.
We only use a portion of the training data to in-
crease the percentage of words unseen in training.
We also compare to using all of the training data
in Section 6.7.
Our data is gold tokenized; however, all of
the features we use are predicted using MADA
(Habash and Rambow, 2005) following the work
of Marton et al(2010). Words whose tags are un-
known in the training set are excluded from the
evaluation, but not training. In terms of ambigu-
ity, the percentage of word types with ambiguous
gender, number and rationality in the train set is
1.35%, 0.79%, and 4.8% respectively. These per-
centages are consistent with how we perform on
these features, with number being the easiest and
rationality the hardest.
4.2 Metrics
We report all results in terms of token accuracy.
Evaluation is done for the following sets: all
words, seen words, and unseen words. A word is
considered seen if it is in the training data regard-
less of whether it appears with the same lemma
and POS tag or not. Defining seen words this way
makes the decision on whether a word is seen or
unseen unaffected by lemma and/or POS predic-
tion errors in the development and test sets. Us-
ing our definition of seen words, 34.3% of words
types (and 10.2% of word tokens) in the devel-
opment set have not been seen in quarter of the
training set.
We train single classifiers for G (gender), N
(number), R (rationality), GN and GNR, and eval-
uate them. We also combine the tags of the sin-
gle classifiers into larger tags (G+N, GN+R and
G+N+R).
5 Approach
Our approach involves using two techniques:
MLE with back-off and Yamcha. For each tech-
nique, we explore the effects of different learning
features and try to come up with the best tech-
nique and feature set for each target feature.
5.1 Learning Features
We investigate the contribution of different learn-
ing features in predicting functional gender, num-
ber and rationality features. The learning features
are explored in the following order:
Orthographic Features These features are or-
ganized in two sets: W1 is the unnormalized form
of the word, and W2 includes W1 plus letter n-
grams. The n-grams used are the first letter, first
two letters, last letter, and last two letters of the
word form. We tried using the Alif/Ya normalized
forms of the words (Habash, 2010), but these be-
haved consistently worse than the unnormalized
forms.
Morphological Features We explore the fol-
lowing morphological features inspired by the
work of Marton et al(2010):
? POS tags. We experiment with different POS
tag sets: CATiB-6 (6 tags) (Habash et al 2009),
CATiB-EX (44 tags), Kulick (34 tags) (Kulick et
al., 2006), Buckwalter (BW) (Buckwalter, 2004),
which is the tag used in the PATB (430 tags),
and a reduced form of BW tag that ignores case
and mood (BW-) (217 tags). These tags differ in
their granularity and range from very specific tags
(Buckwalter) to more general tags (CATiB).
? Lemma. We use the diacritized lemma
(Lemma), and the normalized and undiacritized
form of the lemma, the LMM (LMM).
? Form-based features. Form-based features
(F) are extracted from the word form and do not
necessarily reflect functional features. These fea-
tures are form-based gender, form-based number,
person and the definite article.
Syntactic Features We use the following syn-
tactic features (SYN) derived from the CATiB de-
pendency version of the PATB (Habash and Roth,
2009): parent, dependency relation, order of ap-
pearance (the word comes before or after its par-
ent), the distance between the word and its parent,
and the parent?s orthographic and morphological
features.
678
For all of these features, we train on gold val-
ues, but only experiment with predicted values in
the development and test sets. For predicting mor-
phological features, we use the MADA system
(Habash and Rambow, 2005). The MADA sys-
tem corrects for suboptimal orthographic choices
and effectively produces a consistent and unnor-
malized orthography. For the syntactic features,
we use Marton et al(2010)?s system.
5.2 Techniques
We describe below the two techniques we ex-
plored.
MLE with Back-off We implemented an MLE
system with multiple back-off modes using our
set of linguistic features. The order of the back-off
is from specific to general. We start with an MLE
system that uses only the word form, and backs
off to the most common feature value across all
words (excluding unknown and Na values). This
simple MLE system is used as a baseline.
As we add more features to the MLE system,
it tries to match all these features to predict the
value for a given word. If such a combination of
features is not seen in the training set, the sys-
tem backs off to a more general combination of
features. For example, if an MLE system is us-
ing the features W2+LMM+BW, the system tries
to match this combination. If it is not seen in
training, the system backs off to the following set:
LMM+BW, and tries to return the most common
value for this POS tag and lemma combination. If
again it fails to find a match, it backs off to BW,
and returns the most common value for that par-
ticular POS tag. If no word is seen with this POS
tag, the system returns the most common value
across all words.
Yamcha Sequence Tagger We use Yamcha
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003), a support-vector-
machine-based sequence tagger. We perform dif-
ferent experiments with the different sets of fea-
tures presented above. After that, we apply a
consistency filter that ensures that every word-
lemma-pos combination always gets the same
value for gender, number and rationality features.
Yamcha in its default settings tags words using a
window of two words before and two words af-
ter the word being tagged. This gives Yamcha an
advantage over the MLE system which tags each
word independently.
Single vs Joint Classification In this paper, we
only discuss systems trained for a single classifier
(for gender, for number and for rationality). In
experiments we have done, we found that training
single classifiers and combining their outcomes
almost always outperforms a single joint classi-
fier for the three target features. In other words,
combining the results of G and N (G+N) outper-
forms the results of the single classifier GN. The
same is also true for G+N+R, which outperforms
GNR and GN+R. Therefore, we only present the
results for the single classifiers G, N, R and their
combination G+N+R.
6 Results
We perform a series of experiments increasing in
feature complexity. We greedily select which fea-
tures to pass on to the next level of experiments.
In cases of ties, we pass the top two performers
to the next step. We discuss each of these exper-
iments next for both the MLE and Yamcha tech-
niques. Statistical significance is measured using
the McNemar test of statistical significance (Mc-
Nemar, 1947).
6.1 Experiment Set I: Orthographic
Features
The first set of experiments uses the orthographic
features. See Table 1. The MLE system with the
word only feature (W1) is effectively our base-
line. It does surprisingly well for seen cases. In
fact it is the highest performer across all exper-
iments in this paper for seen cases. For unseen
cases, it produces a miserable and expected low
score of 21.0% accuracy. The addition of the n-
gram features (W2) improves statistically signif-
icantly over W1 for unseen cases, but it is indis-
tinguishable for seen cases. The Yamcha system
shows the same difference in results between W1
and W2.
Across the two sets of features, the MLE sys-
tem consistently outperforms Yamcha in the case
of seen words, while Yamcha does better for un-
seen words. This can be explained by the fact that
the MLE system matches only on the word form
and if the word is unseen, it backs off to the most
common value across all words. Moreover, Yam-
cha uses some limited context information that al-
lows it to generalize for unseen words.
Among the target features, number is the easi-
est to predict, while rationality is the hardest.

(undiacritized lemma) and (iii) a variety of POS tag sets. For each subset, the best performers are bolded.
6.2 Experiment Set II: Morphological
Features
Individual Morphological Features In this set
of experiments, we use our best system from the
previous set, W2, and add individual morpholog-
ical features to it. We organize these features in
three sub-groups: (i) form-based features (F), (ii)
lemma and LMM, and (iii) the five POS tag sets.
See Table 2.
The F, Lemma and LMM improve over the
baseline in terms of unseen words for both MLE
and Yamcha techniques. However, for seen
words, these systems do worse than or equal to the
baseline when the MLE technique is used. The
MLE system in these cases tries to match the word
and its morphological features as a single unit and
if such a combination is not seen, it backs off to
the morphological feature which is more general.
Since we are using predicted data, prediction er-
rors could be the reason behind this decrease in
accuracy for seen words. Among these systems,
W2+F is the best for both Yamcha and MLE ex-
cept for rationality which is expected since there
are no form-based features for rationality. In this
set of experiments, Yamcha consistently outper-
forms MLE when it comes to unseen words, but
for seen words, MLE does better almost always.
LMM overall does better than Lemma. This is
reasonable given that LMM is easier to predict;
although LMM is more ambiguous.
As for the POS tag sets, looking at the MLE
results, CATIB-EX is the best performer for seen
words, and BW- is the best for unseen. CATIB-6
is a general POS tag set and since the MLE tech-
nique is very strict in its matching process (an ex-
act match or no match), using a general key to
match on adds a lot of ambiguity. With Yamcha,
BW and BW- are the best among all POS. Yamcha
is still doing consistently better in terms of unseen
words. The best two systems from both Yamcha
and MLE are used as the basic systems for the
next subset of experiments where we combine the
morphological features.
Combined Morphological Features Until this
point, all experiments using the two techniques
are similar. In this subset, MLE explores the ef-
fect of using the CATIB-EX and BW- with other
morphological features. And Yamcha explores
the effect of using BW- and BW with other mor-
phological features. See Table 3. Again, Yamcha
is still doing consistently better in terms of unseen
words, but when it comes to seen words, MLE
performs better. For seen words, our best results
come from MLE using CATIB-EX and LMM. For
unseen words, our best results come from Yam-
cha with the BW- tag and the form-based features

for both gender and number. For rationality, the
best features to use with Yamcha are BW, LMM
and form-based features. The lemma seems to ac-
tually hurt when predicting gender and number.
This can be explained by the fact that gender and
number features are often properties of the word
form and not of the lemma. This is different for
rationality, which is a property of the lemma and
therefore, we expect the lemma to help.
The fact that the predicted BW set helps is not
consistent with previous work by Marton et al
(2010). In that effort, BW helps parsing only in
the gold condition. BW prediction accuracy is
low because it includes case endings. We pos-
tulate that perhaps in our task, which is far more
limited than general parsing, errors in case pre-
diction may not matter too much. The more com-
plex tag set may actually help establish good lo-
cal agreement sequences (even if incorrect case-
wise), which is relevant to the target features.
6.3 Experiment Set III: Syntactic Features
This set of experiments adds syntactic features
to the experiments in set II. We add syntax to
the systems that uses Yamcha only since it is
not obvious how to add syntactic information to
the MLE system. Syntax improves the predic-
tion accuracy for unseen words but not for seen
words. In Yamcha, we can argue that the +/-2
word window allows some form of shallow syn-
tax modeling, which is why Yamcha is doing bet-
ter from the start. But the longer distance features
are helping even more, perhaps because they cap-
ture agreement relations. The overall best system
for unseen words is W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN,
except for number, where W2+BW-+F+SYN
is slightly better. In terms of G+N+R
scores, W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN is statistically
significantly better than all other systems in
this set for seen and unseen words, ex-
cept for unseen words with W2+BW+F+SYN.
W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN is also statistically sig-
nificantly better than its non-syntactic variant for
both seen and unseen words. The prediction ac-
curacy for seen words is still not as good as the
MLE systems.
6.4 System Combination
The simple MLE W1 system, which happens to be
the baseline, is the best predictor for seen words,
and the more advanced Yamcha system using syn-
tactic features is the best predictor for unseen
words. Next, we create a new system that takes
advantage of the two systems. We use the sim-
ple MLE W1 system for seen words, and Yam-
cha with syntax for unseen words. For unseen
681
words, since each target feature has its own set of
best learning features, we also build a combina-
tion system that uses the best systems for gender,
number and rationality and combine their output
into a single system for unseen words. For gender
and rationality, we use W2+BW+LMM+F+SYN,
and for number, we use W2+BW-+F+SYN. As
expected the combination system outperforms the
basic systems. For comparison: The MLE W1
system gets an (all, seen, unseen) scores of (89.3,
97.0, 21.0) for G+N+R, while the best single
Yamcha syntactic system gets (92.0, 93.8, 76.2);
the combination on the other hand gets (94.9,
97.0, 76.2). The overall (all) improvement over
the MLE baseline or the best Yamcha translates
into 52% error reduction or 36% error reduction,
respectively.
6.5 Error Analysis
We conducted an analysis of the errors in the out-
put of the combination system as well as the two
systems that contributed to it.
In the combination system, out of the total er-
ror in G+N+R (5.1%), 53% of the cases are for
seen words (3.0% of all seen) and 47% for unseen
words (23.8% of all unseen). Overall, rational-
ity errors are the biggest contributor to G+N+R
error at 73% relative, followed by gender (33%
relative) and number (26% relative). Among er-
ror cases of seen words, rationality errors soar to
87% relative, almost four times the corresponding
gender and number errors (27% and 22%, respec-
tively). However, among error cases of unseen
words, rationality errors are 57% relative, while
gender and number corresponding errors are (39%
and 31%, respectively). As expected, rational-
ity is much harder to tag than gender and number
due to its higher word-form ambiguity and depen-
dence on context.
We classified the type of errors in the MLE sys-
tem for seen words, which we use in the combi-
nation system. We found that 86% of the G+N+R
errors involve an ambiguity in the training data
where the correct answer was present but not cho-
sen. This is an expected limitation of the MLE ap-
proach. In the rest of the cases, the correct answer
was not actually present in the training data. The
proportion of ambiguity errors is almost identical
for gender, number and rationality. However ra-
tionality overall is the biggest cause of error, sim-
ply due to its higher degree of ambiguity.
All seen unseen
MLE W1 88.5 96.8 21.2
Yamcha BW+LMM+F 91.4 94.1 70.4
Yamcha BW+LMM+F+SYN 91.0 93.3 72.2
Combination 94.1 96.8 72.4
Table 5: Results on blind test. Scores for
All/Seen/Unseen are shown for the G+N+R condition.
We compare the MLE word baseline, with the best
Yamcha system with and without syntactic features
and the combined system.
Since the Yamcha system uses MADA features,
we investigated the effect of the correctness of
MADA features on the system prediction accu-
racy. The overall MADA accuracy in identifying
the lemma and the Buckwalter tag together ? a
very harsh measure ? is 77.0% (79.3% for seen
and 56.8% for unseen). Our error analysis shows
that when MADA is correct, the prediction ac-
curacy for G+N+R is 95.6%, 96.5% and 84.4%
for all, seen and unseen, respectively. However,
this accuracy goes down to 79.2%, 82.5% and
65.5% for all, seen and unseen, respectively, when
MADA is wrong. This suggests that the Yam-
cha system suffers when MADA makes wrong
choices and improving MADA would lead to im-
provement in the system?s performance.
6.6 Blind Test
Finally, we apply our baseline, best combination
model and best single Yamcha syntactic model
(with and without syntax) to the blind test set.
The results are in Table 5. The results in the blind
test are consistent with the development set. The
MLE baseline is best on seen words, Yamcha is
best on unseen words, syntactic features help in
handling unseen words, and overall combination
improves over all specific systems.
6.7 Additional Training Data
After experimenting on quarter of the train set to
optimize for various settings, we train our com-
bination system on the full train set and achieve
(96.0, 96.8, 74.9) for G+N+R (all, seen, unseen)
on the development set and (96.5, 96.8, 65.6)
on the blind test set. As expected, the overall
(all) scores are higher simply due to the addi-
tional training data. The results on seen and un-
seen words, which are redefined against the larger
training set, are not higher than results for the
quarter training data. Of course, these numbers
682
should not be compared directly. The number of
unseen word tokens in the full train set is 3.7%
compared to 10.2% in quarter of the train set.
6.8 Comparison with MADA
We compare our results with the form-based
features from the state-of-the-art morphological
analyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005).
We use the form-based gender and number fea-
tures produced by MADA after we filter MADA
choices by tokenization. Since MADA does not
give a rationality value, we assign the value I (ir-
rational) to nouns and proper nouns and the value
N (not-specified) to verbs and adjectives. Every-
thing else receives Na (not-applicable). The POS
tags are determined by MADA.
On the development set, MADA achieves
(72.6, 73.1, 58.6) for G+N+R (all, seen, unseen),
where the seen/unseen distinction is based on the
full training set in the previous section and is pro-
vided for comparison reasons only. The results for
the test set are (71.4, 72.2, 53.7). These results are
consistent with our expectation that MADA will
do badly on this task since it is not designed for
it (Alkuhlani and Habash, 2011). We should re-
mind the reader that MADA-derived features are
used as machine learning features in this paper,
where they actually help. In the future, we plan to
integrate this task inside of MADA.
6.9 Extrinsic Evaluation
We use the predicted gender, number and rational-
ity features that we get from training on the full
train set in a dependency syntactic parsing exper-
iment. The parsing feature set we use is the best
performing feature set described in (Marton et al
2011), which used an earlier unpublished version
of our MLE model. The parser we use is the Easy-
First Parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010). More
details on this parsing experiment is in Marton et
al. (2012).
The functional gender and number features in-
crease the labeled attachment score by 0.4% abso-
lute over a comparable model that uses the form-
based gender and number features. Rationality on
the other hand does not help much. One possible
reason for this is the lower quality of the predicted
rationality feature compared to the other features.
Another possible reason is that the rationality fea-
ture is not utilized optimally in the parser.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
We presented a series of experiments for auto-
matic prediction of the latent features of func-
tional gender and number, and rationality in Ara-
bic. We compared two techniques, a simple MLE
with back-off and an SVM-based sequence tag-
ger, Yamcha, using a number of orthographic,
morphological and syntactic features. Our con-
clusions are that for words seen in training, the
MLE model does best; for unseen word, Yamcha
does best; and most interestingly, we found that
syntactic features help the prediction for unseen
words.
In the future, we plan to explore training on pre-
dicted features instead of gold features to mini-
mize the effect of tagger errors. Furthermore, we
plan to use our tools to collect vocabulary not cov-
ered by commonly used morphological analyzers
and try to assign them correct functional features.
Finally, we would like to use our predictions for
gender, number and rationality as learning fea-
tures for relevant NLP applications such as senti-
ment analysis, phrase-based chunking and named
entity recognition.

Abstract
In this paper, we study the problem of auto-
matic enrichment of a morphologically under-
specified treebank for Arabic, a morpholog-
ically rich language. We show that we can
map from a tagset of size six to one with 485
tags at an accuracy rate of 94%-95%. We
can also identify the unspecified lemmas in
the treebank with an accuracy over 97%. Fur-
thermore, we demonstrate that using our au-
tomatic annotations improves the performance
of a state-of-the-art Arabic morphological tag-
ger. Our approach combines a variety of tech-
niques from corpus-based statistical models to
linguistic rules that target specific phenomena.
These results suggest that the cost of treebank-
ing can be reduced by designing underspec-
ified treebanks that can be subsequently en-
riched automatically.
1 Introduction
Collections of manually-annotated morphological
and syntactic analyses of sentences, or treebanks,
are an important resource for building statistical
parsing models or for syntax-aware approaches to
applications such as machine translation. Rich tree-
bank annotations have also been used for a variety
of natural language processing (NLP) applications
such as tokenization, diacritization, part-of-speech
(POS) tagging, morphological disambiguation, base
phrase chunking, and semantic role labeling.
The development of a treebank with rich annota-
tions is demanding in time and money, especially for
morphologically complex languages. Consequently,
the richer the annotation, the slower the annotation
process and the smaller the size of the treebank. As
such, a tradeoff is usually made between the size of
the treebank and the richness of its annotations.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility of
automatically enriching the morphologically un-
derspecified Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB)
(Habash and Roth, 2009; Habash et al, 2009) with
the more complex POS tags and lemmas used in
the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al,
2004). We employ a variety of techniques that range
from corpus-based statistical models to handwrit-
ten rules based on linguistic observations. Our best
method reaches accuracy rates of 94%-95% on full
POS tag identification. We can also identify the un-
specified lemmas in CATiB with an accuracy over
97%. 37% of our POS tag errors are due to gold tree
or gold POS errors. A learning curve experiment to
evaluate the dependence of our method on annotated
data shows that while the quality of some compo-
nents may reduce sharply with less data (12% abso-
lute reduction in accuracy when using 132 of the dataor some 10K annotated words), the overall effect is
a lot smaller (2% absolute drop). These results sug-
gest that the cost of treebanking can be reduced by
designing underspecified treebanks that can be sub-
sequently enriched automatically.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows:
Section 2 presents related work; Section 3 details
various language background facts about Arabic and
its treebanking; Section 4 explains our approach;
and Section 5 presents and discusses our results.
2 Related Work
Arabic Treebanking There has been a lot work
on building treebanks for different languages. In
the case of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), there
are three efforts that vary in terms of richness and
representation choice. The Penn Arabic Treebank
(PATB) (Maamouri et al, 2004; Maamouri et al,
2009b; Maamouri et al, 2009a), the Prague Ara-
bic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smr? and Ha-
jic?, 2006; Smr? et al, 2008) and the Columbia
Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Habash and Roth, 2009;
Habash et al, 2009) . The PATB uses phrase struc-
ture representation, while the other two use two
460
different dependency representations. The PATB
and PADT representations are quite detailed. The
PATB not only provides tokenization, complex POS
tags (485 tags in our data set), and syntactic struc-
ture; it also provides empty categories, diacritiza-
tion, lemma choices, glosses and some semantic
tags. In comparison CATiB only provides tokeniza-
tion, six POS tags and eight dependency relations.
The tradeoff is speed: CATiB?s complete POS and
syntax annotation rate is 540 tokens/hour (and an-
notator training takes two months), a much higher
speed than reported for complete (POS and syntax)
annotation in PATB (around 250-300 tokens/hour
and 6-12 months for annotator training) and PADT
(around 75 tokens/hour) (Habash and Roth, 2009).
An important recent addition to the family of Arabic
treebanks is the Quran Treebank, which targets the
Classical Arabic language of the Quran, not MSA
(Dukes and Buckwalter, 2010).
Treebank Enrichment There has been a number
of efforts on developing treebanks with rich rep-
resentations and on treebank enrichment for many
languages, such Danish, English, German, Italian
and Spanish (Oepen et al, 2002; Hinrichs et al,
2004; M?ller, 2010). Additionally, there has been
some work on Arabic treebank enrichment that built
on the PATB by manually extending its already
rich annotations or automatically converting them
to new formalisms. The Arabic Propbank (Proposi-
tional Bank) (Palmer et al, 2008) and the OntoNotes
project (Hovy et al, 2006) both annotate for Ara-
bic semantic information. Alkuhlani and Habash
(2011) add annotations marking functional gender
and number, and rationality; and Abdul-Mageed and
Diab (2012) annotate the sentence level with sen-
timent labels. Tounsi et al (2009) automatically
converted the PATB to a lexical functional gram-
mar (LFG) representation. Similarly, Habash and
Roth (2009) used a similar technique to build an
initial version of CATiB. We use this CATiB ver-
sion of PATB to evaluate our approach in this pa-
per. Also related to this is the work on automatic
enrichment of specific features, e.g., Habash et al
(2007a) demonstrated that nominal case, can be de-
termined for gold syntactic analyses at high accu-
racy. We replicate their results and improve upon
them. And unlike them, we handle all the morpho-
logical features in the PATB, not just case.
Morphological Disambiguation There has been
a lot of work on Arabic POS tagging and morpho-
logical disambiguation (Diab et al, 2004; Habash
and Rambow, 2005; Smith et al, 2005; Hajic? et al,
2005; Roth et al, 2008; Habash et al, 2013). These
approaches are intended to apply to raw text and
determine the appropriate in-context morphological
reading for each word. In contrast, in this paper,
we are starting from a partially disambiguated and
relatively rich representation: we have tokenization,
general POS tags and syntactic dependency infor-
mation.
Finally, morphological information (beyond tok-
enization) has been shown to be useful for many
NLP applications. Marton et al (2011) demon-
strated that morphology helps Arabic parsing. Us-
ing morphological features such as case has also
improved parsing for Russian, Turkish and Hindi
(Nivre et al, 2008; Eryigit et al, 2008; Nivre, 2009).
Other work has shown value for morphology in the
context of Arabic named entity recognition (Bena-
jiba et al, 2009). These results support the value of
our goal of enriching resources with morphological
information, which then can be used to improve dif-
ferent NLP applications.
3 Linguistic Background
In this section, we present some relevant general
linguistic facts about Arabic and then discuss the
specifics of the tagsets we work with in this paper.
Arabic Linguistic Facts The Arabic language
poses many challenges for NLP. Arabic is a mor-
phologically complex language which includes rich
inflectional and cliticizational morphology, e.g., the
word A? 	E?J. J?J
?? w+s+y-ktb-wn+hA1 ?and they will
write it? has two proclitics, one prefix, one suffix and
one pronominal enclitic. Additionally, Arabic has a
high degree of ambigiouty due to the absence of the
diacritics and inconsistent spelling of letters such as
Alif, @ ? and Ya ?
 y. The Buckwalter Arabic Mor-phological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004),
which is used in the PATB, produces an average of
12 analyses per word.
In this paper, we work with gold tokenized Ara-
bic as it appears in the PATB and CATiB treebanks.
1Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-
Buckwalter scheme (Habash et al, 2007b): (in alphabetical or-
der) Abt?jHxd?rzs?SDTD???fqklmnhwy and the additional sym-
bols: ? Z, ? @, A? @, A?
@, w? ?', y? Z?', h? ?, ? ?.
461
As such, the words are partially disambiguated with
regards to possible tokenizable clitics and Alif/Ya
spelling forms. That said, there is still a lot of am-
biguity remaining especially because diacritics are
not marked. Words in the treebank may be ambigu-
ous in terms of their POS, lemmas and inflectional
features. The inflectional features include gender,
number, person, case, state, mood, voice, aspect and
the presence of the determiner +?@ Al+ ?the?, which
is not tokenized off in the treebanks.
Arabic has a well known discrepancy in form and
function that appears most commonly in the form
of irregular plurals, called Broken Plurals, which
although functionally are plural, have singular suf-
fixes. We will not discuss form and function dis-
crepancy in this paper except as needed. For more
on this see Habash (2010).
The Buckwalter Tagset The Buckwalter POS
tagset is perhaps one of the most commonly used
tagsets for Arabic NLP research. The tagset?s pop-
ularity is in part due to its use in the PATB. Buck-
walter tags can be used for tokenized and untok-
enized text. The untokenized tags are produced by
BAMA (Buckwalter, 2004) and consist of 485 tags.
The tokenized tags, which are used in the PATB,
are derived from the untokenized tags and can reach
thousands of tags. Both variants use the same ba-
sic 70 or so sub-tag symbols (such as DET ?deter-
miner?, NSUFF ?nominal suffix?, ADJ ?adjective?
and ACC ?accusative?) (Maamouri et al, 2009a).
These sub-tags are combined to form around 170
morpheme tags such as NSUFF_FEM_SG ?femi-
nine singular nominal suffix? and CASE_DEF_ACC
?accusative definite?. The word tags are con-
structed out of one or more morpheme tags,
e.g. DET+NOUN_PROP+CASE_DEF_NOM for
the word 	?
??@ Al+Siyn+u ?China?.
CATiB Trees and POS Tags CATiB uses the
same basic tokenization scheme used by PATB and
PADT. However, the CATiB POS tagset is much
smaller. Whereas in practice PATB uses 485 Buck-
walter tags specifying every aspect of Arabic word
morphology such as definiteness, gender, number,
person, mood, voice and case, CATiB uses 6 POS
tags: NOM (non-proper nominals including nouns,
pronouns, adjectives and adverbs), PROP (proper
nouns), VRB (verbs), VRB-PASS (passive-voice
verbs), PRT (particles such as prepositions or con-

analyses as a constraint on the space from which wewill select the appropriate in context tag. The ap-proach is quite similar to how MADA (morphologi-cal analysis and disambiguation for Arabic) (Habashand Rambow, 2005) works except that we are usingthe CATiB tree as the context in which we disam-biguate. Given the degree of richness of the tree, weexpect to outperform basic disambiguation on text.In the rest of this section, we discuss our generalstrategy, followed by a detailed presentation of ourapproach: morphological disambiguation and mor-phological filtering.
4.1 From CATiB to Buckwalter: Devising aStrategy
In CATiB trees, different pieces of information canbe relevant to different disambiguation tasks. We an-alyzed the data we have and obtained the following
observations which we use to devise our strategy forhow to address different types of ambiguity:
? Words in CATiB treebank are tokenized. Thisresolves many ambiguous cases: analyses in-volving cliticized prepositions or conjunctionsare dismissed. Further more, separated cliticsare marked, which restricts their reading.
? The CATiB POS tag, although two orders ofmagnitude smaller than the Buckwalter tag set,provides a lot of information. It resolves ambi-guity amongst verbs (active or passive), nomi-nals, particles, proper nouns and punctuation.
? The CATiB tags NOM or PRT are the most am-biguous. They are challenging because thereare both lexical and morphosyntactic featuresat play. We rely on our training data to learnmodels of how to disambiguate them.

Abstract
We present an enriched version of the Penn
Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al, 2004),
where latent features necessary for model-
ing morpho-syntactic agreement in Arabic are
manually annotated. We describe our pro-
cess for efficient annotation, and present the
first quantitative analysis of Arabic morpho-
syntactic phenomena.
1 Introduction
Arabic morphology is complex, partly because of its
richness, and partly because of its complex morpho-
syntactic agreement rules which depend on features
not necessarily expressed in word forms, such as
lexical rationality and functional gender and num-
ber. In this paper, we present an enriched ver-
sion of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB, part 3)
(Maamouri et al, 2004) that we manually anno-
tated for these features.1 We describe a process
for how to do the annotation efficiently; and fur-
thermore, present the first quantitative analysis of
morpho-syntactic phenomena in Arabic.
This resource is important for building computa-
tional models of Arabic morphology and syntax that
account for morpho-syntactic agreement patterns. It
has already been used to demonstrate added value
for Arabic dependency parsing (Marton et al, 2011).
This paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tions 2 and 3 present relevant linguistic facts and
related work, respectively. Section 4 describes our
annotation process and Section 5 presents an analy-
sis of the annotated corpus.
1The annotations are publicly available for research pur-
poses. Please contact authors. The PATB must be acquired
through the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC): http://
www.ldc.upenn.edu/.
2 Linguistic Facts
Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. In addi-
tion to being both templatic (root/pattern) and con-
catenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic?s optional
diacritics add to the degree of word ambiguity
(Habash, 2010). This paper focuses on two specific
issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal
morphology involving the features of gender and
number only: the discrepancy between morpholog-
ical form and function and the complex system of
morpho-syntactic agreement.
2.1 Form and Function
Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and
adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: mascu-
line (M ) and feminine (F ), and for number: sin-
gular (S), dual (D) and plural (P ). These fea-
tures are typically realized using a small set of
suffixes that uniquely convey gender and num-
ber combinations: +? (MS),

?+ +h?2 (FS),
	
?@+ +An (MD), 	?AK+ +tAn (FD), 	??+ +wn (MP ),
and H@+ +At (FP ).3 For example, the adjective
Q?A? mAhr ?clever? has the following forms among
others: Q?A? mAhr (MS),

?Q?A? mAhrh? (FS), 	??Q?A?
mAhrwn (MP ), and H@Q?A? mAhrAt (FP ). For a
sizable minority of words, these features are ex-
pressed templatically, i.e., through pattern change,
coupled with some singular suffix. A typical ex-
ample of this phenomenon is the class of broken
2Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-
Buckwalter (HSB) scheme (Habash et al, 2007): (in alphabeti-
cal order) Abt?jHxd?rzs?SDTD???fqklmnhwy and the additional
symbols: ? Z, ?

@, A? @, A?

@, w? ?', y? Z?', h?

?, ? ?.
3Some suffixes have case/state varying forms, e.g.,
	
??+ +wn appears as 	?K
+ +yn (accusative/genitive case) and
?+ +w (nominative construct state).
357
plurals. In such cases, the form of the morphol-
ogy (singular suffix) is inconsistent with the word?s
functional number (plural). For example, the word
I.

KA? kAtb (MS) ?writer/scribe? has two broken plu-
rals: H. A

J? ktAb (MSMP )
4 and

?J.

J? ktbh? ( FSMP ). In ad-
dition to broken plurals, Arabic has a class of bro-
ken feminines in which the feminine singular form
is derived templatically: e.g., the adjective ?red?
Q?g

@ ?Hmr (MSMS ) and Z @Q?
g HmrA? (MSFS ). Verbs and
nominal duals do not display this discrepancy. Ad
hoc cases of form-function discrepancy also exist,
e.g.,

?
	
?J
?
	
g xlyfh? ( FSMS ) ?caliph?, ??Ag HAml (
MS
FS )
?pregnant?, and

?K
Q? Tryq ?road? which can be
both M and F (MSBS ). Arabic also has some non-
countable collective plurals that behave as singulars
morpho-syntactically although they may translate to
English as plurals, e.g., Q?

? tmr (MSMS ) ?palm dates?.
2.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement
Arabic gender and number features participate in
morpho-syntactic agreement within specific con-
structions such as nouns and their adjectives and
verbs and their subjects. Arabic agreement rules are
more complex than the simple matching rules found
in languages such as French or Spanish (Holes,
2004; Habash, 2010).
First, Arabic adjectives agree with the nouns
they modify in gender and number except for plu-
ral irrational (non-human) nouns, which always
take feminine singular adjectives. For example,
the two plural words HAJ. ? A? TAlbAt (
FP
FPR )
5 ?stu-
dents? and HAJ.

J?? mktbAt ?libraries? ( FPFPI ) take
the adjective ?new? as H@YK
Yg. jdydAt (
FP
FPN )
and

?YK
Yg. jdydh? (
FS
FSN ), respectively. Ra-
tionality is a morpho-lexical feature. There are
nouns that are semantically rational/human but not
morpho-syntactically, e.g., H. ??
? ??wb ( MSMPI ) ?na-
tions/peoples? takes a feminine singular adjective.6
Second, verbs and their nominal subjects have the
same rules as nouns and their adjectives, except that,
4This nomenclature denotes ( FormFunction ).
5We specify rationality as part of the functional features of
the word. The values of this feature are: rational (R), irra-
tional (I), and not-applicable (N ). N is assigned to verbs, ad-
jectives, numbers and quantifiers.
6Rationality (?humanness? ??

?A? Q

	
?/?

?A??) is narrower
than animacy. English expresses it mainly in pronouns (he/she
vs. it) and relativizers (men who... vs. cars/cows which...).

based and functional morphology features ( FormFunction ).

additionally, verbs in verb-subject (VSO) order only
agree in gender and default to singular number. For
example, the sentence ?the men traveled? can appear
as @?Q
	
?A? ?Ag. Q? @ AlrjAl (
MS
MPR ) sAfrwA (
MP
MPN ) or as
?Ag. Q? @ Q
	
?A? sAfr ( MSMSN ) AlrjAl (
MS
MPR ).
Third, number quantification has unique rules
(Dada, 2007), e.g., numbers over 10 always take a
singular noun, while numbers 3 to 10 take a plu-
ral noun and inversely agree with the noun?s func-
tional gender.7 Compare, for instance, HAJ. ? A? ??
	
g
xms ( MSMSN ) TAlbAt (
FP
FPR ) ?five [female] students?
with H. C?


g xmsh? ( FSFSN ) TlAb (
MS
MPR ) ?five
[male] students? and

?J. ? A?
	
????
	
g xmswn ( MPBPN )
TAlbh? ( FSFSR ) ?lit. fifty [female] student[s]?. Fig-
ure 1 presents one example that combines the three
phenomena mentioned above. The example is in a
dependency representation based on the Columbia
Arabic Treebank (CATIB) (Habash and Roth, 2009).
Finally, although the rules described above are
generally followed, there are numerous exceptions
that can typically be explained as some form of fig-
ure of speech involving elision or overridden ratio-
nality/irrationality. For example, the word ?
k. jy?
( MSMSI ) ?army? can take the rational MP agreement
in an elided reference to its members.
7Reverse gender agreement can be modeled as a form-
function discrepancy, although it is typically not discussed as
such in Arabic grammar.

3 Related Work
Much work has been done on Arabic computa-
tional morphology (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi,
2004; Soudi et al, 2007; Habash, 2010). How-
ever, the bulk of this work does not address form-
function discrepancy or morpho-syntactic agree-
ment issues. This is unfortunately the case in some
of the most commonly used resources for Arabic
NLP: the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Ana-
lyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) and the Penn
Arabic Tree Bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al, 2004).
There are some important exceptions (Goweder et
al., 2004; Smr?, 2007b; Elghamry et al, 2008; Ab-
b?s et al, 2004; Attia, 2008; Altantawy et al, 2010).
We focus on comparing with two of these due to
space restrictions.
Smr? (2007b)?s work contrasting illusory (form)
features and functional features inspired our distinc-
tion of morphological form and function. How-
ever, unlike him, we do not distinguish between
sub-functional (logical and formal) features. His
ElixirFM analyzer (Smr?, 2007a) extends BAMA
by including functional number and some functional
gender information, but not rationality. This ana-
lyzer was used as part of the annotation of the Prague
Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smr? and
Hajic?, 2006). In the work presented here, we an-
notate for all three features completely in the PATB
and we present a quantitative analysis of morpho-
syntactic agreement patterns in it.
Elghamry et al (2008) presented an automatic
cue-based algorithm that uses bilingual and mono-
lingual cues to build a web-extracted lexicon en-
riched with gender, number and rationality features.
Their automatic technique achieves an F-score of
89.7% against a gold standard set. Unlike them,
we annotate the PATB manually exploiting existing
PATB information to help annotate efficiently and
accurately.
4 Corpus Annotation
4.1 The Corpus
We annotated the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) part
3 (Maamouri et al, 2004) for functional gender,
number and rationality. The corpus contains around
16.6K sentences and over 400K tokens.8 All PATB
8All clitics are separated from words in the PATB except for
the definite article +?@ Al+.
tokens are already diacritized and lemma/part-of-
speech (POS) disambiguated manually. Since verbs
are regular in their form-to-function mapping, we
annotate them automatically. Nominals account for
almost half of all tokens (? 197K tokens). The
unique diacritized nominal types are almost 52K
corresponding to 15,720 unique lemmas.
4.2 Annotation Simplification
To simplify the annotation task, we made the follow-
ing decisions. First, we decided to annotate nomi-
nals out of context except for the use of their lem-
mas and POS tags, which were already assigned
manually in context in the PATB. The intuition here
being that the functional features we are after are
not contextually variable. We are consciously ig-
noring usage in figures-of-speech. Second, we nor-
malized the case/state-variant forms of the num-
ber/gender suffixes and removed the definite arti-
cle proclitic. The decision to normalize is condi-
tioned on the manually annotated PATB POS tag.
The normalized forms preserve the most important
information for our task: the stem of the word and
the number/gender suffix. These two decisions al-
low us exploit the PATB POS and lemma annota-
tions to reduce the number of annotation decisions
from 197K tokens and their lemmas to 21,148 mor-
phologically normalized forms and 15,720 lemmas
? an order of magnitude less decisions to make,
which made the task more feasible both in terms of
money and time. Of all nouns, adjectives and proper
nouns, around 4.6% (tokens) and 27.2% (types) have
no lemmas (annotated as DEFAULT, TBupdate, or
nolemma). These cases make our out-of-context an-
notation very hard. We do not currently address
this issue. A smaller set of closed class words (778
types corresponding to 35,675 tokens), e.g. pro-
nouns and quantifiers, were annotated manually sep-
arately. The annotation speed averaged about 675
(words/lemmas) per hour.
4.3 Annotation Guidelines
We summarize the annotation guidelines here due to
space restrictions. Full guidelines will be presented
in a future publication. The core annotation task in-
volves assigning the correct functional gender, num-
ber and rationality to nominals. Gender can be M ,
F , B (both), or U (unknown). Number can be S, D,
359
P , or U . And rationality can be R, I , B,9 N or
U . The annotators were given word clusters each
of which consisting of a lemma and all of its sim-
plified inflected forms appearing in the PATB. We
also provided the POS and English gloss. Annota-
tors were asked to assign the rationality feature to
the lemma only; and the gender and number features
to the inflected forms. Default form-based gender
and number are provided. As for rationality, adjec-
tives receive a default N and everything else gets
I . The guidelines explained the form-function dis-
crepancy problem, and the various morpho-syntactic
agreement rules (Section 2) were given as tests to
allow the annotators to make correct decisions. The
issue figures-of-speech is highlighted as a challenge
and annotators are asked to think of different con-
texts for the word in question.
4.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement
We computed inter-annotator agreement (IAA) over
a random set of 397 lemma clusters with 509 word
types corresponding to 4,781 tokens. The type-
based IAA scores for words with known lemmas are
93.7%, 99.0% and 89.6% for gender, number and
rationality respectively. The corresponding token-
based IAA scores are 94.5%, 99.7% and 95.1%. The
respective Kappa values (Cohen, 1960) for types are
0.87, 0.97, 0.82 and for tokens 0.89, 0.99, 0.92.
Based on these scores, the number features is the
easiest to annotate, followed by gender and ratio-
nality. This is explainable by the fact that num-
ber in Arabic is always expressed morphologically
through affix or stem change, while gender is more
lexical, and rationality is completely lexical. The
corresponding IAA scores for all words (including
words with unknown lemmas) drop to 86.8%, 94.9%
and 82.9% (for types) and 93.5%, 99.2% and 94.0%
(for tokens). The respective Kappa values for types
are 0.74, 0.85, 0.73 and for tokens 0.87, 0.97, 0.90
The difference caused by missing lemmas highlights
the need and value for complete annotations in the
PATB. The overall high scores for IAA suggest that
the task is not particularly hard for humans to per-
form, and that disambiguating information is cru-
cial. Points of disagreement will be addressed in
future extensions of the guidelines.
9The rationality value B is used for cases with lemma am-
biguity, e.g., 	??J?J
? hyltwn ?Hilton? can refer to the hotel chain
or a member of the Hilton family.
5 Corpus Analysis
We present a quantitative analysis of the annotated
corpus focusing on the issues that motivated it.
5.1 Form-Function Similarity Patterns
Table 1 summarizes the different combinations of
form-function values of gender, number and ratio-
nality for nominals in our corpus. In terms of gen-
der, the M value seems to be twice as common as
F both in form and function. In 91.4% of all nomi-
nals, function and form agree. Adjectives show the
most agreement (98.8%) followed by nouns (92.5%)
and then proper nouns (74.6%). As for number, S
is the dominant value in form (91.8%) and func-
tion (83.1%). Broken plurals ( SP ) are almost 55%
of all plurals. 99.5% of proper nouns are singular,
which means that rationality is effectively irrelevant
for proper nouns as a feature, since it is only rel-
evant morpho-syntactically with plurals. Although
the great majority of nouns are irrational, proper
nouns tend to be almost equally split between ra-
tional and irrational. In terms of gender and number
(jointly), 85% of all nominals have matching form
and function values, with adjective having the high-
est ratio, followed by nouns and then proper nouns.
5.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement Patterns
We focus on three agreement classes: Noun-
Adj(ective), Verb-Subject (VSO and SVO orders)
and Number-Noun (multiple configurations). We
only consider structural bigrams in the CATIB
(Habash and Roth, 2009) dependency version of the
training portion of the PATB (part 3) used by Mar-
ton et al (2011). See Figure 1 for an example. The
total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost
11.6% of all bigrams. Over two-thirds are Noun-
Adj, and around a quarter are Verb-Subject. For
each agreement class, we compare using a simple
agreement rule (parent and child values match) with
using an implementation of the complex agreement
rules summarized in Section 2. We also compare

Table 2 presents the percentage of bigrams we de-
termine to agree (i.e. be grammatical) under dif-
ferent features and rules. Overall, simple (equality)
10Simple agreement between parent and child in gender
alone is 83.2% (form) and 86.0% (function). The corresponding
agreement for number is 82.0% (form) and 72.5% (function).
The drop in the last number is due to broken plurals.

Table 1: Form-function discrepancy in nominals. All the
numbers are percentages. Numbers in the first row are
percentage of all nominals. Numbers in each column
associated with a particular feature (or feature combi-
nation) and a particular POS are the percentage of oc-
currences within the POS. The second column specifies
(Form/Function) values. =/= signifies complete match.
form-based gender and number agreement between
parent and child is only 66.7%. Using functional
values, the simple gender and number agreement
moves only to 68.5%. Introducing complex agree-
ment rules with form-based values (using the default
N value for rationality of adjectives and I for other
classes) increases grammaticality scores to 80.3%
overall. However, with using both functional mor-
phology features and complex agreement rules, the
grammaticality score jumps to 93.6% overall. These
results validate the need for both functional features
and complex agreement rules in Arabic.
5.3 Manual Analysis of Agreement Problems
The cases we considered ungrammatical when ap-
plying complex agreement rules with functional fea-
tures above add up to 2,540 instances. Out of these,
we took a random sample of 423 cases and analyzed
it manually. About 50% of all problems are the re-
sult of human annotation errors. Almost two-thirds
of these errors involve incorrect rationality assign-
ment and almost one-third involved incorrect gen-
der. Incorrect number assignment occurs around
5% of the time. Treebank errors (as in POS or
tree structure) are responsible for 20% of all agree-

ment problems. Structure and POS tags are almost
equal in their contribution. The rest of the agree-
ment problems (?30%) are the result of special rules
or figures-of-speech that are not handled. Figures
of speech account for about 7% of all error cases
(or less than 0.5% of all nominals). The most com-
mon cases of unhandled rules include not modeling
conjunctions, which affect number agreement, fol-
lowed by gender-number invariable forms of some
adjectives. After this error analysis, we identi-
fied 379 lemmas involved in incorrect rationality-
affected agreement (as per our rules). All of these
cases had a PI features but did not agreed as FS.
Out of these lemmas, 204 were corrected manually
as R. The functional agreement with rules jumped
from 93.6% to 95.7% (a 33% error reduction).
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We presented a large resource enriched with latent
features necessary for modeling morpho-syntactic
agreement in Arabic. In future work, we plan to use
both corpus annotations and agreement rules to auto-
matically learn functional features for unseen words
and detect and correct annotation errors. We also
plan to extend agreement rules to include complex
structures beyond bigrams.
