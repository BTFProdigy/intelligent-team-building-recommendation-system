Abstract 
In this paper we describe some preliminary 
results of qualitative evaluation of the answer-
ing system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive 
Question Answering) which has been devel-
oped over the last 2 years as an advanced re-
search tool for information analysts. HITIQA 
is an interactive open-domain question an-
swering technology designed to allow analysts 
to pose complex exploratory questions in natu-
ral language and obtain relevant information 
units to prepare their briefing reports in order 
to satisfy a given scenario. The system uses 
novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clari-
fication dialogue with the user that explores 
the scope and the context of the desired answer 
space. The system has undergone extensive 
hands-on evaluations by a group of intelli-
gence analysts representing various foreign in-
telligence services. This evaluation validated 
the overall approach in HITIQA but also ex-
posed limitations of the current prototype.  
1   Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as ?What 
has been Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kos-
ovo?? The distinguishing property of such questions is 
that one cannot generally anticipate what might consti-
tute the answer. While certain types of things may be 
expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is 
heavily conditioned by what information is in fact avail-
able on the topic, background knowledge of the user, 
context in the scenario, intended audience, etc. From a 
practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often un-
derspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of pos-
sible answers. Therefore, clarification dialogue is often 
needed to negotiate with the user the exact scope and 
intent of the question, and clarify whether similar topics 
found might also be of interest to the user in order to 
complete their scenario report. This paper will present 
results from a series of evaluations conducted in a series 
of workshops with the intended end users of HITIQA 
(professional intelligence analysts) using the system to 
solve realistic analytic problems. 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in the 
state of the art of automated question answering.  In this 
paper we focus on our approach to analytical question 
answering in order to produce a report in response to a 
given scenario.  We also report on the user evaluations 
we conducted and their results with respect to our 
unique approach. 
2   Analytical QA Scenarios 
Analytical scenarios are information task directives 
assigned to analysts to support a larger foreign policy 
process. Scenarios thus contain the information need 
specifications at various levels of detail,  the type, for-
mat and timing of the response required (an intelligence 
report) as well as the primary recipient of the report 
(e.g., the Secretary of State). A hypothetical, but realis-
tic scenario is shown in Figure 1 below. This scenario, 
along with several others like it, was used in evaluating 
 HITIQA performance and fitness for supporting the 
analytical process.  
As can be readily assessed from the directives in 
Figure 1, scenarios are not merely tough questions; they 
are far too complex to be considered as a single question 
at all. It is equally clear that no simple answer can be 
expected and that preparing a report would mean find-
ing answers to a series of interlocking questions or vari-
ous granularities.  
 
Scenario: The al-Qaida Terrorist Group 
 
As an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, your pro-
fession entails knowledge of the al-Qaida terrorist group.  
Your division chief has ordered a detailed report on the al-
Qaida Terrorist Group due in three weeks. Provide as much 
information as possible on this militant organization. Eventu-
ally, this report should present information regarding the most 
essential concerns, including who are the key figures involved 
with al-Qaida along with other organizations, countries, and 
members that are affiliated, any trades that al-Qaida has made 
with organizations or countries, what facilities they possess, 
where they receive their financial support, what capabilities 
they have (CBW program, other weapons, etc.) and how have 
they acquired them, what is their possible future activity, how 
their training program operates, who their new members are. 
Also, include any other relevant information to your report as 
you see fit.  
 FIGURE 1: Scenario used during user evaluations 
  
We have organized a series of usability evaluations 
with active duty intelligence analysts to find out how 
they approach the problem of solving a scenario. The 
prerequisites for this were are follows: 
1. A robust, broadly functional analytical QA sys-
tem capable of sustaining realistic analytic 
tasks. 
2. A realistic corpus of ?raw intelligence? in form 
of varying quality and verity new-like reports. 
3. A set of realistic, average complexity analytic 
tasks or scenarios to be used. 
HITIQA has been developed over the past two years as 
an open-ended highly flexible interactive QA system to 
allow just this type of evaluation. The system supports a 
variety of information gathering functions without 
straight jacketing the user into any particular mode or 
interaction style. The system does not produce cut and 
dry ?answers?; instead it allows the analysts to build the 
answers the way they want them. While this open-
endedness may seem like unfinished business, we be-
lieve that further development must take into account 
the needs of analysts if they were ever to adopt this 
technology in their work. 
Our main hypothesis is that analysts employ a range 
of strategies to find the required information and that 
these strategies depend significantly upon the nature of 
the task and the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. Our experience with interactive systems also indi-
cated that real users are unlikely to follow any single 
information exploration strategy, but instead would use 
multiple, parallel, even overlapping approaches in order 
to maximize the returns and their confidence in the re-
sults. As a corollary we may expect that the scenario 
tasks are unlikely to be systematically decomposed into 
a series of smaller tasks ahead of actual search. In other 
words, the analytical process is a dialogue, not a se-
quence of commands. Moreover, questions actually 
submitted to the system during the analytical process 
seldom seek just the exact answer, instead they are often 
considered as ?light beams? through the data: focusing 
on the answer but also illuminating adjacent, related 
information which may prove just as valuable.  
AFRL, NIST, CNS and ARDA collaborated in the 
development of scenarios used in our evaluation ses-
sions.  
3   Data Driven Semantics of Questions 
When the user poses a question to a system having 
access to a huge database of unstructured data (text 
files), we need to first reduce the big pile to perhaps a 
handful of documents where the answer is likely to be 
found. The easiest way to do it is to convert the question 
into a search query (by removing stopwords and stem-
ming and tokenizing other words) and submitting this 
query to a fast but non-exact document retrieval system, 
e.g.,   Smart (Buckley, 1985) or InQuery (Callan et al, 
1992), or if you are on the web, Google, etc.   
In the current prototype of HITIQA, we use a com-
bination of Google and InQuery to retrieve the top 50 to 
200 documents from a large document database, con-
sisting of several smaller collections such as newspaper 
stories, documents from the Center of Nonproliferation 
Studies, as well as web mined files.  The retrieved 
documents are then broken down into passages, mostly 
exploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of 
the original sources. 
The set of text passages returned from the initial 
search is the first (very crude) approximation of the An-
swer Space for the user?s first question. In order to de-
termine what this answer space consists of we perform 
automatic analysis (a combination of hierarchical clus-
tering and classification) to uncover if what we got is a 
fairly homogenous collection (i.e., all texts have very 
similar content), or whether there are a number of di-
verse topics or aspects represented in there, somehow 
tied together by a common thread. In the former case, 
we may be reasonably confident that we have the an-
swer, modulo the retrievable information. In the latter 
case, we know that the question is more complex than 
the user may have intended, and a negotiation process is 
needed to clarify topics of interest for the scenario re-
port. 
 The next step is to measure how well each of the as-
pects within the answer space is ?matching up? against 
the original question. This is accomplished through the 
framing process described later in this paper. The out-
come of the framing process is twofold: first, the alter-
native interpretations of the question are ranked within 3 
broad categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers. 
Second, salient concepts and attributes for each topi-
cal/aspectual group are extracted into topic frames. This 
enables the system to conduct a meaningful dialogue 
with the user, a dialogue which is wholly content ori-
ented, and entirely data driven.  
4   Partial structuring of text data 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to de-
lineate the gap between the meaning of the user?s ques-
tion and the system ?understanding? of this question. 
The framing is an attempt to impose a partial structure 
on the text that would allow the system to systemati-
cally compare different text pieces against each other 
and against the question, and also to communicate with 
the user about this. In particular, the framing process 
may uncover topics or aspects within the answer space 
which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus 
may be unaware of their existence.  This approach is 
particularly beneficial to the needs of the scenario prob-
lem, where these similar aspects frequently are needed 
in completely ?answering? the scenario, with the sce-
nario report.   
In the current version of HITIQA, frames are pre-
defined structures representing various event types. We 
started with the General frame, which can represent any 
event or relation involving any number of entities such 
as people, locations, organizations, time, and so forth.  
In a specialized domain, or if the user interests are 
known to be limited to a particular set of topics, we de-
fine domain-specific frames. Current HITIQA prototype 
has three broad domain-specific frames, related to the 
Weapon of Mass Destruction proliferation domain 
(which was one of the domains of interest to our users). 
These frames are: WMDTransfer, WMDDevelop, 
WMDTreaty, and of course we keep the General frame.  
Obviously, these three frames do not cover the domain 
represented by our data set; they merely capture the 
most commonly occurring types of events. All frames 
contain a small number of core attributes, such as LO-
CATION, PERSON, COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, ETC., which 
are extracted using BBN?s Identifinder software, which 
extracts 24 types of entities.  Domain-specific frames 
add event specific attributes, which may require extract-
ing additional items from text, or assigning roles to ex-
isting attributes, or both.  For example, WMDTransfer?s 
attributes TRANSFER_TO and TRANSFER_FROM define 
roles of some COUNTRY or ORGANIZATION, while the 
TRANSFER_TYPE attribute scans the text for keywords 
that may indicate the type of transfer, e.g., export, sale, 
etc.  
HITIQA creates a Goal frame for the user?s ques-
tion, which can be subsequently compared to the data 
frames obtained from retrieved data. A Goal frame can 
be a General frame or any of the domain specific frames 
available in HITIQA.  For example, the Goal frame 
generated from the question, ?Where does al-Qaida 
have training facilities?? is a General frame as shown in 
Figure 2.  This was the first question generated by one 
of our analysts during the first evaluation while working 
on the al-Qaida scenario shown in Figure 1.

RELEVANCE:  Conflict: [Topic] 
FIGURE 3: A HITIQA generated data frame and the un-
derlying text passage. Words in bold were used to fill the 
Frame.   
 
HTIQA automatically judges a particular data frame 
as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding seg-
ment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal 
frame. The data frames are scored based on the number 
of conflicts found between them and the Goal frame. 
The conflicts are mismatches on values of correspond-
ing attributes. If a data frame is found to have no con-
flicts, it is given the highest relevance rank, and a con-
flict score of zero.  All other data frames are scored with 
 a decreasing value based on the number of conflicts, 
negative one for frames with one conflict with the Goal 
frame, negative two for two conflicts etc.  Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the question are 
given a score of -99 indicating the lowest relevancy 
rank.  Currently, frames with a conflict score of -99 are 
excluded from further processing as outliers. The frame 
in Figure 2 is scored as a near miss and will generate 
dialogue, where the user will decide whether or not it 
should be included in the answer space. 
5   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space. Depending upon the pres-
ence of other frames outside of this set, the system ei-
ther proceeds to generate the answer or initiates a dia-
logue with the user.  HITIQA begins asking the user 
questions on these near-miss frame groups, with the 
largest group first.  The groups must be at least groups 
of size N, where N is a user controlled setting.  This 
setting restricts all of HITIQA?s generated dialogue.   
A one conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal frame. This could be a mis-
match on any of the General attributes, for example, 
LOCATION, or ORGANIZATION, or TIME, etc., or in one of 
the domain specific attributes, TRANSFER_TO, or TRANS-
FER_TYPE, etc.  A special case arises when the conflict 
occurs on the TOPIC attribute.  Since all other attributes 
match, we may be looking at potentially different events 
or situations involving the same entities, or occurring at 
the same location or time. The purpose of the clarifica-
tion dialogue in this case is to probe which of these top-
ics may be of interest to the user.  Another special case 
arises when the Goal frame is of a different type than a 
data frame.  The purpose of the clarification dialogue in 
this case is to expand the user?s answer space into a 
different but possibly related event.  A combination of 
both of these cases is illustrated in the exchange in Fig-
ure 4 below.   
User: ?Where does al-Qaida have training facili-
ties?? 
HITIQA: ?Do you want to see material on the trans-
fer of weapons and intelligence to al-Qaida?? 
FIGURE 4: Dialogue generated by HITIQA for the al-Qaida 
training facilities question 
 
In order to understand what happened here, we need 
to note first that the Goal frame for this example is a 
General Frame, from Figure 2.  One of the data frames 
that caused this dialogue to be generated is shown in 
Figure 3 above.  While this frame is of a different frame 
type than the Goal frame, namely WMD Transfer, it 
matches on all of the General attributes except TOPIC, so 
HITIQA asks the user if they would like to expand their 
answer space to this other domain, namely to include 
the transfer of weapons involving this organization as 
well.

FIGURE 5: Partial answer generated by HITIQA to the al-
Qaida training facilities question 
 
During the dialogue, as new information is obtained 
from the user, the Goal frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated. The system may 
interpret the new information as a positive or negative. 
Positives are added to the Goal frame. Negatives are 
stored in a Negative-Goal frame and will also be used in 
the re-scoring of the data frames, possibly causing con-
flict scores to increase. If the user responds the equiva-
lent of ?yes? to the system clarification question in Fig-
ure 4, a corresponding WMD Transfer frame would be 
added to the Goal frame and all WMD Transfer frames 
will be re-scored.  If the user responds ?no?, the Nega-
tive-Goal frame will be generated and all WMD Trans-
fer frames will be rescored to 99 in order to remove 
them from further processing.  The user may end the 
dialogue, at any point and have an answer generated 
given the current state of the frames.   
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text 
passages from the zero conflict frames. In addition, 
HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for the text passages 
in all the Frames in the answer space.  This is done us-
ing grammar rules and the attributes of a frame.  Figure 
 5 shows a portion of the answer generated by HITIQA 
for the al-Qaida training facilities question. 
 
6   HITIQA Interface 
There are two distinct ways for the user to interact 
with HITIQA to explore their answer space.  The An-
swer Panel displays the user?s current answer at any 
given time during the interaction for a single question.  
Through this panel the user can read the paragraphs that 
are currently in their answer.  There are links on this 
panel so the user is able to view the full original source 
document from which the passage(s) were extracted. 
 The Visual panel offers the user an alternative to 
reading text by providing a tool for visually browsing 
the entire answer space.  Figure 6 shows a typical view 
of the visualization panel. The spheres are representa-
tive of single frames and groups of frames.  The user?s 
attention may be drawn to particular frames by the color 
coding or the attribute spikes.  The colors represent the 
frame?s score, so the user can quickly see what is in 
their answer, blue, and what is not, all other colors.  The 
attribute spikes may also be used as a navigation tool.  
The active attribute is chosen by the user through radio 
buttons. The current active attribute in Figure 6, is Lo-
cation.  This displays all instances of locations men-
tioned in the corresponding text. 
 
 
        Figure 6: Frame Level Display 
 
The underlying text that was used to build the frame 
may be displayed in the lower right hand window.  In 
this text display window there is a hyperlink that takes 
the user directly to the full source document. The user is 
able to interact with this panel by adding and removing 
information from their generated answer. Moving from 
the visualization to the textual dialogue, the generated 
answer, and back is seamless in a sense that any 
changes to the frame scores in one modality are imme-
diately accessible to the user in another modality. Users 
can add and remove frames from the answer space and 
HITIQA will always seamlessly pickup a new dialogue 
or generate a new answer.  
 
7   HITIQA Qualitative Evaluations 
In order to assess our progress thus far, and to also 
develop metrics to guide future evaluation, we invited a 
group of analysts employed by the US government to 
participate in two three-day workshops held in Septem-
ber and October 2003.  
The two basic objectives of the workshops were: 
1. To perform a realistic assessment of the useful-
ness and usability of HITIQA as an end-to-end system, 
from the information seeker's initial questions to com-
pletion of a draft report.  
2. To develop metrics to compare the answers ob-
tained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of 
the support that HITIQA provides.     
Each of these objectives entails a particular chal-
lenge. Performing a realistic assessment of HITIQA is 
difficult because many of the resources that the analysts 
use, as well as the reports they produce, are classified 
and therefore inaccessible to researchers.  
Assessing the quality of the support that the system 
provides is not easy because analytical questions rarely 
have a single right answer. It is not obvious how to de-
fine, for example, the precision of the system. We there-
fore conducted an 'information unit' exercise, whose 
purpose was to determine whether the analysts could 
identify information building blocks in their reports, so 
that we could compare and contrast different reports.  
To obtain an adequate supply of appropriate text 
data to support extensive question answering sessions 
(1, 2, 3 and 4 hours long), we prepared a new corpus of 
approximately 1.2 Gbytes. This new corpus consists of 
the reports from the Center for Non-Proliferation Stud-
ies (CNS) collected for the AQUAINT Program, aug-
mented with a much larger collection of texts on similar 
subject matter mined from the web using Google1. The 
final corpus proved to be sufficient to support about 
three hours of use of HITIQA to ?solve? each of the 
scenarios. 
The first day of the first workshop was devoted to 
training, including a two-part proficiency test. HITIQA 
is a fairly complex system, that includes multiple layers 
of data processing and user interaction, and it was criti-
cal that the users are sufficiently ?fluent? if we were to 
measure their productivity. The analysts' primary task 
on the second day was preparation of reports in re-
sponse to the scenarios. 
                                                 
1 Google has kindly agreed to temporarily extend our 
usage license so we could collect the data over a short 
time. 
  The third day was devoted to quantitative and quali-
tative evaluation, discussed later. In addition, we asked 
the analysts to score each others reports, as well as to 
identify key information units in them. These informa-
tion units could be later compared across different re-
ports in order to determine their completeness.  
8   Workshop Results 
The results of the quantitative evaluations strongly vali-
date the approach that we have taken. These conclusions 
are confirmed by analysts comments gleaned both from 
the formal qualitative assessment and from informal 
discussion. As one analyst said, ?the system as it stands 
now, in my mind, gave me enough information to try to 
put together a 80% solution but ?I don't think you're 
ever gonna reach that 100% state.? At the same time, we 
learned a great deal about how analysts work. 
It is important to determine the realism of the sce-
narios used during the workshop relative to the analysts? 
current work tasks in order for any results to be mean-
ingful. Each analyst was asked a series of five questions 
such as, ?How realistic was the scenario?  In other 
words did it resemble tasks you could imagine perform-
ing at work?? These 5 questions were all relative to the 
realism and difficulty of the scenario tasks.  Analysts 
used a scale of 1 to 5 based on their agreement with the 
statements, where 5 was complete agreement.  Our 
mean score was 3.84, indicating our scenarios were real-
istic and of about average difficulty when compared to 
the work they normally perform.   
We have classified the type of passages that an ana-
lyst copied to their report into two categories, answer 
passages and additional information passages, see Fig-
ure 7 below.  The answer passages either exactly an-
swered the user?s initial question or supplied supporting 
information.  The additional passages do not answer the 
original question posed, but may have been added to the 
answer through dialogue, or through the user?s explora-
tion of document links offered.  This could be a piece of 
information needed to satisfy some other aspect of the 
scenario that they had not asked about yet, or possibly a 
topic the user had not even considered but found rele-
vant when it was presented to them. As can be seen 
there was a very large amount of ?additional? informa-
tion that the user copied to their report.  The amounts 
reported here are the averages for all of the analysts for 
both workshops.  This supports our hypothesis that ana-
lysts seldom seek just the exact answer, but they are 
also looking at adjacent, related information, much of 
which they retain for their report.  Note that there were a 
small number of passages that contained a combination 
of answer and additional information; these were added 
to answer.

Figure 8: Number of Passages Copied Vs. Those Viewed 
 
We should now establish the number of passages 
copied versus those viewed, relative to links and the 
answer.  Figure 8 above shows the total number of pas-
sages copied versus the total number of passages 
viewed.  It is seen that many more passages need to be 
viewed through full document links before a useful pas-
sage is found.  In comparison a much smaller number of 
answer passages need to be viewed from the Answer 
panel in order to find useful passages.   
All of the analysts? sessions were recorded using 
Camtasia.  Figure 9 shows an annotation created for a 
typical session.  Analysts were observed to utilize a 
range of varying strategies as they worked different 
scenarios and even while working different queries of 
the same scenario.  Figure 10 shows the statistics for 
each Analyst?s use of HITIQA while working on the 
scenarios during the two workshops (note that Analyst-4 
was only able to attend the first workshop and Analyst-1 
did not create a report for Scenario 2).  Some of the 
variations in strategies among the analysts while work-
ing the same scenario are quite striking.  For example, 
Scenario 4 was  worked quite  differently  by  Analyst-1  
 versus Analyst-2.  While Analyst-1 spent almost all of 
his/her  time in  the Visual Panel, Analyst-2 spent virtu-
ally all of his/her time in the Answer panel.  Analyst-1 
produced his/her report copying 52 paragraphs while 
Analyst 2 copied only 35.  There are also large varia-
tions in the number of questions asked for the same sce-
nario.  Examine scenario 5, where Analyst-3 asked a 
total of 11 questions and Analyst-2 only needed to ask 2 
questions.  Relative to this, Analyst-3, who asked a 
much larger number of questions, copied only 28 pas-
sages, whereas Analyst-2 copied 31.  These variations, 
as stated earlier in the paper, could be due to the nature 
of the task, the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. For example, the difference in the number of 
questions asked between Analyst-2 and Analyst-3 for 
scenario 5 may be due to difference in search strategies 
employed, but may also reflect the amount of back-
ground knowledge of the topic.

There is, however, some consistency across the ana-
lysts in the amount of information retained per scenario. 
The charts are drawn in logarithmic scale, but it should 
be visible that scenarios 2 and 3 produced less interac-
tion and required less information to fulfill than scenar-
ios 4 and 5. It is also visible that scenario 1 required 
more questions to be asked and more exploration to be 
done in visual panel than other scenarios. 
Finally, it is important to provide some metric re-
garding the user?s overall satisfaction with their use of 
HITIQA.  At the end of each workshop Analysts were 
given a series of 17 questions, such as ?HITIQA helps 
me find important information?, shown in Figure 11, to 
assess their overall experience with the system.  Many 
of these questions were designed for the user to com-
pare HITIQA to the current tools they are using for this 
type of task.   Analysts again used a scale of 1 to 5 
based on their agreement with the statements.  The re-
sults were then converted, where 5 would always denote 
the best, and are shown in Figure 11 below.  It is impor-
tant to note that we scored highly overall, but addition-
ally we scored highly in the majority of questions rela-
tive to comparison of their current tools.  For example, 
for Question 14: ?Having HITIQA at work would help 
me find information faster than I can currently find it?, 
our mean score was 3.83.

In summary, the results from these two evaluations 
indicate that HITIQA, in its current state, is already 
competitive with the tools that the analysts are currently 
using in their work, supporting our overall approach to 
Analytical Question Answering.  HTIQA provides the 
user with a tool to find the passages needed to complete 
a report for a given scenario.  While working on a sce-
nario HITIQA has been shown to provide information 
which exactly answers the user?s question, and addi-
tionally HITIQA?s method brings to light other related 
information that the analyst retains in order to complete 
their report.

This article describes our novel approach to the automated detection and analysis of meta-phors in text. We employ robust, quantitative language processing to implement a system prototype combined with sound social science methods for validation. We show results in 4 different languages and discuss how our methods are a significant step forward from previously established techniques of metaphor identification. We use Topical Structure and Tracking, an Imageability score, and innova-tive methods to build an effective metaphor identification system that is fully automated and performs well over baseline.  1 Introduction The goal of this research is to automatically identi-fy metaphors in textual data.  We have developed a prototype system that can identify metaphors in naturally occurring text and analyze their seman-tics, including the associated affect and force. Met-aphors are mapping systems that allow the semantics of a familiar Source domain to be ap-plied to a Target domain so that new frameworks of reasoning can emerge in the Target domain. Metaphors are pervasive in discourse, used to con-vey meanings indirectly. Thus, they provide criti-cal insights into the preconceptions, assumptions and motivations underlying discourse, especially valuable when studied across cultures. When met-aphors are thoroughly understood within the con-text of a culture, we gain substantial knowledge about cultural values. These insights can help bet-ter shape cross-cultural understanding and facili-
tate discussions and negotiations among different communities.  A longstanding challenge, however, is the large-scale, automated identification of metaphor in vol-umes of data, and especially the interpretation of their complex, underlying semantics.  We propose a data-driven computational ap-proach that can be summarized as follows: Given textual input, we first identify any sentence that contains references to Target concepts in a given Target Domain (Target concepts are elements that belong to a particular domain; for instance ?gov-ernment bureaucracy? is a Target concept in the ?Governance? domain). We then extract a passage of length 2N+1, where N is the number of sentenc-es preceding (or succeeding) the sentence with Target Concept. We employ dependency parsing to determine the syntactic structure of each input sen-tence. Topical structure and imageability analysis are then combined with dependency parsing output to locate the candidate metaphorical expressions within a sentence. For this step, we identify nouns and verbs in the passage (of length 2N+1) and link their occurrences ? including repetitions, pronomi-nal references, synonyms and hyponyms. This linking uncovers the topical structure that holds the narrative together.  We then locate content words that are outside the topical structure and compute their imageability scores. Any nouns or adjectives outside the main topical structure that also have high imageability scores and are dependency-linked in the parse structure to the Target Concept are identified as candidate source relations, i.e., expressions borrowed from a Source domain to describe the Target concept. In addition, any verbs that have a direct dependency on the Target Con-
67
cept are considered as candidate relations. These candidate relations are then used to compute and rank proto-sources. We search for their arguments in a balanced corpus, assumed to represent stand-ard use of the language, and cluster the results. Proto-source clusters and their ranks are exploited to determine whether the candidate relations are metaphorical or literal. Finally, we compute the affect and force associated with the metaphor.    Our approach is shown to work in four lan-guages ? American English, Mexican Spanish, Russian Russian and Iranian Farsi. We detail in this paper the application of our approach to detec-tion of metaphors using specific examples from the ?Governance? domain. However, our approach can be expanded to work on extracting metaphors in any domain, even unspecified ones. We shall brief-ly explain this in Section 5; we defer the details of the expanded version of the algorithm to a separate larger publication. In addition, we shall primarily present examples in English to illustrate details of our algorithms. However, modules for all four lan-guages have the same implementation in our sys-tem.  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we discuss related research in this field. Section 3 presents our approach in detail; Section 4 describes our evaluation and results. In Section 5 we discuss our conclusions and future directions.  2 Related Work Most current research on metaphor falls into three groups: (1) theoretical linguistic approaches (as defined by Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; and their fol-lowers) that generally look at metaphors as abstract language constructs with complex semantic prop-erties; (2) quantitative linguistic approaches (e.g., Charteris-Black, 2002; O?Halloran, 2007) that at-tempt to correlate metaphor semantics with their usage in naturally occurring text but generally lack robust tools to do so; and (3) social science ap-proaches, particularly in psychology and anthro-pology that seek to explain how people deploy and understand metaphors in interaction, but which lack the necessary computational tools to work with anything other than relatively isolated exam-ples.     Metaphor study in yet other disciplines has in-cluded cognitive psychologists (e.g., Allbritton, McKoon & Gerrig, 1995) who have focused on the 
way metaphors may signify structures in human memory and human language processing. Cultural anthropologists, such as Malkki in her work on refugees (1992), see metaphor as a tool to help out-siders interpret the feelings and mindsets of the groups they study, an approach also reflective of available metaphor case studies, often with a Polit-ical Science underpinning (Musolff, 2008; Lakoff, 2001).      In computational investigations of metaphor, knowledge-based approaches include MetaBank (Martin, 1994), a large knowledge base of meta-phors empirically collected. Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) use WordNet (Felbaum, 1998) knowledge to differentiate between metaphors and literal usage. Such approaches entail the existence of lexical resources that may not always be present or satisfactorily robust in different languages. Gedigan et al(2006) identify a system that can recognize metaphor. However their approach is only shown to work in a narrow domain (Wall Street Journal, for example).     Computational approaches to metaphor (largely AI research) to date have yielded only limited scale, often hand designed systems (Wilks, 1975; Fass, 1991; Martin, 1994; Carbonell, 1980; Feld-man & Narayan, 2004; Shutova & Teufel, 2010; inter alia, also Shutova, 2010b for an overview). Baumer et al(2010) used semantic role labels and typed dependency parsing in an attempt towards computational metaphor identification. However they self-report their work to be an initial explora-tion and hence, inconclusive. Shutova et al(2010a) employ an unsupervised method of metaphor iden-tification using nouns and verb clustering to auto-matically impute metaphoricity in a large corpus using an annotated training corpus of metaphors as seeds. Their method relies on annotated training data, which is difficult to produce in large quanti-ties and may not be easily generated in different languages.  By contrast, we propose an approach that is fully automated and can be validated using empirical social science methods. Details of our algorithm follow next.  3 Our Approach In this section, we walk through the steps of meta-phor identification in detail. Our overall algorithm 
68
consists of five main steps from obtaining textual input to classification of input as metaphorical or literal.  3.1 Passage Identification The input to our prototype system is a piece of text. This text may be taken from any genre ? news articles, blogs, magazines, official announcements, broadcast transcripts etc.  Given the text, we first identify sentences that contain Target concepts in the domain we are in-terested in. Target concepts are certain keywords that occur within the given domain and represent concepts that may be targets of metaphor. For in-stance, in the ?Governance? domain, concepts such as ?federal bureaucracy? and ?state mandates? serve as Target concepts. We keep a list of Target concepts to search through when analyzing given input. This list can be automatically created by mining Target Concepts from resource such as Wikipedia, given the Target domain, or manually constructed. Space limits the discussion of how such lists may be automatically created; a separate larger publication addresses our approach to this task in greater detail.  In Figure 1, we show a piece of text drawn from a 2008 news article. The sentence in italics con-tains one of our Target concepts: ?federal bureau-cracy?. We extract the sentence containing Target concepts that match any of those in our list, includ-ing N sentences before and N sentences after the sentence if they exist, to yield a passage of at most 2N+1 sentences. For the example shown in Figure 1, the Target concept is ?federal bureaucracy?. In current system prototype, N=2. Hence, we extract two sentences prior to the sentence containing ?federal bureaucracy? (in Figure 1 example, these are omitted for ease of presentation) and two sen-tences following the given sentence.       Once this passage is extracted, we need to de-termine whether a metaphor is present in the mid-dle sentence. To accomplish that, we follow the steps as described in the next section.    
 Figure 1. Excerpt from news article. Passage containing target concept highlighted in italics. The callouts 1, 2 etc., indicate topic chains (see next section).      3.2 Topical Structure and Imageability Anal-ysis Our hypothesis is that metaphorically used terms are typically found outside the topical structure of the text. This is an entirely novel method of effec-tively selecting candidate relations. It draws on  Broadwell et al (2012), who proposed a method to establish the topic chains in discourse as a means of modeling associated socio-linguistic phenomena such as topic control and discourse cohesiveness. We adapted this method to identify and exclude any words that serve to structure the core discus-sion, since the metaphorical words, except in the cases of extended and highly elaborated meta-phors, are not the main subject, and thus unlikely to be repeated or referenced in the context sur-rounding the sentence.  We link the occurrences of each noun and verb in the passage (5 sentence length). Repetitions via synonyms, hyponyms, lexical variants and pronoun references are linked together. These words, as elements of the several topic chains in a text, are then excluded from further consideration. WordNet (Felbaum, 1998) is used to look up synonyms and hyponyms of the remaining content words. We 
These qualities1 have helped him4 navigate the labyrinthine federal bureaucracy in his demand-ing $191,300-a-year job as the top federal offi-cial3 responsible for bolstering airline, border2, port and rail security against a second cata-strophic terrorist attack.  But those same personal qualities1 also explain why the 55-year-old Cabinet officer3 has alienat-ed so many Texans along the U.S.-Mexico bor-der2 with his4 relentless implementation of the Bush administration's hard-nosed approach to immigration enforcement - led by his unyielding push to construct 670 miles of border2 fencing by the end of the year.  Some Texas officials are so exasperated that they say they'll just await the arrival of the next presi-dent before revisiting border enforcement with the federal government.  Copyright 2008.

illustrate this in Figure 1. We show the two sen-tences that form the latter context in the example passage. We show four of the topic chains discov-ered in this passage. These have been labeled via superscripts in Figure 1. 1 and 2 are the repetitions of word ?qualities? and ?border?. The 3 identifies repetition via lexical variants ?officer? and ?offi-cial? and 4 identifies the pronoun co-references  ?him? and ?his?. We shall exclude these words from consideration when searching for candidate metaphorical relations in the middle sentence of the passage.  To further narrow the pool of candidate relations in this sentence, we compute the imageability scores of the remaining words. The hypothesis is metaphors use highly imageable words to convey their meaning. The use of imageability scores for the primary purpose of metaphor detection distin-guishes our approach from other research on this problem. While Turney et al (2011) explored the use of word concreteness (a concept related but not identical to imageability) in an attempt to disam-biguate between abstract and concrete verb senses, their method was not specifically applied to detec-tion of metaphors; rather it was used to classify verb senses for the purpose of resolving textual entailment. Broadwell et al (2013) present a de-tailed description of our approach and how we use imageability scores to detect metaphors. Our assertion is that any highly imageable word is more likely to be a metaphorical relation. We use the MRCPD (Coltheart 1981, Wilson 1988) expanded lexicon to look up the imageability scores of words not excluded via the topic chains. Although the MRCPD contains data for over 150,000 words, a major limitation of the database for our purposes is that the MRCPD has imageabil-ity ratings (i.e., how easily and quickly the word evokes a mental image) for only ~9,240  (6%) of the total words in its database. To fill this gap, we expanded the MRCPD database by adding imagery ratings for an further 59,989 words. This was done by taking the words for which the MRCPD data-base has an imageability rating and using that word as an index to synsets determined using WordNet (Miller, 1995). The expansion and validation of the expanded MRCPD imageability rating is presented in a separate, future publication.  Words that have an imageability rating lower than an experimentally determined threshold are further excluded from consideration. In the exam-
ple shown in Figure 1, words that have sufficiently high imageability scores are ?labyrinthine?, ?port?, ?rail? and ?airline?. We shall consider them as candidate relations, to be further investigated, as explained in the dependency parsing step described next.   3.3 Relation Extraction Dependency parsing reveals the syntactic structure of the sentence with the Target concept. We use the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) for English language data. We identify candidate met-aphorical relations to be any verbs that have the Target concept in direct dependency path (other than auxiliary and modal verbs). We exclude verbs of attitude (?think?, ?say?, ?consider?), since these have been found to be more indicative of metony-my than of metaphor. This list of attitude verbs is automatically derived from WordNet. From the example shown in Figure 1, one of the candidate relations extracted would be the verb ?navigate?.      In addition, we have a list of candidate relations from Step 3.2, which are the highly imageable nouns and adjectives that remain after topical structure analysis. Since ?port?, ?rail? and ?airline? do not have a direct dependency path to our Target concept of ?federal bureaucracy?, we drop these from further consideration. The highly imageable word remaining in this list is ?labyrinthine?.      Thus, two candidate relations are extracted from this passage ? ?navigate? and ?labyrinthine?. We shall now show how we use these to discover pro-to-sources for the potential metaphor.  3.4 Discovery of Proto-sources Once candidate relations are identified, we exam-ine whether the usage of these relations is meta-phorical or literal. To determine this, we search for all uses of these relations in a balanced corpus and examine in which contexts the candidate relations occur. To demonstrate this via our example, we shall consider one of the candidate relations identi-fied in Figure 1 ? ?navigate?; the search method is the same for all candidate relations identified. In the case of the verb ?navigate? we search a bal-anced corpus for the collocated words, that is, those that occur within a 4-word window following the verb, with high mutual information (>3) and occurring together in the corpus with a frequency 
70
at least 3. This search returns a list of words, most-ly nouns in this case, that are the objects of the verb ?navigate?, just as ?federal bureaucracy? is the object in the given example. However, since the search occurs in a balanced corpus, given the parameters we search for, we discover words where the objects are literally navigated. Given these search parameters, the top results we get are generally literal uses of the word ?navigate?. We cluster the resulting literal uses as semantically related words using WordNet and corpus statistics. Each such cluster is an emerging prototype source domain, or a proto-source, for the potential meta-phor. In Figure 2, we show three of the clusters ob-tained when searching for the literal usage of the verb ?navigate?. We use elements of the clusters to give names or label the proto-source domains. WordNet hypernyms or synonyms are used in most cases. The clusters shown in Figure 2 represent three potential source domains for the given exam-ple, the labels ?MAZE?, ?WAY? and ?COURSE? are derived from WordNet.  
 Figure 2. Three of several clusters obtained from bal-anced corpus search for objects of verb ?navigate?.       We rank the clusters according to the combined frequency of cluster elements in the balanced cor-pus. In a similar fashion, clusters are obtained for the candidate relation ?labyrinthine?; however here we search for the nouns modified by the adjective ?labyrinthine?.       
3.5 Estimation of Linguistic Metaphor A ranked list of proto-sources from the previous step serves as evidence for the presence of a meta-phor.   If any Target domain elements are found in the top two ranked clusters, we consider the phrase being investigated to be literal. This eliminates examples where one of the most frequently en-countered sources is within the target domain.  If neither of the top two most frequent clusters contains any elements from the target domain, we then compute the average imageability scores for each cluster from the mean imageability score of the cluster elements. If no cluster has a sufficiently high imageability score (experimentally deter-mined to be >.50 in the current prototype), we again consider the given input to be literal. This step reinforces the claim that metaphors use highly imageable language to convey their meaning. If a proto-source cluster is found to meet both criteria, we consider the given phrase to be metaphorical. For the example shown in Figure 1, our system finds ?navigate the ?federal bureaucracy? to be metaphorical. One of the top Source domains iden-tified for this metaphor is ?MAZE?. Hence the conceptual metaphor output for this example can be: ?FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY IS A MAZE?. Our system can thus classify input sentences as metaphorical or literal by the series of steps out-lined above. In addition, we have modules that can determine a more complex conceptual metaphor, based upon evidence of one or more metaphorical passages as identified above. We do not discuss those modules in this article. Once a metaphor is identified, we compute associated Mappings, Af-fect and Force. 3.6 Mappings In the current prototype system, we assign meta-phors to one of three types of mappings. Propertive mappings ? which state what the domain objects  
1. Proto-source Name: MAZE Proto-source Elements: [mazes, system, net-works] IMG Score: 0.74 2. Proto-source Name: WAY Proto-source Elements: [way, tools] IMG Score: 0.60 3. Proto-source Name: COURSE Proto-source Elements: [course, streams] IMG: 0.55

are and descriptive features; Agentive mappings ? which describe what the domain elements do to other objects in the same or different domains; and Patientive mappings ? which describe what is done to the objects in these domains. These are broad categories to which relations can, with some ex-ceptions be assigned at the linguistic metaphor lev-el by the parse tag of the relation. Relations that take Target concepts as objects are usually Pa-tientive relations. Similarly, relations that are Agentive take Target concepts as subjects. Proper-tive relations are usually determined by adjectival relations.     Once mappings are assigned, we can use them to group linguistic metaphors. A set of linguistic met-aphors on the same or semantically equivalent Target concepts can be grouped together if the re-lations are all agentive, patientive or propertive. The mapping assigned to set of examples in Figure 3 is Patientive.      One immediate consequence of the proposed approach is the simplicity with which we can rep-resent domains, their elements, and the metaphoric mappings between domains. Regardless of what specific relations may operate within a domain (be it Source or Target), they can be classified into just 3 categories. We are further expanding this module to include semantically richer distinctions within the mappings. This includes the determination of the sub-dimensions of mappings i.e. assigning groups of relations to a semantic category.  3.7 Affect and Force  Affect of a metaphor may be positive, negative or neutral. Our affect estimation module computes an affect score taking into account the relation, Target concept and the subject or object of the relation based on the dependency between relation and Target concept. The algorithm is applied according to the categories shown in Table 1.      The expanded ANEW lexicon (Bradley and Lang, 2010) is used to look up affect scores of words. ANEW assigns scores from 0 (highly nega-tive) to 9 (highly positive); 5 being neutral. We compute the affect of a metaphorical phrase within a sentence by summing the affect scores of the re-lation and its object or subject.  If the relation is agentive, we then look at the object in source do-main that the Target concept is acting upon. If the object (denoted in above table as X) has an affect 
score that is greater than neutral, and the relation itself has an affect score that is greater than neutral, then a POSITIVE affect is assigned to the meta-phor. This is denoted by the cell at the intersection of the row labeled ?Rel > Positive? and the 3rd col-umn in Table 1. Similarly affect for the other map-ping categories can be assigned.   
 Figure 3. Four metaphors for the Target concept ?feder-al bureaucracy?.   We also seek to determine the impact of metaphor on the reader. This is explored using the concept of Force in our system. The force of a metaphor is estimated currently by the commonness of the ex-pression in the given Target domain. We compute the frequency of the relation co-occurring with Target concept in a corpus of documents in the given Target domain. This frequency represents the commonness of expression, which is the in-verse of Force. The more common a metaphorical expression is, the lesser its force.     For the example shown below in Figure 4, the affect is computed to be positive (?navigate? and ?veterans? are both found to have positive affect scores, the relation is patientive). The force of this expression is low, since its commonness is 742 (commonness score > 100 is high commonness, determined experimentally).

   The focus of this article is the automatic identifi-cation of metaphorical sentences in naturally oc-curring text. Affect and force modules are utilized to understand metaphors in context and contrast them across cultures, if feasible. We defer more detailed discussion of affect and force and their implications to a future, larger article.  4 Evaluation and Results In order to determine the efficacy of our system in classifying metaphors as well as to validate various system modules such as affect and force, we per-formed a series of experiments to collect human validation of metaphors in a large set of examples.  4.1 Experimental Setup  We constructed validation tasks that aimed at per-forming evaluation of linguistic metaphor extrac-tion accuracy. The first task ? Task 1, consists of a series of examples, typically 50, split more or less equally between those proposed by the system to be metaphorical and those proposed to be literal. This task was designed to elicit subject and expert judgments on several aspects related to the pres-ence or absence of linguistic metaphors in text. Subjects are presented with brief passages where a Target concept and a relation are highlighted. They are asked to rank their responses on a 7-point scale for the following questions:  Q1: To what degree does the above passage use metaphor to describe the highlighted concept? Q2: To what degree does this passage convey an idea that is either positive or negative?  Q3: To what degree is it a common way to express this idea?      There are additional questions that ask subjects to judge the imageability and arousal of a given pas-sage, which we do not discuss in this article. Q1 deals with assessing the metaphoricity of the ex-ample, Q2 deals with affect and Q3 deals with force.   Each instance of Task 1 consists of a set of instruc-tions, training examples, and a series of passages to be judged. Instructions provide training examples whose ratings fall at each end the rating continu-um. Following the task, participants take a gram-
mar test to demonstrate native language proficien-cy in the target language. All task instances are then posted on Amazon?s Mechanical Turk. The goal is to collect at least 30 valid judgments per task instance. We typically collect ~50 judgments from Mechanical Turkers, so that after filtering for invalid data which includes turkers selecting items at random, taking too little time to complete the task, grammar test failures, and other inconsistent data, we would still retain 30 valid judgments per passage. In addition to grammar test and time fil-ter, we also inserted instance of known metaphors and known literal passages randomly within the Task. Any turker judgments that classify these known instance incorrectly more than 30% of the total known instance size are discarded.     The valid turker judgments are then converted to a binary judgment for the questions we presented. For example, for question Q1, the anchors to 7-point scale are 0 (none at all i.e. literal) to 7 (highly i.e metaphorical). We take [0, 2] as a literal judg-ment and [4, 6] as metaphorical and take a majority vote. If the majority vote is 3, we discard that pas-sage from our test set, since it is undetermined whether the passage is literal or metaphorical.         We have collected human judgments on hun-dreds of metaphors in all four languages of inter-est. In Section 4.3, we explain our performance and compare our results to baseline where appro-priate.  4.2 Test Reliability The judgments collected from subjects are tested for reliability and validity. Reliability among the raters is computed by measuring intra-class corre-lation (ICC) (McGraw & Wong, 1996; Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). A coefficient value above 0.7 indi-cates strong reliability.  Table 3 shows the current reliability coefficients established for the selected Task 1 questions in all 4 languages. In general, our analyses have shown that with approximately 30 or more subjects we obtain a reliability coefficient of at least 0.7. We note that Russian and Farsi reliability scores are low in some categories, primarily due to lack of sufficient subject rating data. However, reliability of subject ratings for metaphor question (Q1) is sufficiently high in three of the four languages we are interested in.

We have developed 
an automated system that does not require the ex-istence of annotated training data or a knowledge base of predefined metaphors. We have described the various steps for detecting metaphors from re-ceiving an input, to selecting candidate relations, to the discovery of prototypical source domains, and leading to the identification of a metaphor as well as the discovery of the potential source domain being applied in the metaphor. We presented two novel concepts that have heretofore not been fully explored in computational metaphor identification systems. The first is the exclusion of words that form the thread of the discussion in the text, by the application of a Topic Tracking module. The se-cond is the application of Imageability scores in the selection of salient candidate relations.  Our evaluation consists first of validating the eval-uation task itself. Once we ensure that sufficient reliability has been established on the various di-mensions we seek to evaluate ? metaphoricity, af-fect and force ? we compare our system performance to the human gold standard. The per-formance of our system as compared to baseline is quite high, across all four languages of interest when measured against human assessed gold standard.  In this article, we discuss examples of metaphors belonging to a specific Target domain ? ?Govern-ance?. However, we can run our system through data in any domain perform the same kind of met-aphor identification. In cases where the Target do-main is unknown, we plan to use our Topic tracking module to recognize content words that may form part of a metaphorical phrase. This is essentially a process that is the reverse of that de-scribed in Section 3.3. We will find the salient Target concepts where there are directly dependent relations with the imageable verbs or adjectives.  In a separate larger publication, we plan to discuss in detail revisions to our Mapping module as well as the discovery and analyses of more complex conceptual metaphors. Such complex metaphors are based upon evidence from one or more instance of linguistic metaphors. Additional modules would recognize the manifold mappings, affect and force associated with the complex conceptual metaphors.

This article describes a novel approach to automated determination of affect associ-ated with metaphorical language. Affect in language is understood to mean the at-titude toward a topic that a writer at-tempts to convey to the reader by using a particular metaphor. This affect, which we will classify as positive, negative or neutral with various degrees of intensity, may arise from the target of the meta-phor, from the choice of words used to describe it, or from other elements in its immediate linguistic context. We attempt to capture all these contributing elements in an Affect Calculus and demonstrate experimentally that the resulting method can accurately approximate human judgment. The work reported here is part of a larger effort to develop a highly ac-curate system for identifying, classifying, and comparing metaphors occurring in large volumes of text across four differ-ent languages: English, Spanish, Russian, and Farsi. 1 Introduction We present an approach to identification and val-idation of affect in linguistic metaphors, i.e., metaphorical expressions occurring in written language. Our method is specifically aimed at isolating the affect conveyed in metaphors as opposed to more broad approaches to sentiment classification in the surrounding text. We demonstrate experimentally that our basic Affect Calculus captures metaphor-related affect with a high degree of accuracy when applied to neutral metaphor targets. These are targets that them-selves do not carry any prior valuations. We sub-
sequently expanded and refined this method to properly account for the contribution of the prior affect associated with the target as well as its immediate linguistic context.  2 Metaphor in Language Metaphors are mapping systems that allow the semantics of a familiar Source domain to be ap-plied to a new Target domain so as to invite new frameworks for reasoning (usually by analogy) to emerge in the target domain. The purpose of a metaphor is (a) to simplify or enable reasoning and communication about the target domain that would otherwise be difficult (because of tech-nical complexity) or impossible (due to lack of agreed upon vocabulary) (e.g., Lakoff & John-son, 1980; 2004); or (b) to frame the target do-main in a particular way that enables one form of reasoning while inhibiting another (e.g., Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2011). The two rea-sons for using metaphors are not necessarily mu-tually exclusive, in other words, (a) and (b) can operate at the same time. The distinction sug-gested above has to do with affect: a metaphor formed through (a) alone is likely to be neutral (e.g., client/server, messenger DNA), while a metaphor formed using (b) is likely to have a polarizing affect (e.g., tax?s burden).  The Source and Target domains that serve as endpoints of a metaphoric mapping can be repre-sented in a variety of ways; however, in a nut-shell they are composed of two kinds of things: concepts and relations. In a Target domain the concepts are typically abstract, disembodied, of-ten fuzzy concepts, such as crime, mercy, or vio-lence, but may also include more concrete, novel, or elaborate concepts such as democracy or eco-nomic inequality. In a Source domain, the con-cepts are typically concrete and physical; howev-er, mapping between two abstract domains is 
42
also possible. (E.g., crime may be both a target and a source domain.)  The relations of interest are those that operate between the concepts within a Source domain and can be ?borrowed? to link concepts within the Target domain, e.g., ?Crime(TARGET) spread to(RELATION) previously safe areas? may be bor-rowing from a DISEASE or a PARASITE source domain.  3 Related Research: metaphor detection Most current research on metaphor falls into three groups: (1) theoretical linguistic approach-es (as defined by Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; and their followers) that generally look at metaphors as abstract language constructs with complex semantic properties; (2) quantitative linguistic approaches (e.g., Charteris-Black, 2002; O?Halloran, 2007) that attempt to correlate met-aphor semantics with their usage in naturally oc-curring text but generally lack robust tools to do so; and (3) social science approaches, particular-ly in psychology and anthropology that seek to explain how people produce and understand met-aphors in interaction, but which lack the neces-sary computational tools to work with anything other than relatively isolated examples. In computational investigations of metaphor, knowledge-based approaches include MetaBank (Martin, 1994), a large knowledge base of meta-phors empirically collected. Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) use WordNet (Felbaum, 1998) knowledge to differentiate between metaphors and literal usage. Such approaches entail the ex-istence of lexical resources that may not always be present or satisfactorily robust in different languages. Gedigan et al. (2006) identify a sys-tem that can recognize metaphor; however their approach is only shown to work in a narrow do-main (The Wall Street Journal, for example).  Computational approaches to metaphor (largely AI research) to date have yielded only limited scale, often hand designed systems (Wilks, 1975; Fass, 1991; Martin, 1994; Carbonell, 1980; Feldman & Narayan, 2004; Shutova & Teufel, 2010; inter alia, also Shutova, 2010b for an over-view). Baumer et al. (2010) used semantic role labels and typed dependency parsing in an at-tempt towards computational metaphor identifi-cation. However, they describe their own work as an initial exploration and hence, inconclusive. Shutova et al. (2010a) employ an unsupervised method of metaphor identification using nouns and verb clustering to automatically impute met-
aphoricity in a large corpus using an annotated training corpus of metaphors as seeds. Their method relies on annotated training data, which is difficult to produce in large quantities and may not be easily generated in different languages. Several other similar approaches were recently reported at the Meta4NLP 1  workshop, e.g., (Mohler et al., 2013; Wilks et al., 2013; Hovy et al., 2013). Most recently, a significantly different ap-proach to metaphor understanding based on lexi-cal semantics and discourse analysis was intro-duced by Strzalkowski et al. (2013). Space con-straints limit our discussion about their work in this article, however in the foregoing, our discus-sion is largely consistent with their framework. 4 Affect in Metaphors Affect in language is understood to mean the atti-tude toward a topic that a speaker/writer attempts to convey to the reader or audience via text or speech (van der Sluis and Mellish 2008).  It is expressed through multiple means, many of which are unrelated to metaphor. While affect in text is often associated, at least in theory, with a variety of basic emotions (anger, fear, etc.), it is generally possible to classify the set of possible affective states by polarity: positive, negative, and sometimes neutral. Affect is also considered to have a graded strength, sometimes referred to as intensity.  Our approach to affect in metaphor has been vetted not only by our core linguistic team but also by an independent team of linguist-analysts with whom we work to understand metaphor across several language-culture groups. Our re-search continues to show no difficulties in com-prehension or disagreement across languages concerning the concept of linguistic affect, of its application to metaphor, and of its having both polarity and intensity.  5 Related Research: sentiment and af-fect There is a relatively large volume of research on sentiment analysis in language (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007; Wiebe and Cardie, 2005; inter alia) that aim at detecting polarity of text, but is not specifically concerned with metaphors. A number of systems were de-veloped to automatically extract writer?s senti-                                                1 The First Workshop on Metaphor in NLP. http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W13/W13-09.pdf

ment towards specific products or services such as movies or hotels, from online reviews (e.g., Turney, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2008) or social me-dia messages (e.g., Thelwall et al., 2010). None of these techniques has been applied specifically to metaphorical language, and it is unclear if the-se alone would be sufficient due to the relatively complex semantics involved in metaphor inter-pretation. Socher et al. (2013 cite) have recently used recursive neural tensor networks to classify sentences into positive/negative categories. However, the presence of largely negative con-cepts such as ?poverty? in a given sentence overwhelms the sentiment for the sentence in their method. Other relevant efforts in sentence level sentiment analysis include Sem-Eval Task2.  While presence of affect in metaphorical lan-guage is well documented in linguistic and psy-cholinguistic literature (e.g., Osgood, 1980; Pavio and Walsh, 1993; Caffi and Janney, 1994; Steen, 1994), relatively little work was done to detect affect automatically. Some notable recent efforts include Zhang and Barnden (2010), Veale and Li (2012), and Kozareva (2013), who pro-posed various models of metaphor affect classifi-cation based primarily on lexical features of the surrounding text: specifically the word polarity information. In these and other similar approach-es, which are closely related to sentiment analy-sis, affect is attributed to the entire text fragment: a sentence or utterance containing a metaphor, or in some cases the immediate textual context around it.  In contrast, our objective is to isolate affect due to the metaphor itself, independently of its particular context, and also to determine how various elements of the metaphoric expression contribute to its polarity and strength. For exam-ple, we may want to know what is the affect conveyed about the Government as a target con-cept of the metaphor in ?Government regulations are crushing small businesses.? and how it dif-fers in  ?Government programs help to eradicate poverty in rural areas.? or in ?Feds plan to raise the tax on the rich.? In all these examples, there is a subtle interplay between the prior affect as-sociated with certain words (e.g., ?crush?, ?pov-erty?) and the semantic role they occupy in the sentence (e.g., agent vs. patient vs. location, etc.). Our objective is to develop an approach that can better explain such differences. Not sur-prisingly, in one of the target domains we are investigating, the Economic Inequality domain,                                                 2 https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task2/ 
there is considerable agreement on the basic atti-tudes across cultures towards the key target con-cepts: poverty is negative, wealth is positive, taxation is largely negative, and so on. This is in a marked contrast with another Target domain, the Governance domain where the target con-cepts tend to be neutral (e.g. bureaucracy, regula-tions etc.) Another important motivation in developing our approach (although not discussed in this pa-per) is to obtain a model of affect that would help to explain empirically why metaphorically rich language is considered highly influential. Persua-sion and influence literature (Soppory and Dillard, 2002) indicates messages containing metaphorical language produce somewhat great-er attitude change than messages that do not. However, some recent studies (e.g., Broadwell et al., 2012) found that lexical models of affect, sentiment, or emotion in language do not corre-late with established measures of influence, con-trary to expectations. Therefore, a different ap-proach to affect is needed based both on lexical and semantic features. We describe this new model below, and show some preliminary results in applications to metaphors interpretation. 6 Basic Affect Calculus The need for a new approach to affect arises from the inability of the current methods of sen-timent analysis to capture the affect that is con-veyed by the metaphor itself, which may be only a part of the overall affect expressed in a text. Affect conveyed in metaphors, while often more polarized than in literal language, is achieved using subtler, less explicit, and more modulated expressions. This presents a challenge for NLP approaches that base affect determination upon the presence of explicit sentiment markers in language that may mask affect arising from a metaphor. This problem becomes more challeng-ing when strong, explicit sentiment markers are present in a surrounding context or when the atti-tude of the speaker/writer towards the target con-cept is considered.  Our initial objective is thus to detect and clas-sify the portion of affect that the speaker/writer is trying to convey by choosing a specific meta-phor. The observables here are the linguistic metaphors that are actually uttered or written; therefore, our method must be able to determine affect present in the linguistic metaphors first and then extrapolate to the conceptual metaphor based on evidence across multiple uses of the 
44
same metaphor. Conceptual metaphors are posit-ed by instances of linguistic metaphors that point to the same source domain. We choose initially to model the speaker/writer perspective; howev-er, it may also be important to determine the ef-fect that a metaphor has on the reader/listener, which we do not address here. Affect in metaphor arises from the juxtaposi-tion of a Source and a Target domain through the relations explicated in linguistic metaphors. The-se relations typically involve one or more predi-cates from the source domain that are applied to a target concept. For example, in ?Government regulations are crushing small businesses.? the relation ?crushing? is borrowed from a concrete source domain (e.g., Physical Burden), and used with an abstract target concept of ?government regulation? which becomes the agentive argu-ment, i.e., crushed(GovReg, X), where X is an optional patientive argument, in this case ?small businesses?. Thus, government regulation is said to be doing something akin to ?crushing?, a harmful and negative activity according to the Affective Norms in English (ANEW) psycholin-guistic database (Bradley and Lang, 1999). Since ?government regulation? is doing something negative, the polarity of affect conveyed about it is also negative. The ANEW lexicon we are us-ing contains ratings of ~100K words. The origi-nal ANEW lexicon by Bradley and Lang was expanded following the work done by Liu et al. (2014) in expanding the MRC imageability lexi-con. While other sources of valence judgments exist such as NRC (Mohammad et al., 2013) and MPQA (Weibe and Cardie, 2005), there are limi-tations ? for instance ? NRC lexicon rates each words on a positive or negative scale, which does not allow for more fine-grained analysis of strength of valence.  Calculation from Table 1 is further general-ized by incorporating the optional second argu-ment of the relation and the role of the target concept (i.e., agentive or patientive). Thus, if X=?small business? as in the example above, the complete relation becomes crushed(GovReg, 
SmBus), which retains negative affect assuming that ?small business? is considered positive or at least neutral, an assessment that needs to be es-tablished independently. The above calculations are captured in the Af-fect Calculus (AC), which was derived from the sociolinguistic models of topical positioning and disagreement in discourse (Broadwell et al., 2013).     The Affect Calculus was conceived as a hypo-thetical model of metaphorical affect, involving the metaphor target, the source relation, as well as the arguments of this relation, one of which is the target itself. The basic version of the AC is shown in Table 1. We should note that the AC allows us to make affect inferences about any of the elements of the metaphoric relation given the values of the remaining elements. We should also note that this calculus does not yet incorpo-rate any discernable prior affect that the target concept itself may carry. When the target con-cept may be considered neutral (as is ?govern-ment regulation? when taken out of context) this table allows us to compute the affect value of any linguistic metaphor containing it. This is un-like the target concepts such as ?poverty? which bring their prior affect into the metaphor. We will return to this issue later. In the Affect Calculus table, Relation denotes a unary or binary predicate (typically a verb, an adjective, or a noun). In the extended version of the AC (Section 6) Relation may also denote a compound consisting of a predicate and one or more satellite arguments, i.e., arguments other than AGENT or PATIENT, such as ORIGIN or DES-TINATION for motion verbs, etc.  7 Extended Affect Calculus The basic Affect Calculus does not incorporate any prior affect that the target concept might bring into a metaphor. This is fine in some do-mains (e.g., Government), where most target concepts may be considered neutral. But in other target domains, such as the Economic Inequality domain, many of the target concepts have a 
Relation type Type 1 (proper-tive) Rel(Target) Type 2 (agentive) Rel (Target, X) Type 3 (patientive) Rel(X, Target) Relation/X  X ? neutral X < neutral X ? neutral X < neutral Positive POSITIVE POSITIVE ? UNSYMP POSITIVE ? SYMPAT Negative NEGATIVE ? UNSYMP ? SYMPAT ? SYMPAT ? SYMPAT Neutral NEUTRAL NEUTRAL ? NEUTRAL NEUTRAL ? NEUTRAL Table 1.  A simple affect calculus specifies affect polarity for linguistic metaphors using a 5-point polar-ity scale [negative < unsympathetic < neutral < sympathetic < positive]. X is the second argument.

strong prior affect in most cultures (e.g., ?pov-erty? is universally considered negative). We thus need to incorporate this prior affect into our calculation whenever an affect-loaded target concept is invoked in a metaphor. Where the basic Affect Calculus simply imposes a context-borne affect upon a neutral target concept, the Advanced Affect Calculus must combine it with the prior affect carried by the target concept, de-pending upon the type of semantic context. As already discussed, we differentiate 3 basic se-mantic contexts (and additional contexts in the extended Affect Calculus discussed in the next section) where the target concept is positioned with respect to other arguments in a metaphorical expression:  ? Propertive context is when a property of a Target is specified (e.g. deep poverty, sea of wealth) ? Agentive context is when the Target appears as an agent of a relation that may involve an-other concept (Argument X) in the patient role (e.g. Government regulations are crush-ing?, Government programs help?) ? Patientive context is when the Target ap-pears in the patient role that involves another concept (possibly implicit, Argument X) in the agent role. (e.g. ?eradicate poverty., ?.navigate government bureaucracy)  Table 1 (in the previous section) specifies how to calculate the affect expressed towards the tar-get depending upon the affect associated with the Relation and the Argument X. In the Advanced Affect Calculus, this table specifies the context-borne affect that interacts with the affect associ-ated with the target. When the target prior affect is unknown or assumed neutral, the AC table is applied directly, as explained previously. When the target has a known polarized affect, either positive or negative, the values in the AC table are used to calculate the final affect by combin-ing the prior affect of the target with an appro-priate value from the table. This is necessary for affect-loaded target concepts such as ?poverty? or ?wealth? that have strong prior affect and can-not be considered neutral.  In order to calculate the combined affect we define two operators ? and ?. These operators form simple polarity algebra shown in Table 2. When the Target is in a Patientive relation, we use ?  to combine its affect with the context val-ue from the AC table; otherwise, we use ? .  In the table for ? operator, we note that combining opposing affects from the Target and the Rela-
tion causes the final affect to be undetermined (UND). In such cases we will take the affect of the stronger element (more polarized score) to prevail. ?  pos neg neu  ?  pos neg neu 
pos pos neg pos pos pos UND pos 
neg neg pos neg neg UND neg neg 
neu pos neg neu neu pos neg neu Table 2: Polarity algebra for extended affect calculus  More specifically, in order to determine the combined polarity score in these cases, we com-pute the distance between each element?s ANEW score and the closest boundary of the neutral range of scores. For example, ANEW scores are assigned on a 10-point continuum (derived from human judgments on 10-point Likert scale) from most negative (0) to most positive (9). Values in the range of 3.0 to 5.0 may be considered neutral (this range can be set differently for target con-cepts and relations): ? Poverty affect score = 1.67 (ANEW) ? 3 (neutral lower) = -1.33 ? Grasp affect score = 5.45 (ANEW) ? 5 (neutral upper)= +0.45 Consider the expression ?poverty?s grasp?. Since poverty is a polarized target concept in Propertive position, we use ? operator to com-bine its affect value with that of Relation (grasp). The result is negative: ? ?Poverty?s grasp? affect score (via AC?) = -1.33 + 0.45 = -0.82 (negative) When the combined score is close to 0 (-0.5 to +0.5) the final affect is neutral. 7.1 Exceptions The above calculus works in a majority of cases, but there are exceptions requiring specialized handling. An incomplete list of these is below (and cases will be added as we encounter them): Reflexive relations. In some cases the target is in the agentive position but semantically it is also a patient, as in ?poverty is spreading?. These cases need to be handled carefully ? although the current AC may be able to handle them in some contexts. When interpreted as an agentive rela-
46
tion, the affect of ?poverty is spreading? comes out as undetermined but would likely be output as negative on the basis of the strong negative affect associated with poverty (vs. weaker posi-tive affect of ?spreading?). When handled as a patientive relation (an unknown force is spread-ing poverty), it comes out clearly and strongly negative. Similarly, ?wealth is declining? is best handled through patientive relation. Therefore, for this AC we will treat intransitive relations as patientive.  Causative relations. Some relations denoted by causative verbs such as ?alleviate?, ?mitigate? or ?ease? appear to presuppose that their patient argument has negative affect, and their positive polarity already incorporates this assumption. Thus, ?alleviate? is best interpreted as ?reduce the negative of?, which inserts an extra negation into the calculation. Without considering this extra negation we would calculate ?alleviate(+) poverty(-)? as negative (doing something posi-tive to a negative concept), which is not the ex-pected reading. Therefore, the proposed special handling is to treat ?alleviate? and similar rela-tions as always producing positive affect when applied to negative targets.  8 Extensions to Basic Affect Calculus The basic model presented in the preceding sec-tion oversimplifies certain more complex cases where the metaphoric relation involves more than 2 arguments. Consequently, we are consid-ering several extensions to the basic Affect Cal-culus as suggested below. The foregoing should be treated as hypotheses subject to validation.  One possible extension involves relations rep-resented by verbs of motion (which is a common source domain) that involve satellite arguments such as ORIGIN and DESTINATION in addition to the main AGENT and PATIENT roles. Any polarity associated with these arguments may impact af-fect directed at the target concept appearing in one of the main role positions. Likewise, we need a mechanism to calculate affect for target concepts found in one of the satellite roles. In ?Federal cuts could push millions into poverty? the relation ?push into? involves three arguments: AGENT (Federal cuts), PATIENT (millions [peo-ple]) and DESTINATION (poverty). In calculating affect towards ?Federal cuts? it is not sufficient to consider the polarity of the predicate ?push? (or ?push into?), but instead one must consider the polarity of ?push into (poverty)? as the compo-site agentive relation involving ?federal cuts?. 
The polarity of this composite, in turn, depends upon the polarity of its destination argument. In other words: polarity(Rel(DEST)) = polarity (DEST) Thus, if ?poverty? is negative, then pushing someone or something into poverty is a harmful relation. Assuming that ?millions [people]? is considered at least neutral, we obtain negative affect for ?Federal cuts? from the basic Affect Calculus table. An analogous situation holds for the ?ORIGIN? argument, with the polarity reversed. Thus: polarity (Rel (ORIGIN)) = ~polarity (ORIGIN) In other words, the act of removing something from a bad place is helpful and positive. For ex-ample, in ?Higher retail wages would lift Ameri-cans out of poverty? the relation compound ?lift out of (poverty)? is considered helpful/positive. Again, once the polarity of the relation com-pound is established, the basic affect calculus applies as usual, thus we obtain positive affect towards ?higher retail wages?. In situations when both arguments are present at the same time and point towards potentially conflicting outcomes, we shall establish a precedence order based on the evidence from human validation data. Another class of multi-argument relations we are considering includes verbs that take an IN-STRUMENT argument, typically signaled by ?with? preposition. In this case, affect inference for the relation compound is postulated as fol-lows: polarity (Rel (INSTR))    = polarity (INSTR) if polarity(INSTR) < neutral   = polarity (Rel) otherwise In other words, using a negative (bad) instru-ment always makes the relation harmful, while using a positive or neutral instrument has no ef-fect on the base predicate polarity.  Other types of multi-argument relations may require similar treatment, and we are currently investigating further possible extensions. In all cases not explicitly covered in the extended Af-fect Calculus, we shall assume the default condi-tion that other satellite arguments (such as TIME, LOCATION, etc.) will have no impact on the po-larity of the source relation compound. In other words: polarity (Rel (s-role)) =default polarity (Rel) 9 Evaluation and Results For an evaluation, our objective is to construct a test that can evaluate the ability of an automated system to correctly identify and classify the af-
47
fect associated with linguistic and conceptual metaphors. A series of naturally occurring text samples containing a linguistic metaphor about a target concept are presented as input to the sys-tem. The system outputs the affect associated with the metaphor, as positive, negative, or neu-tral. The system output is then compared to hu-man generated answer key resulting in an accu-racy score. The evaluation thus consists of two components:  1. Determining the ground truth about affect in test samples;  2. Measuring the automated system?s ability to identify affect correctly.  Step 1 is done using human assessors who judge affect in a series of test samples. Assessors are presented with brief passages where a target concept and a relation are highlighted. They are asked to rank their responses on a 7-point scale for the following questions, among others: ? To what degree does the above passage use metaphor to describe the highlighted concept? ? To what degree does this passage convey an idea that is either positive or negative? It is strictly necessary that input to the system be metaphorical sentences, since affect may be associated with non-metaphoric expressions as well; in fact, some direct expressions may carry stronger affect than subtle and indirect meta-phors. This is why both questions on the survey are necessary: the first focuses the assessor?s at-tention on the highlighted metaphor before ask-ing about affect. If the purpose of the test is to measure the accuracy of assigning affect to a metaphor, then accuracy should be measured against the subset of expressions judged to be metaphorical.  The judgments collected from human asses-sors are tested for reliability and validity. Relia-bility among the raters is computed by measuring intra-class correlation (ICC) (McGraw & Wong, 1996; Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). Typically, a coef-ficient value above 0.7 indicates strong agree-ment. In general, our analyses have shown that we need approximately 30 or more subjects in order to obtain a reliability coefficient of at least 0.7. In addition, certain precautions were taken to ensure quality control in the data. We used the following criteria to discard a subject?s data: (1) completed the task too quickly (i.e., averaged fewer than 10 seconds for each passage); (2) gave the same answer to 85% or more of the test items; (3) did not pass a simple language profi-ciency test; or (4) did not provide correct an-swers to a set of randomly inserted control pas-
sages which have been previously judged by ex-perts to be unequivocally literal or metaphorical. Human judgments are collected using Amazon?s Mechanical Turk services. For each passage in surveys, we would collect at least 30 viable judgments. In addition, we have native language speakers who have been rigorously trained to provide expert judgments on metaphor and affect identification task. Table 3 shows the intra-class correlations for affect determination amongst Mechanical Turk subjects. Experiments were conducted in 4 languages: English, Spanish, Rus-sian, and Farsi.   English Spanish Russian Farsi Metaphor 0.864 0.853 0.916 0.720 Affect 0.924 0.791 0.713 0.797 Table 3: Intra-class correlations for metaphor and affect assessment by Mechanical Turk sub-jects In Figure 1, we present partial evidence that the human assessment collection method cap-tures the phenomenon of affect associated with metaphors. The chart clearly shows that affect tends to be more polarized in metaphors than in literal expressions. The chart is based on more than 11,000 affect judgments for English linguis-tic metaphors and literal expressions about Gov-ernance concepts. We see a highly pronounced tendency towards the polarization of affect (both positive and negative). Ratings of affect (y-axis) in metaphoric expressions (columns 5-7) are judged to be stronger, and in particular more negative than the literal expressions (columns 1-3). A similar trend occurs with other target con-cepts as well as other languages, although the data are less reliable due to smaller test samples. Once an answer key is established using the aforementioned procedures, system accuracy can be determined from a confusion matrix as shown in Table 4. In Table 4, we show system assign-ment of affect versus answer key for English Governance and Economic Inequality target metaphors. Overall accuracy across positive, negative and neutral affect for English test set of 220 samples is 74.5%. Analogous confusion ma-trices have been constructed for Spanish, Russian and Farsi. NLP resources such as parser and lex-icons for the languages other than English are not as robust or well rounded; therefore affect classi-fication accuracy in those languages is impacted.

Our method was eval-uated through a series of rigorous experiments 
where more than several dozen of qualified as-sessors judged hundreds of sentences (extracted from online sources) that contained metaphorical expressions. The objective was to capture affect associated with the metaphor itself. Our system can approximate human judgment with accuracy ranging from 59% for Russian to 74% for Eng-lish. These results are quite promising. The dif-ferences are primarily due to varied robustness of the language processing tools (such as parsers and morphological analyzers) that are available for each language. We note that a direct compar-ison to lexical approaches such as described by Kozareva (2013) is not possible at this time due to differences in assessment methodology, alt-hough it remains one of our objectives.  Our next step is to demonstrate that the new way of calculating affect can lead to a reliable model of affective language use that correlates with other established measures of influence.

 Abstract This article makes two contributions towards the use of lexical resources and corpora; specifically making use of them for gaining access to and using word associations. The direct application of our approach is for detecting linguistic and conceptual metaphors automatically in text. We describe our method of building conceptual spaces, that is, defining the vocabulary that characterizes a Source Domain (e.g., Disease) of a conceptual metaphor (e.g., Poverty is a Disease). We also describe how these conceptual spaces are used to group linguistic metaphors into conceptual metaphors. Our method works in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi. We provide details of how our method can be evaluated and evaluation results that show satisfactory performance across all languages. 1 Introduction Metaphors are communicative devices that are pervasive in discourse. When understood in a cultural context, they provide insights into how a culture views certain salient concepts, typically broad, abstract concepts such as poverty or democracy. In our research, we are focusing on metaphors on targets of governance, economic inequality and democracy, although our approach works for metaphors on any target. Suppose it is found in a culture that its people use metaphors when speaking of poverty; for example, they may talk about ?symptom of poverty? or that ?poverty infects areas of the city?. These expressions are linguistic metaphors that are instances of a broader conceptual metaphor: Poverty is a Disease. Similarly, if it is found that common linguistic metaphors about poverty for peoples of a culture include ?deep hole of poverty? and ?fall into poverty?, it would lead to the conceptual metaphor: Poverty is an Abyss. A communicator wishing to speak of ways to deal with poverty would use metaphors such as ?treat poverty? and ?cure poverty? to make their framing consistent with the conceptual metaphor of Disease, whereas she would use metaphors such as ?lift out of poverty? when speaking to people who are attuned to the Abyss conceptual metaphor. Here Disease and Abyss are source domains, and poverty is the target domain. Relations, like ?symptom of?, ?infect? and ?fall into? from the respective source domains are mapped onto the target domain of poverty. In order to discover conceptual metaphors and group linguistic metaphors together, we make use of corpora to define the conceptual space that characterizes a source domain. We wish to discover the set of relations that are used literally for a given source domain, and would create metaphors if applied to some other target domain. That is, we wish to automatically discover that relations such as ?symptom?, ?infect?, ?treat? and ?cure? characterize the source domain of Disease, for example. To create the conceptual spaces, we employ a fully automated method in which we search a balanced corpus using specific search patterns.

relations with members of a given source domain. Relations could be nouns, verbs, verb phrases and adjectives that are frequently used literally within a source domain. In addition, we calculate the frequency with which relations occur in a given source domain, or Relation Frequency. We then calculate the Inverse Domain Frequency (IDF), a variant of the inverse document frequency measure quite commonly used in field of information retrieval; the IDF captures the degree of distribution of relations across all source domains under consideration. Using these two measures, the relation frequency and inverse domain frequency, we are able to rank relations within a source domain. This ranked list of relations are then used to group linguistic metaphors belonging to the same source domain together. A group of linguistic metaphors so formed is a conceptual metaphor.  2 Related Research Most current research on metaphor falls into three groups: (1) theoretical linguistic approaches (as de-fined by Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; and their followers) that generally look at metaphors as abstract language constructs with complex semantic properties; (2) quantitative linguistic approaches (e.g., Charteris-Black, 2002; O?Halloran, 2007) that attempt to correlate metaphor semantics with their us-age in naturally occurring text but generally lack robust tools to do so; and (3) social science ap-proaches, particularly in psychology and anthropology that seek to explain how people deploy and understand metaphors in interaction, but which lack the necessary computational tools to work with anything other than relatively isolated examples.     Metaphor study in yet other disciplines has included cognitive psychologists (e.g., Allbritton, McKoon & Gerrig, 1995) who have focused on the way metaphors may signify structures in human memory and human language processing. Cultural anthropologists, such as Malkki in her work on ref-ugees (1992), see metaphor as a tool to help outsiders interpret the feelings and mindsets of the groups they study, an approach also reflective of available metaphor case studies, often with a Political Sci-ence underpinning (Musolff, 2008; Lakoff, 2001).      In computational investigations of metaphor, knowledge-based approaches include MetaBank (Mar-tin, 1994), a large knowledge base of metaphors empirically collected. Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) use WordNet (Felbaum, 1998) knowledge to differentiate between metaphors and literal usage. Such approaches entail the existence of lexical resources that may not always be present or satisfacto-rily robust in different languages. Gedigan et al (2006) identify a system that can recognize metaphor. However their approach is only shown to work in a narrow domain (Wall Street Journal, for example).     Computational approaches to metaphor (largely AI research) to date have yielded only limited scale, often hand designed systems (Wilks, 1975; Fass, 1991; Martin, 1994; Carbonell, 1980; Feldman & Narayan, 2004; Shutova & Teufel, 2010; inter alia, also Shutova, 2010b for an overview). Baumer et al (2010) used semantic role labels and typed dependency parsing in an attempt towards computational metaphor identification. However, they self-report their work to be an initial exploration and hence, inconclusive. Shutova et al (2010a) employ an unsupervised method of metaphor identification using nouns and verb clustering to automatically impute metaphoricity in a large corpus using an annotated training corpus of metaphors as seeds. Their method relies on annotated training data, which is diffi-cult to produce in large quantities and may not be easily generated in different languages.  More recently, several important approaches to metaphor extraction have emerged from the IARPA Metaphor program, including Broadwell et al (2013), Strzalkowski et al. (2014), Wilks et al (2013), Hovy et al (2013) inter alia. These papers concentrate on the algorithms for detection and classification of individual linguistic metaphors in text rather than formation of conceptual metaphors in a broader cultural context. Taylor et al (2014) outlines the rationale why conceptual level metaphors may provide important insights into cross-cultural contrasts. Our work described here is a first attempt at automatic discovery of conceptual metaphors operating within a culture directly from the linguistic evidence in language. 3 Our Approach The process of discovering conceptual metaphors is necessarily divided into two phases: (1) collecting evidence about potential source domains that may be invoked when metaphorical expressions are used; and (2) building a conceptual space for each sufficiently evidenced source domain so that linguistic metaphors can be accurately classified as instances of appropriate conceptual metaphors. In 
211
this paper, we concentrate on the second phase only. Strzalkowski et al (2013) in their work have described a data-driven linguistic metaphor extraction method and our approach builds upon their work. During the source domain evidencing phase, we established a set of 50 source domains that operate frequently with the target concepts we are focusing on (government, bureaucracy, poverty, wealth, taxation, democracy and elections). These domains were a joint effort of several teams participating in the Metaphor program and we are taking this set as a starting point. These are shown in Table 1.   A_GOD	 ? CONFINEMENT	 ?

Set of 50 source domains that operate frequently with target concepts being investigated. Only English names are shown for ease of presentation, equivalent sets in Spanish, Russian and Farsi have been created. Some of the domains are self explanatory, while others require a further specification since the labels are sometimes ambiguous. For example, PLANT represents things that grow in the soil, not factories; similarly, BUILDING represents artifacts such as houses or edifices, but not the act of constructing something; RACE refers to a running competition, not skin color, etc.  Consequently, each of these domains need to be seeded with the prototypical representative elements to make the meaning completely clear. This seeding occurs during the first phase of the process when a linguistic expression, such as ?cure poverty? is classified as a linguistic metaphor. This process of classifying ?cure poverty? as metaphorical is described in detail in Strzalkowski et al. (2013). Part of the seeding process is to establish that a source domain different than the target domain (here: poverty) is invoked by the relation (here: cure). To find the source domain where ?cure? is typically used literally, we form a linguistic pattern [cure [OBJ: X/nn]] (derived automatically from the parsed metaphoric expression) which is subsequently run through a balanced language corpus. Arguments matching the variable X are then clustered into semantic categories, using lexical resources such as Wordnet (Felbaum, 1998) and the most frequent and concrete category is selected as a possible source domain (proto-source domain). From the balanced language corpus, it is possible to compute the frequency with which the arguments resulting from search appear with relation (?cure?). We determine concreteness by looking up concreteness score in MRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart 1981, Wilson 1988). As may be expected, the initial elements of the proto-source obtained from the above patterns will include: disease, cancer, plague, etc. These become the seeds of the source domain DISEASE in our list. The same process was performed for each of the 50 domains listed here, for each of the 4 languages under consideration. Additional Source Domains are continously generated bottom-up fashion by this phase 1 process elaborated above. In Table 2, we show seeds so obtained for a few source domains.

Example of seeds corresponding to a few source domains 
212
Once such seeds are obtained, we perform another search through a balanced corpus in the corresponding language to discover relations that characterize the source domains. The purpose of source domain spaces in our research is two-fold: a) to provide a sufficiently complete characterization of a source domain via a list of relations ; and b) such a list of relations should sufficiently distinguish between different source domains. Creating these spaces is phase 2 of the conceptual metaphor discovery process. We search for nouns, verbs and verb phrases, and adjectives that co-occur with seeds of given source domain with sufficiently high frequency and sufficiently high mutual information. Our goal with this process is to approximate normal usage patterns of relations within source domains. The results of balanced corpora search form our conceptual spaces. The balanced corpora we use are English: Corpus of Contemporary American English (Davies, 2008), Spanish:  Corpus del Espa?ol Actual (Davies, 2002), Russian: Russian National Corpus2 and Farsi: Bijankhan Corpus (Oroumchian et al., 2006). In addition to retrieving the relations, we retrieve the frequency with which these relations can be found to co-occur with seeds of a source domain, Relation Frequency (RF). We calculate Inverse Domain Frequency (IDF) of all relations across all 50 source domains using a variant of the inverse document frequency measure. The formula for IDF is as given below:  IDF = log (total number of source domains / total number of source domains a relation appears in)  For example, if a relation such as ?dive into? is found to appear in two source domains, BODY_OF_WATER and GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURE, then the IDF for ?dive into? would be log (50/2). The rank of a relation is computed as the product of RF and IDF. However, computing rank using RF without normalization results in inflated ranks for relations that are quite common across domains even when they do not sufficiently disambiguate between the domains. We assume a normal distribution of frequencies of relations within a source domain and normalize RF by taking its logarithm. We also normalize with respect to seeds within a source domain. If a relation frequency is disproportionately high with a specific seed, we disregard that frequency. For example, one of the seeds for the source domain of BUILDING is ?house?. A search through balanced corpus for nouns adjacent to ?house? revealed a disproportionately large number for ?white?, which is meant to be the White House, and would be disregarded.  In Table 3, we show a few top ranked relations for the source domains DISEASE and BODY_OF_WATER. In columns 1 and 2, we show the source domain and the relation. Column 3 shows the relation frequency and column 4 shows the part of speech of relation (V=verb or verb phrase, N=noun, ADJ=adjective). An RF score of 800 for row 1 indicates that the relation ?diagnose with? appears 800 times with one or more of the seeds we search for source domain DISEASE (?diagnose with cancer?, ?diagnose with disease? and so on. In column 5, we show the position where the relation is commonly found to co-occur with the source domain. For example, ?afflict? in row 2 has a position ?after? which means it appears after DISEASE: ?DISEASE afflict(s)?; whereas row 3 would be read as ?affict with DISEASE? since it appears ?before?. In column 6, we show the normalized RF*IDF score. The highest RF*IDF score for a relation across our spaces is 2.165. From Table 3, we can see that even if  frequency for some relations may be relatively low, their rank would be high if they are strongly associated with a single source domain.    	 ? 1.	 ?Source	 ?Domain	 ? 2.	 ?Relation	 ? 3.	 ?RF	 ? 4.	 ?Type	 ? 5.	 ?Position	 ? 6.	 ?Norm	 ?RF*IDF	 ?1	 ?

With the conceptual spaces defined in this manner, we can now use them to group linguistic metaphors together. Shaikh et al (2014) have created a repository of thousands of automatically extracted lingusitic metaphors in all four languages, which we are using to create conceptual metaphors. To discover which conceptual metaphors exist within such large sets of linguistic metaphors would be quite challenging, if not impossible, for a human expert. We automatically assign each linguistic metaphor to ranked list of source domains.  Consider the linguistic metaphor ?plunge into poverty?, where the relation is ?plunge into?. We search through our conceptual spaces and retrieve a list of source domains where the relation ?plunge into? may appear. From this list, only the domains that have this relation RF*IDF score higher than a threshold are considered. This threshold is currently assigned to be 0.40, although it is subject to further experimentation. The source domain where the RF*IDF score of ?plunge into? is the highest is chosen as the source domain, along with the next source domains only if the difference in scores is 5% or lower. Tables 4 and 5 depicts this part of algorithm for two relations, ?plunge into? and ?explorar? (from Spanish ? ?explore?). The relation ?plunge into? is thus assigned to BODY_OF_WATER source domain. ?explorar? is assigned to GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURE and BODY_OF_WATER since difference in RF*IDF scores is less than 5%.

Assigning relations of linguistic metaphor to source domains. ?plunge into? is assigned to BODY_OF_WATER; ?explorar? is assigned to GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURE and BODY_OF_WATER Once this process of assigning linguistic metaphors to source domains is accomplished for all linguistic metaphors in our repository, we validate the resulting conceptual metaphors. A small percentage of metaphors cannot be assigned to any of the 50 Source Domains. We explain the validation process in Section 4. In Tables 6 and 7, we show sample conceptual metaphors in English and Spanish. Our validation process revealed an interesting insight regarding forming conceptual metaphor, wherein they should contain relations that are anchors for that given source domain that we shall describe next.  
 Table 6. A conceptual metaphor in English: POVERTY is a BODY_OF_WATER 
214
 Table 7. A conceptual metaphor in Spanish: POVERTY is a DISEASE 3.1 Anchor relations in Conceptual Metaphors When human assessors are presented with a set of linguistic metaphors and the task to assign them into a source domain, some relations will have stronger impact on their decision that others. For example, ?cure? would almost invariably be assigned to DISEASE domain, while ?dive in? would invoke BODY_OF_WATER domain. Other relations, such as ?spread? or ?fall into? are less specific, however, when paired with highly evocative relations above are likely to be classified the same way. Thus, there are two types of metaphorical relations in linguistic metaphors: (1) the highly evocative relations that unambigously point to a specific source domain ? we shall call them anchors; and (2) the relations that are compatible with the anchor but are not anchors themselves. We can add another class: (3) the relations that are not compatible with a given anchor. Thus, a set of linguistic metaphors that provides evidence for a conceptual metaphor should contain at least some anchor relations and the balance of the set may be composed of anchor-compatible relations. Our current hypothesis is that there should be at least one anchor for each 7 anchor compatible relations for a group of linguistic metaphors to provide a sufficient evidence for a conceptual metaphor.  As part of our validation process, we conducted a series of experiments with human assessors. One of the tasks was to assign a single linguistic metaphor to one of 50 source domains. As an illustrative example, we show in Table 8, one linguistic metaphor. When presented with this example, a majority of assessors chose ENEMY source domain, while DISEASE was selected second. Additionally, there was greater variance among their selections, only 31% chose the top source domain of ENEMY.  Subsequently, human assessors were presented a set of linguistic metaphors where at least one anchor relation was present. In this case, the majority of assessors chose the DISEASE source domain. Even though the ?fight against poverty? example was included in the set, the presence of anchors such as ?cure poverty? and ?treat poverty? lead assessors to choose DISEASE source domain. The variance in selection was also less, a 70% majority choosing DISEASE. We show the conceptual metaphor in Table 9.  The	 ?summit	 ?has	 ?proven	 ?that	 ?there	 ?is	 ?a	 ?renewed	 ?appetite	 ?for	 ?the	 ?fight	 ?against	 ?poverty.	 ?	 ?ENEMY:	 ?31%;	 ?DISEASE:	 ?17%;	 ?ANIMAL,	 ?MONSTER,?.<10%	 ?Table 8.

4 Evaluation and Results A group of human experts who are native speakers and have been substantively trained to achieve high levels of agreement (0.78 Krippendorf?s alpha (1970) or higher) form our validation team. In addition, we aim to run crowd-sourced experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In Figure 1, we show a web interface we built to present our human assessors. The task shown here is the assignment of a single linguistic metaphor to one of 50 source domains. Then, we present our validation team with conceptual metaphors we created. Each conceptual metaphor is validated by at least two language experts. This interface is shown in Figure 2. These interfaces are carefully created by our team of social scientists and psychologists, designed to elicit proper responses from native speakers of the language.

 Figure 2. Interface of task where human assessors select source domains for a conceptual metaphor. Assessors provide their top two choices along with a description detailing how they made their decision.  In Table 10, we show the number of conceptual metaphors currently in the repository and the accuracy of our method across four languages, as computed by using validation data. We show the number of conceptual metaphors present in the Governance target domain (metaphors about government and bureaucracy), Economic Inequality (dealing with metaphors of poverty, wealth and taxation) and Democracy (democracy and elections metaphors). These conceptual metaphors on the three target domains of Governace, Economic Inequality and Democracy, when compared across cultures could provide deep insight about peoples? perceptions regarding salient concepts. We note that Russian and Farsi performance is lower than that in English and Spanish. The size of balanced corpus and accuracy of lexical tools such as stemmers and morphological analyzers affect performance of our algorithm.  The Farsi balanced corpus is relatively small when compared to English balanced corpus. The smaller size affects computation of statistics such as Relation Frequency and subsequently the thresholds of RF*IDF scores. One improvement we are currently investigating is that the thresholds may be set specifically for a language.   	 ? ENGLISH	 ? SPANISH	 ? RUSSIAN	 ?

5 Conclusion and Future Work In this article, we presented our approach towards automatic discovery of conceptual metaphors directly from linguistic evidence in a given language. We make use of corpora in two unique ways: the first is to discover prototypical seeds that form the basis of source domains and second is to create conceptual spaces that allow us to characterize the relations that operate within source domains automatically. In addition, our approach also allows us to distinguish between source domains as necessary. The validation results show that this is indeed a promising first attempt of tackling a challenging research problem.  We note that the assignment of source domains is limited to the set of 50 in our current prototype. This assumes a closed set of 50 source domains, whereas in reality, there might be many others that operate in the realm of metaphors we are investigating. Although additional source domains are continually being discovered in a bottom-up fashion by the linguistic metaphor extraction process, we cannot account for every source domain that may be relevant. One way of overcoming this limitation would be to define a source domain ?OTHER? that would be the all-encompassing domain accounting for any yet undiscovered domains. The details of how it would be represented are still under investigation.  Another potential improvement to our method is to experimentally refine the threshold score of RF*IDF. Through large scale validation experiments, we could learn the optimal thresholds automatically by using machine learning. 6 Acknowledgements This paper is based on work supported by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) via Department of Defense US Army Research Laboratory contract number W911NF-12-C-0024.
