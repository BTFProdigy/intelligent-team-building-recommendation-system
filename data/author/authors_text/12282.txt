Abstract 
This paper presents English?Hindi translit-
eration in the NEWS 2009 Machine Translit-
eration Shared Task adding source context 
modeling into state-of-the-art log-linear 
phrase-based statistical machine translation 
(PB-SMT). Source context features enable us 
to exploit source similarity in addition to tar-
get similarity, as modelled by the language 
model. We use a memory-based classification 
framework that enables efficient estimation of 
these features while avoiding data sparseness 
problems.We carried out experiments both at 
character and transliteration unit (TU) level. 
Position-dependent source context features 
produce significant improvements in terms of 
all evaluation metrics. 
1 Introduction 
Machine Transliteration is of key importance in 
many cross-lingual natural language processing 
applications, such as information retrieval, ques-
tion answering and machine translation (MT). 
There are numerous ways of performing auto-
matic transliteration, such as noisy channel mod-
els (Knight and Graehl, 1998), joint source chan-
nel models (Li et al, 2004), decision-tree models 
(Kang and Choi, 2000) and statistical MT models 
(Matthews, 2007). 
For the shared task, we built our machine 
transliteration system based on phrase-based sta-
tistical MT (PB-SMT) (Koehn et al, 2003) using 
Moses (Koehn et al, 2007).  We adapt PB-SMT 
models for transliteration by translating charac-
ters rather than words as in character-level trans-
lation systems (Lepage & Denoual, 2006). How-
ever, we go a step further from the basic PB-
SMT model by using source-language context 
features (Stroppa et al, 2007). We also create 
translation models by constraining the character-
level segmentations, i.e. treating a consonant-
vowel cluster as one transliteration unit.  
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2 we give a brief overview of 
PB-SMT. Section 3 describes how context-
informed features are incorporated into state-of-
art log-linear PB-SMT. Section 4 includes the 
results obtained, together with some analysis. 
Section 5 concludes the paper. 
2 Log-Linear PB-SMT  
Translation is modelled in PB-SMT as a decision 
process, in which the translation Ie1 = e1 . . .  eI of 
a source sentence Jf1 = f1 . . . fJ is chosen to 
maximize (1):

The translational features involved depend 
only on a pair of source/target phrases and do not 
take into account any context of these phrases. 
This means that each feature mh   in (2) can be 
rewritten as in (4):

tion process amounts to: (i) choosing a segmen-
tation of the source sentence, (ii) translating each 
source phrase. 
3 Source Context Features in Log-
Linear PB-SMT 
The context of a source phrase kf?  is defined as 
the sequence before and after a focus phrase kf?  
=
kk ji
ff ... . Source context features (Stroppa et 
al., 2007) include the direct left and right context 
words (in our case, character/TU instead of word) 
of length l (resp. lii kk ff ?? ...1  and ljj kk ff ?? ...1 ) of 
a given focus phrase kf? = kk ji ff ... . A window of 
size 2l+1 features including the focus phrase is 
formed. Thus lexical contextual information (CI) 
can be described as in (6): 
CI = }...,...{ 11 ljjili kkkk ffff ????                    (6) 
As in (Haque et al, 2009), we considered a 
context window of ?1 and ?2 (i.e. l=1, 2) for our 
experiments. 
One natural way of expressing a context-
informed feature is as the conditional probability 
of the target phrase given the source phrase and 
its context information, as in (7): 
mh? ( kf? ,CI( kf? ), ke? , sk) = log P( ke? | kf? , CI( kf? ))  (7) 
3.1 Memory-Based Classification 
As (Stroppa et al, 2007) point out, directly esti-
mating P( ke? | kf? , CI( kf? )) using relative fre-
quencies is problematic. Indeed, Zens and Ney 
(2004) showed that the estimation of P( ke? | kf? ) 
using relative frequencies results in the overesti-
mation of the probabilities of long phrases, so 
smoothing factors in the form of lexical-based 
features are often used to counteract this bias 
(Foster et al, 2006). In the case of context-
informed features, since the context is also taken 
into account, this estimation problem can only 
become worse. To avoid such problems, in this 
work we use three memory-based classifiers: 
IGTree, IB1 and TRIBL 1  (Daelemans et al, 
2005). When predicting a target phrase given a 
source phrase and its context, the source phrase 
is intuitively the feature with the highest predic-
tion power; in all our experiments, it is the fea-
ture with the highest gain ratio (GR).  
In order to build the set of examples required 
to train the classifier, we modify the standard 
phrase-extraction method of (Koehn et al, 2003) 
to extract the context of the source phrases at the 
same time as the phrases themselves. Importantly, 
therefore, the context extraction comes at no ex-
tra cost.  
We refer interested readers to (Stroppa et al, 
2007) and (Haque et al, 2009) as well as the ref-
erences therein for more details of how Memory-
Based Learning (MBL) is used for classification 
of source examples for use in the log-linear MT 
framework. 
3.2 Implementation Issues 
We split named entities (NE) into characters. We 
break NEs into transliteration units (TU), which 
bear close resemblance to syllables. We split 
English NEs into TUs having C*V* pattern and 
Hindi NEs are divided into TUs having Ch+M 
pattern (M: Hindi Matra / vowel modifier, Ch: 
Characters other than Matras). We carry out ex-
periments on both character-level (C-L) and TU-
level (TU-L) data. We use a 5-gram language 
model for all our experiments. The Moses PB-
SMT system serves as our baseline system. 
The distribution of target phrases given a 
source phrase and its contextual information is 
normalised to estimate P( ke? | kf? ,CI( kf? )). There-
fore our expected feature is derived as in (8): 
mblh? = log P( ke? | kf? ,CI( kf? ))                         (8) 
As for the standard phrase-based approach, 
their weights are optimized using Minimum Er-
ror Rate Training (MERT) of (Och, 2003) for 
each of the experiments. 
As (Stroppa et al, 2007) point out, PB-SMT 
decoders such as Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) or 
Moses (Koehn, 2007) rely on a static phrase-
table represented as a list of aligned phrases ac-
companied with several features. Since these fea-
                                               
1 An implementation of IGTree, IB1 and TRIBL is available 
in the TiMBL software package (http://ilk.uvt.nl/timbl). 
 
105
tures do not express the context in which those 
phrases occur, no context information is kept in 
the phrase-table, and there is no way to recover 
this information from the phrase-table. 
In order to take into account the context-
informed features for use with such decoders, the 
devset and testset that need to be translated are 
pre-processed. Each token appearing in the test-
set and devset is assigned a unique id. First we 
prepare the phrase table using the training data. 
Then we generate all possible phrases from the 
devset and testset. These devset and testset 
phrases are then searched for in the phrase table, 
and if found, then the phrase along with its con-
textual information is given to MBL for classifi-
cation. MBL produces class distributions accord-
ing to the maximum-match of the features con-
tained in the source phrase. We derive new 
scores from this class distribution and merge 
them with the initial information contained in the 
phrase table to take into account our feature 
functions ( mblh? ) in the log-linear model (2). 
In this way we create a dynamic phrase table 
containing both the standard and the context-
informed features. The new phrase table contains 
the source phrase (represented by the sequence 
of ids of the words composing the phrase), target 
phrase and the new score. 
Similarly, replacing all the words by their ids 
in the development set, we perform MERT using 
our new phrase table to optimize the feature 
weights. We translate the test set (words repre-
sented by ids) using our new phrase table. 
4 Results and Analysis 
We used 10,000 NEs from the NEWS 2009 Eng-
lish?Hindi training data (Kumaran and Kellner, 
2007) for the standard submission, and the addi-
tional English?Hindi parallel person names data 
(105,905 distinct name pairs) of the Election 
Commission of India2 for the non-standard sub-
missions. In addition to the baseline Moses sys-
tem, we carried out three different set of experi-
ments on IGTree, IB1 and TRIBL. Each of these 
experiments was carried out on both the standard 
data and the combined larger data, both at char-
acter level and the TU level, and considering 
?1/?2 tokens as context. For each experiment, 
we produce the 10-best distinct hypotheses. The 
results are shown in Table 1. 
We observed that many of the (unseen) TUs in 
the testset remain untranslated in TU-L systems 
                                               
2 http://www.eci.gov.in/DevForum/Fullname.asp 
due to the problems of data sparseness. When-
ever a TU-L system fails to translate a TU, we 
fallback on the corresponding C-L system to 
translate the TU as a post-processing step. 
The accuracy of the TU-L baseline system 
(0.391) is much higher compared to the C-L 
baseline system (0.290) on standard dataset. Fur-
thermore, contextual modelling of the source 
language gives an accuracy of 0.416 and 0.399 
for TU-L system and C-L system respectively. 
Similar trends are observed in case of larger 
dataset. However, the highest accuracy (0.445) 
has been achieved with the TU-L system using 
the larger dataset. 
5 Conclusion 
In this work, we employed source context model-
ing into the state-of-the-art log-linear PB-SMT 
for the English?Hindi transliteration task. We 
have shown that taking source context into ac-
count substantially improve the system perform-
ance (an improvement of 43.44% and 26.42% 
respectively for standard and larger datasets). 
IGTree performs best for TU-L systems while 
TRIBL seems to perform better for C-L systems 
on both standard and non-standard datasets.

Abstract
This paper describes the DCU machine
translation system in the evaluation cam-
paign of the Joint Fifth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation and Metrics
in ACL-2010. We describe the modular
design of our multi-engine machine trans-
lation (MT) system with particular focus
on the components used in this partici-
pation. We participated in the English?
Spanish and English?Czech translation
tasks, in which we employed our multi-
engine architecture to translate. We also
participated in the system combination
task which was carried out by the MBR
decoder and confusion network decoder.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we present the DCU multi-engine
MT system MATREX (Machine Translation using
Examples). This system exploits example-based
MT, statistical MT (SMT), and system combina-
tion techniques.
We participated in the English?Spanish (en?
es) and English?Czech (en?cs) translation
tasks. For these two tasks, we employ several
individual MT systems: 1) Baseline: phrase-
based SMT (Koehn et al, 2007); 2) EBMT:
Monolingually chunking both source and target
sides of the dataset using a marker-based chunker
(Gough and Way, 2004); 3) Factored translation
model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007); 4) Source-side
context-informed (SSCI) systems (Stroppa et al,
2007); 5) the moses-chart (a Moses imple-
mentation of the hierarchical phrase-based (HPB)
approach of Chiang (2007)) and 6) Apertium (For-
cada et al, 2009) rule-based machine translation
(RBMT). Finally, we use a word-level combina-
tion framework (Rosti et al, 2007) to combine the
multiple translation hypotheses and employ a new
rescoring model to generate the final translation.
For the system combination task, we first use
the minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) (Kumar and
Byrne, 2004) decoder to select the best hypoth-
esis as the alignment reference for the confusion
network (CN) (Mangu et al, 2000). We then build
the CN using the TER metric (Snover et al, 2006),
and finally search for the best translation.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 details the various components of
our system, in particular the multi-engine strate-
gies used for the shared task. In Section 3, we
outline the complete system setup for the shared
task and provide evaluation results on the test set.
Section 4 concludes the paper.
2 The MATREX System
2.1 System Architecture
The MATREX system is a combination-based
multi-engine architecture, which exploits as-
pects of both the EBMT and SMT paradigms.
The architecture includes various individual sys-
tems: phrase-based, example-based, hierarchical
phrase-based and tree-based MT.
The combination structure uses the MBR and
CN decoders, and is based on a word-level com-
bination strategy (Du et al, 2009). In the final
stage, we use a new rescoring module to process
the N -best list generated by the combination mod-
ule. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture.
2.2 Example-Based Machine Translation
The EBMT system uses a language-specific, re-
duced set of closed-class marker morphemes or
lexemes (Gough and Way, 2004) to define a way
to segment sentences into chunks, which are then
aligned using an edit-distance-style algorithm, in
which edit costs depend on word-to-word transla-143

tion probabilities and the amount of word-to-word
cognates (Stroppa and Way, 2006).
Once these phrase pairs were obtained they
were merged with the phrase pairs extracted by
the baseline system adding word alignment infor-
mation.
2.3 Apertium RBMT
Apertium1 is a free/open-source platform for
RBMT. The current version of the en?es system
in Apertium was used for the system combination
task (section 2.7), and its morphological analysers
and part-of-speech taggers were used to build a
factored Moses model.
2.4 Factored Translation Model
We also used a factored model for the en?es
translation task. Factored models (Koehn and
Hoang, 2007) facilitate the translation by break-
ing it down into several factors which are further
combined using a log-linear model (Och and Ney,
2002).
We used three factors in our factored translation
model, which are used in two different decoding
paths: a surface form (SF) to SF translation factor,
a lemma to lemma translation factor, and a part-of-
speech (PoS) to PoS translation factor.
Finally, we used two decoding paths based on
1http://www.apertium.org
the above three translation factors: an SF to SF
decoding path and a path which maps lemma to
lemma, PoS to PoS, and an SF generated using
the TL lemma and PoS. The lemmas and PoS for
en and es were obtained using Apertium (sec-
tion 2.3).
2.5 Source-Side Context-informed PB-SMT
One natural way to express a context-informed
feature (h?MBL) is to view it as the conditional
probability of the target phrases (e?k) given the
source phrase (f?k) and its source-side context in-
formation (CI):
h?MBL = logP (e?k|f?k,CI(f?k)) (1)
We use a memory-based machine learning
(MBL) classifier (TRIBL:2 Daelemans and
van den Bosch (2005)) that is able to estimate
P (e?k|f?k,CI(f?k)) by similarity-based reasoning
over memorized nearest-neighbour examples of
source?target phrase translations. In equation (1),
SSCI may include any feature (lexical, syntactic,
etc.), which can provide useful information to
disambiguate a given source phrase. In addition
to using local words and PoS-tags as features,
as in (Stroppa et al, 2007), we incorporate
grammatical dependency relations (Haque et al,
2009a) and supertags (Haque et al, 2009b) as
syntactic source context features in the log-linear
PB-SMT model.
In addition to the above feature, we derived a
simple binary feature h?best, defined in (2):
h?best =
{
1 if e?k maximizes P (e?k|f?k,CI(f?k))
0 otherwise
(2)
We performed experiments by integrating these
two features, h?MBL and h?best, directly into the
log-linear framework of Moses.
2.6 Hierarchical PB-SMT model
For the en?cs translation task, we built
a weighted synchronous context-free grammar
model (Chiang, 2007) of translation that uses
the bilingual phrase pairs of PB-SMT as a start-
ing point to learn hierarchical rules. We used
the open-source Tree-Based translation system
moses-chart3 to perform this experiment.
2An implementation of TRIBL is freely available as part
of the TiMBL software package, which can be downloaded
from http://ilk.uvt.nl/timbl
3http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.SyntaxTutorial144
2.7 System Combination
For multiple system combination, we used an
MBR-CN framework (Du et al, 2009, 2010) as
shown in Figure 1. Due to the varying word or-
der in the MT hypotheses, it is essential to define
the backbone which determines the general word
order of the CN. Instead of using a single system
output as the skeleton, we employ an MBR de-
coder to select the best single system output Er
from the merged N -best list by minimizing the
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) loss, as in (3):
r = argmin
i
Ns?
j=1
(1? BLEU(Ej , Ei)) (3)
where Ns indicates the number of translations in
the merged N -best list, and {Ei}Nsi=1 are the trans-
lations themselves. In our task, we only merge the
1-best output of each individual system.
The CN is built by aligning other hypotheses
against the backbone, based on the TER metric.
Null words are allowed in the alignment. Ei-
ther votes or different confidence measures are as-
signed to each word in the network. Each arc in
the CN represents an alternative word at that po-
sition in the sentence and the number of votes for
each word is counted when constructing the net-
work. The features we used are as follows:
? word posterior probability (Fiscus, 1997);
? 3, 4-gram target language model;
? word length penalty;
? Null word length penalty;
We use MERT (Och, 2003) to tune the weights
of the CN.
2.8 Rescoring
Rescoring is a very important part in post-
processing which can select a better hypothesis
from the N -best list. We augmented our previ-
ous rescoring model (Du et al, 2009) with more
large-scale data. The features we used include:
? Direct and inverse IBM model;
? 3, 4-gram target language model;
? 3, 4, 5-gram PoS language model (Schmid,
1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1996);
? Sentence length posterior probability (Zens
and Ney, 2006);
? N -gram posterior probabilities within the N -
Best list (Zens and Ney, 2006);
? Minimum Bayes Risk probability;
? Length ratio between source and target sen-
tence;
The weights are optimized via MERT.
3 Experimental Setup
This section describes our experimental setup for
the en?cs and en?es translation tasks.
3.1 Data
Bilingual data: In the experiments we used data
sets provided by the workshop organizers. For the
en?cs translation table extraction we employed
both parallel corpora (News-Commentary10 and
CzEng 0.9), and for the en?es experiments, we
used the Europarl(Koehn, 2005), News Commen-
tary and United Nations parallel data. We used a
maximum sentence length of 80 for en?es and
40 for en?cs. Detailed statistics are shown in Ta-
ble 1.

News-Comm en?cs 85k 1.8M 1.6M
CzEng en?cs 7.8M 80M 69M
Table 1: Statistics of en?cs and en?es parallel data.
Monolingual data: For language modeling pur-
poses, in addition to the target parts of the bilin-
gual data, we used the monolingual News corpus
for cs; and the Gigaword corpus for es. For both
languages, we used the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke,
2002) to train a 5-gram language model using all
monolingual data provided. However, for en?es
we used the IRSTLM toolkit (Federico and Cet-
tolo, 2007) to train a 5-gram language model using
the es Gigaword corpus. Both language models
use modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and
Goodman, 1996). Statistics for the monolingual
corpora are given in Table 2.

E/N/NC/UN es 9,6M 290M

Table 2: Statistics of Monolingual Data. E/N/NC/UN
refers to Europarl/News/News Commentary/United Nations
corpora.
For all the systems except Apertium, we first
lowercase and tokenize all the monolingual and
bilingual data using the tools provided by the
WMT10 organizers. After translation, system
combination output is detokenised and true-cased.145
3.2 English?Czech (en?cs) Experiments
The CzEng corpus (Bojar and Z?abokrtsky?, 2009)
is a collection of parallel texts from sources of dif-
ferent quality and as such it contains some noise.
As the first step, we discarded those sentence pairs
having more than 10% of non-Latin characters.
The CzEng corpus is quite large (8M sen-
tence pairs). Although we were able to build
a vanilla SMT system on all parallel data avail-
able (News-Commentary + CzEng), we also at-
tempted to build additional systems using News-
Commentary data (which we considered in-
domain) and various in-domain subsets of CzEng
hoping to achieve better results on domain-
specific data.
For our first system, we selected 128,218 sen-
tence pairs from CzEng labeled as news. For the
other two systems, we selected subsets of 2M and
4M sentence pairs identified as most similar to
the development sets (as a sample of in-domain
data) based on cosine similarity of their represen-
tation in a TF-IDF weighted vector space model
(cf. Byrne et al (2003)). We also applied the
pseudo-relevavance-feedback technique for query
expansion (Manning et al, 2008) to select another
subset with 2M sentence pairs.
We used the output of 15 systems for sys-
tem combination for the en?cs translation task.
Among these, 5 systems were built using Moses
and varying the size of the training data (DCU-
All, DCU-Ex2M, DCU-4M, DCU-2M and DCU-
News); 9 context-informed PB-SMT systems
(DCU-SSCI-*) using (combinations of) various
context features (word, PoS, supertags and depen-
dency relations) trained only on the News Com-
mentary data (marked with ? in Table 4); and one
system using the moses-chart decoder, also
trained on the news commentary data.
3.3 English?Spanish (en?es) Experiments
Three baseline systems using Moses were built,
where we varied the amount of training data used:
? epn: This system uses all of the Europarl and
News-Commentary parallel data.
? UN-half: This system uses the data suplied
to ?epn?, plus an additional 2.1M sentences
pairs randomly selected from the United Na-
tions corpus.
? all: This system uses all of the available par-
allel data.
For en?es we also obtained output from the
factored model (trained only on the news com-
mentary corpus) and the Apertium RBMT sys-
tem. We also derived phrase alignments using the
MaTrEx EBMT system (Stroppa and Way, 2006),
and added those phrase translations in the Moses
phrase table. The systems marked with ? use a
language model built using the Spanish Gigaword
corpus, in addition to the one built using the pro-
vided monolingual data. These 6 sets of system
outputs are then used for system combination.

periments are shown in Table 3 and Table 4 re-

4 Conclusion
This paper presents the Dublin City University
MT system in WMT2010 shared task campaign.
This was DCU?s first attempt to translate from en
to es and cs in any shared task. We developed a
multi-engine framework which combined the out-
puts of several individual MT systems and gener-
ated a new N -best list after CN decoding. Then by146
using some global features, the rescoring model
generated the final translation output. The experi-
mental results demonstrated that the combination
module and rescoring module are effective in our
framework for both language pairs, and produce
statistically significant improvements as measured
by bootstrap resampling methods (Koehn, 2004)
on BLEU over the single best system.
