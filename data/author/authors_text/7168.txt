I n t roduct ion  
Morphological analysis of woMs is a basic 
tool for automatic language processing, and 
indispensable when dealing willl highly 
agglutinative languages like Basque (Aduriz el 
al., 98b). In lhis conlext, some applications, 
like spelling corfeclion, do ilOI need illOl'e lhan 
the seglllOlltation of each word inlo its 
different COlllponenl nlorphellles alollg with 
their morphological information, ltowever, 
there are oiher applications such as lemnializa- 
tion, lagging, phrase recognition, and 
delernlinaiion of clause boundaries (Aduriz el 
al., 95), which need an additional global 
morphological i)arsing j of the whole word. 
Such a complete nlorphological analyzer has 
lo consider three main aspects (l~,ilchie et al, 
92; Sproal, 92): 
1 Morl)hographenfics (also called morpho- 
phonology). This ternl covers orthographic 
variations that occur when linking 
I l lOfphellleS. 
2) morpholactics. Specil'ication of which 
nlorphenles can or cannot combine with 
each other lo form wflid words. 
3) Feature-combination. Specification of how 
these lnorphemes can be grouped and how 
their nlorphosyntactic features can be 
comlfined. 
The system here presented adopts, oil the one 
hand, tile lwo-level fornlalisnl to deal with 
morphogralfilemics and sequential morl)ho- 
lactics (Alegria el al., 96) and, on the other 
hand, a unification-based woM-grammar 2 to 
combine the grammatical information defined 
in nlorphemes and to  tackle complex 
nlorphotactics. This design allowed us to 
develop a full coverage analyzer that processes 
efl'iciently unrestricted texts in Basque. 
The remainder of tills paper is organized sis 
follows. After a brief' description of Basque 
nlorphology, section 2 describes tile 
architecture for morphological processing, 
where the morphosynlactic omponent is 
included. Section 3 specifies tile plaenomena

1 Brief description of Basque 
morphology 
These are the most important features of 
Basque morphology (Alegria et al, 96): 
? As prepositional functions are realized by 
case suffixes inside word-fornls, Basque 
presents a relatively high power to generate 
inflected word-forms. For instance, froth a 
single noun a minimum of 135 inflected 
forms can be generated. Therefore, the 
number of simple word-forms covered by 
the current 70,000 dictionary entries woukl 
not be less than 10 million. 
? 77 of the inflected forms are simple 
combinations of number, determination, 
and case marks, not capable of further 
inflection, but the other 58 word-forms 
ending in one of the two possible genitives 
(possessive and locative) can be further 
inflected with the 135 morphemes. This 
kind of recursive construction reveals a 
noun ellipsis inside a noun phrase and 
could be theoretically exteuded ad 
infinitum; however, in practice it is not 
usual to fiud more than two levels of this 
kind of recursion in a word-form. Taking 
into account a single level of noun ellipsis, 
the number of word-forum coukl be 
estimated over half a billion. 
? Verbs offer a lot of grammatical 
information. A verb tbrln conveys informa- 
tion about the subject, the two objects, as 
well as the tense and aspect. For example: 
diotsut (Eng.: 1 am telling you something). 
o Word-formation is very productive in 
Basque. It is very usual to create new 
compounds as well as derivatives. 
As a result of this wealth of infornmtion 
contained within word-forms, complex struc- 
tures have to be built to represent complete 
morphological information at word level. 
2 An architecture for the full 
morphological ana lyzer  
The framework we propose for the 
morphological treatment is shown in Figure 1. 
The morphological nalyzer is the fiont-end to 
all present applications for the processing of 
Basque texts. It is composed of two modules: 
the segmentation module and the 
morphosyntactic analyzer.

The segmentation ,nodule was previously 
implemented in (Alegria et al, 96). This 
system applies two-level morphology 
(Koskenniemi, 83) for the morphological 
description and obtains, for each word, its 
possible segmentations (one or many) into 
component morphemes. The two-level system 
has the following components: 
? A set of 24 morphograf~hemic rules, 
compiled into transducers (Karttunen, 94). 
? A lexicon made up of around 70,000 items, 
grouped into 120 sublexicons and stored in 
a general lexical database (Aduriz et al, 
98a). 
This module has full coverage of free-running 
texts in Basque, giving an average number of 
2.63 different analyses per word. The result is 
the set of possible morphological segmenta- 
tions of a word, where each morpheme is 
associated with its corresponding features in 
the lexicon: part of speech (POS), 
subcategory, declension case, number, 
definiteness, as well as syntactic function and 
some semantic features. Therefore, the output 
of the segmeutation phase is very rich, as 
shown in Figure 2 with the word amarengan 
(Eng.: on the mother).

The architecture is a modular envhoument that 
allows different ypes of output depending on 
the desired level of analysis. The foundation of 
the architecture lies in the fact lhat TEI-

different formats (Artola et ill., 00). 
3 Word level morl)hosyntactic analysis 
This section Hrst presents the l~henomena lhat 
must be covered by the morphosyntactic 
analyzer, then explains ils design criteria, and 
finally shows implementation and ewfluation 
details. 
3.1 Phenomena covered by the analyzer 
There are several features that emphasized the 
need of morphosyntactic almlysis in order to 
build up word level information: 
I) Multiplicity of values for the same feature 
in successive morphemes. In the analysis 
of Figure 2 there are two different values 
for the POS (noun and declension suffix), 
two for the case (genitive and inessive), 
and two for the syntactic function 
(@nouncomp and @adverbial). Multiple 
values at moq~hemc-level will have to be 
merged to obtain the word level infer 
mation. 
2) Words with phrase structure. Although the 
segmentation is done for isolated words, 
independently of context, in several cases 
3 l?calurc wtlues starling with the "@" character 
correspond to syntactic functions, like @noullcomp 
(norm complement) or @adverbial. 
the mother) 
tile resulting structure is oquiwflent o the 
aualysis of a phrase, as can be seen i, 
Figure 2. 111 this case, although there are 
two different cases (genitive and inessive), 
lhe case of the full word-form is simply 
inessive. 
3) Noun ellipsis inside word-lbrms. A noun 
ellipsis can occur withi, the word 
(oceasi(mally more than once). This 
information must be made explicit in the 
resulting analysis. For example, Figure 3 
shows the analysis of a single word-forln 
like diotsudumtrel&z (Eng.: with what I am 
lelling you). The first line shows its 
segmentation into four morphemes 
(die tsut+en+ 0 +arekin). The feature 
compl ill tile final analysis conveys the 
information for the verb (l um lelliHg you), 
that carries information about pc'rson, 
number and case o1' subject, object and 
indirect object. The feature comp2 
represents an elided noun and its 
declension stfffix (with). 
4) l)erivation and composition are productive 
in Basque. There arc more than 80 deri- 
w/tion morphemes (especially suffixes) 
intensively used in word-fornlatioll. 
3.2 Design of the word-grammar 
The need to impose hierarchical structure upon 
sequences of morphemes and to build complex 
constructions from them forced us to choose a 
unil'ication mechanism. This task is currently 
unsolwlble using finite-state techniques, clue to 
the growth in size of the resulting network 
(Beesley, 98). We have developed a unifica- 
tion based word-grammar, where each rule 
combines information flom different 
mot+lJlemes giving as a result a feature 
structure for each interpretation of a word- 
fol'nl, treating the previously mentioned cases.

Figure 3. Morphosyntactic analysis of diotxudanarekin (Eng.: with what I am tellittg you) 
As a consequence of the rich naorphology of 
Basque we decided to control morphotactic 
phenomena, as much as possible, in the 
morphological segmentation phase. Alterna- 
tively, a model with minimal morphotactic 
treatment (Ritchie et al, 92) would produce 
too many possible analyses after segmentation, 
which should be reiected in a second phase. 
Therefore, we propose to separate sequential 
morphotactics (i.e., which sequences of 
morphemes can or cannot combine with each 
other to form valid words), which will be 
recognized by the two-level system by means 
of continuation classes, and non-sequential 
morphotactics like long-distance dependencies 
that will be controlled by the word-gmnunar. 
The general linguistic principles used to define 
unification equations in the word-grannnar 
rules are the following: 
1) Information risen from the lemma. The 
POS and semantic features are risen flom 
the lemnm. This principle is applied to 
common nouns, adjectives and adverbs. 
The lemma also gives the mnnber in 
proper nouns, pronouns and determiners 
(see Figure 2). 
2) lnfornmtion risen from case suffixes. 
Simple case suffixes provide information 
on declension case, number and syntactic 
function. For example, tile singular 
genitive case is given by the suffix -tell in 
ama+ren (Eng.: of the mother). For 
compound case suffixes the number and 
determination are taken from the first 
suffix and the case from the second one. 
First, both suffixes are joined and after 
that they are attached to the lemma. 
3) Noun ellipsis. When an ellipsis occurs, the 
POS of the whole word-form is expressed 
by a compound, which indicates both the 
presence of the ellipsis (always a noun) 
and the main POS of the word. 
For instance, the resulting POS is 
verb-noun_e l l ips is  when a noun- 
ellipsis occurs after a verb. All the 
information corresponding to both units, 
the explicit lemma and the elided one, is 
stored (see Figure 3). 
4) Subordination morl~hemes. When a 
subordination morpheme is attached to a 
verb, the verb POS and its featm'es are 
risen as well as the subordhmte relation 
and the syntactic fnnction conveyed by the 
naorpheme. 
5) Degree morphemes attached to adjectives, 
past participles and adverbs. The POS and

main features arc taken from the lemma 
and the features corresponding to the 
degrees of comparison (comparative, 
supcrhttive) aft taken from the degree 
morphemes. 
6) l)efiwttion. 1)miwttion suffixes select tile 
POS of the base-form to create the deriw> 
tive anti in most cases to change its POS. 
For instance, the suffix -garri (Eng.: -able) 
is applied to verbs and the derived word is 
an adjective. When the derived form is 
obtained by means o1' a prefix, it does not 
change the POS of the base-form. In both 
cases the morphosyntactic rules add a new 
feature representing the structure of tile 
word as a derivative (root and affixes). 
7) Composition. At the moment, we only 
treat the most freqttent kind of 
composition (noun-noun). Since Basque is 
syntactically characterized as a right-head 
hmguage, the main information of the 
compound is taken from the second 
element. 
8) Order of application of the mofphosyn- 
tactic phenomena. When several morpho- 
syntactic phenomena are applied to the 
same leml l la ,  so as to eliminate 
nonsensical readings, the natural order to 
consider them in Basque is the following: 
lemmas, derbation prefixes, deriwltion 
suffixes, composition and inflection (see 
Figure 4). 
9) Morl)hotactic constraints. Elimination of 
illegal sequences of morphemes, such as 
those due to long-distance dependencies, 
which are difficult to restrict by means of 
conti.uation classes. 
The first and second principles are defined lo 
combine information of previously recognized 
mOrl~hemcs, but all the other principles arc 
related to both feature-combination a d non- 
sequential moq~hotactics. 
3.3 Implementation 
We have chosen the PATR formalism 
(Shiebcr, 86) for the definition of the moqflm- 
syntactic rules. There were two main reasons 
for this choice: 
? The formalism is based o.  unification. 
Unification is adequate for the treatment of 
complex phenomena (e.g., agreement of 
conslituents in case, tmmber and definite- 
hess) and complex linguistic structures. 
? Simplicity. The grammar is not linked to a 
linguistic theory, e.g. GPSG in (Ritchie et 
al., 92)? The fact that PATR is simpler than 
more sophisticated formalisms will allow 
that in @e future the grammar could be 
adapted to any of them. 
25 rules have been defined, distributed in the 
following way: 
? 11 rules for the merging of declension 
morphemes and their combination with the 
main categories, 
? 9 rules for the description of verbal 
subordination morphenles, 
? 2 general fulcs for derivation, 
? 1 rule for each of the following 
phenomeml: ellipsis, degree of COlnpavison 
of adjectives (comparative and SUl)erlative) 
and noun composition. 
3.4 Evaluat ion 
As a cousequence of the size of the lexical 
database and tile extensive treatment of 
nlorphosyntax, the resulting analyzer offers 
full coverage when applied to real texts, 
capable of treating unknown words and non- 
standard forms (dialectal wtriants and typical 
errors). 
We performed four experilnents to ewtluate 
tile efficiency of the implemented analyzer 
(see Table 1). A 10,832-word text was 
randomly selected from newspapers. We 
measured tile number of words per second 
analyzed by the morphosyntactic analyzer and 
also by the whole morphological analyzer 
(results taken on a Sun Ultra 10). Ill the first 
experiment all tile word-t'ornls were analyzed 
one-by-one; while ill tile other three experi- 
ments words with more than one occurrence 
were analyzed only once. Ill the last two 
experimeuts a memory with the analysis of tile 
most frequent word-forms (MFW) in Basque 
was used, so that only word-forms not found 
in the MFW were analyzed.

Table 1. Evaluation results. 
Even when our language is agglutinative, and 
its morphological phenomena need more 
computational resources to build complex and 
deep structures, the results prove tile feasibility 
of implementiug efficiently a fifll 
morphological analyzer, although efficiency 
was not the main concern of our 
implementation. The system is currently being 
applied to unrestricted texts in real-time 
applications. 
4 Related work 
(Koskeniemmi, 83) defined the formalism 
named two-level morphology. Its main 
contributiou was the treatment of 
morl)hographemics and morphotactics. The 
formalisnl has been stmcessfully applied to a 
wide wlriety ot' languages. 
(Karttunen, 94) speeds the two-level model 
compiling two-level rules into lexical 
transducers, also increasing the expressiveness 
of the model 
The morphological analyzer created by 
(Ritchie et al, 92) does not adopt finite state 
mechanisms to control morphotactic 
phenomena. Their two-level implementation 
incorporates a straightforward morphotactics, 
reducing tile number of sublexicons to the 
indispensable (prefixes, lemmas and suffixes). 
This approximation would be highly 
inefficient for agglutinative languages, as it 
would create lnany nonsensical interpretatiolas 
that should be rejected by tile unification 
phase. They use the word-grammar for both 
morphotactics and feature-conlbination. 
ill a similar way, (Trost, 90) make a proposal 
to combine two-level morphology and non- 
sequential morphotactics. 
The PC-Kimmo-V2 system (Antworth, 94) 
presents an architecture similar to ours applied 
to English, using a finite-state segmentation 
phase before applying a unification-based 
grammar. 
(Pr6szdky and Kis, 99) describe a morpho- 
syntactic analyzer for Hungarian, an agglu- 
tinative language. The system clots not use the 
two-level model for segmentation, precom- 
piling suffix-sequences to improve efficiency. 
They claim the need of a word-grammar, 
giving a first outline of its design, although 
they do not describe it in detail. 
(Oflazer, 99) presents a different approach for 
the treatment of Turkish, an agglutinative 
language, applying directly a dependency 
parsing scheme to morpheme groups, that is, 
merging morphosyntax and syntax. Although 
we are currently using a similar model to 
Basque, there are several applications that are 
word-based and need full morphological 
parsing of each word-t'orm, like the word- 
oriented Constraint Graminar formalism for 
disambiguation (Karlsson et aI., 95). 
Conc lus ion  
We propose a model for fllll morphological 
analysis iutegrating two different components. 
On tile one hand, the two-level formalism 
deals with morphographenfics and sequential 
morphotactics and, on the other hand, a 
unil\]cation-based word-grammar combines lhe 
granlll-iatical in\['ornlatioli defined in illoi'- 
phelllOS alld also handles COlllplcx illori)ho- 
tactics. 
Early application of sCqtloniial I/lOrl)hotactic 
conslraints dtu-ing the segmentation process 
avoids all excessive laUlllber of nleaningless 
segmentation possibilities before the 
coulputationally lllOlO expensive unification 
process. Unification permits lhe resohition of a 
wide variety of morl)hological phenonlena, 
like ellipsis, thal force the definition of: 
complex and deep structures Io roprosenl the 
output of the analyzer. 
This design allowed us io develop a full 
coverage allalyzor that processes efficiently 
unrestricted loxis in Basque, a strongly 
agglulinafive langttage.

Abstract 
This paper presents the strategy and design 
of a highly efficient semiautomatic method for 
labelling the semantic features of common 
nouns, using semantic relationships between 
words, and based on the information extracted 
from an electronic monolingual dictionary. The 
method, that uses genus data, specific relators 
and synonymy information, obtains an accuracy 
of over 99% and a scope of 68,2% with regard to 
all the common nouns contained in a real corpus 
of over 1 million words, after the manual 
labelling of only 100 nouns. 
1 Introduction 
Semantic information is essential in a lot of 
NLP applications. In our case, the feature 
[?animate] is necessary to disambiguate between 
the possible Basque translations for the English 
preposition "of" and the Spanish preposition 
"de", when referring to location or possession. 
This ambiguity appears very often when 
translating to Basque [D?az de Ilarraza et al, 
2000]. A complete manual labelling of semantic 
information would prove extremely expensive.  
This study aims to outline the strategy and 
design of a semiautomatic method for labelling 
semantic features of common nouns in Basque, 
expanding and improving the idea outlined in 
[D?az de Ilarraza et al 2000]. Due to the poor 
results obtained, this study dismissed the 
possibility of an initial approach aimed at 
extracting the information corresponding to the 
(?animate) feature automatically from corpus. 
Instead, an alternative idea was proposed, i.e. 
that of using semantic relationships between 
words extracted from the Basque monolingual 
dictionary Euskal Hiztegia (Sarasola 1996). In 
this context, we used genus data and specific 
relators, together with a few words manually 
labelled, to extract the information 
corresponding to the (?animate) feature. The 
results obtained were very promising: 8,439 
common nouns were labelled automatically after 
the manual labelling of just 100.  
This paper describes the work carried out with 
the aim of expanding this idea this idea through 
the inclusion of information about synonymy, 
repeating the automatic process iteratively in 
order to obtain better results  and, monitoring the 
reliability of the labelling of each individual 
noun. After studying the ideal relationship 
between the manual part of the operation and the 
scope of the automatic process, we generalised 
the process in order to adapt it to other semantic 
features. We obtained very satisfactory results 
considering the labelling of common nouns 
contained in the dictionary: for the [?animate] 
feature, we labelled 12,308 nouns with an 
accuracy of 99.2%, after the manual labelling of 
only 100.  
 This paper is organised as follows: section 2 
presents the semantic relationships between 
words extracted from the Basque monolingual 
dictionary, and used by our semiautomatic 
labelling method. The method itself is described 
in section 3. The experiments carried out with 
the aim of optimising the efficiency of the 
method are described in section 4, and section 5 
outlines the accuracy and scope of the labelling 
process for the [?animate] semantic feature. 
Finally, section 6 describes how the method was 
generalised to cover other semantic features. The 
study finishes by underlining the results obtained 
and suggesting future research. 
2 Superficial semantic relationships 
between words in dictionaries  
According to Smith and Maxwell, there are 
three basic methods for defining a lexical entry 
[Smith and Maxwell., 1980]: 
? By means of a synonym: a word with the 
same sense as the lexical entry. 
finish. conclude(sin), terminate(sin) 
? By means of a classical definition: ?genus + 
differentia?. The genus is the generic term or

determine the semantic relationship between

insects (related term) of the Tabanidae family  
One method for identifying the semantic 
relationship that exists between different words 
is to extract the information from monolingual 
dictionaries.  
Agirre et al (2000) applied it for Basque, 
using the definitions contained in the 
monolingual dictionary Euskal Hiztegia. We use 
for our research the information about genus, 
specific relators and synonymy extracted by 
them. 
3 Semiautomatic labelling using genus, 
specific relators and synonymy  
In order to label the common nouns that 
appear in the dictionary, we used the definitions 
of the 26,461 senses of the 16,380 common 
nouns defined by means of genus/relators 
(14,569) or synonyms (11,892).  
The experiment was carried out as follows: 
firstly, we used the information relative to genus 
and specific relators to extract the information 
regarding the [?animate] feature (3.1). 
Subsequently, we also incorporated the 
information relative to synonymy (3.2). Finally, 
we repeated the automatic process iteratively in 
order to obtain better results (3.3). An example 
of the whole process is given in section 3.4. 
3.1 Labelling using information relative to 
genus and specific relators 
Our strategy consisted of manually labelling 
the semantic feature for a small number of words 
that appear most frequently in the dictionary as 
genus/relators. We used these words to infer the 
value of this feature for as many other words as 
possible. 
This inference is possible because in the 
hyperonymy/hyponymy relationship, that 
characterises the genus, semantic attributes are 
inherited. For example, if ?langile? (worker) has 
the [+animate] feature, all its hyponyms (or in 
other words, all the words whose hyperonym is 
?langile?) will have the same [+animate] feature. 
Certain genus are ambiguous, since they 
contain senses with opposing semantic features. 
For example ?buru? (head/boss) has the [-
animate] feature when it means ?head? and the 
[+animate] feature when it means ?boss?. The 
semantic feature of the sense defined can also be 
deduced from some specific relators. In this way, 
the semantic feature of words whose relator is 
?nolakotasuna? (quality) would be [-animate], 
such as in the case of ?aitatasuna? (paternity), for 
example. There are also certain relators that offer 
no information, such as ?mota? (type), ?izena? 
(name), and ?banako? (unit, individual). 
We used four types of labels during the 
manual operation: [+], [-], [?] and [x]. [?] for 
ambiguous cases; and [x] for relators that do not 
offer information regarding this semantic feature. 
 In order to establish the reliability of the 
automatic labelling process for a particular noun, 
we considered the number of senses labelled, 
taking into account the reliability of the labels of 
the genus (or relator) that provided the 
information. The result was calculated as 
follows:   
 Rel_noun = ? Rel_genus_per_sense / n_senses 
During manual labelling, we assigned 
reliability value 1 to all labels, since all the 
senses of these nouns are taken into account.  
Figure 1 shows the algorithm used. For each 
common noun defined in the dictionary, we take, 
one by one, all their senses containing genus or 
relator, assigning in each case the first label 
associated to a genus or relator in the hierarchy 
of hyperonyms. When the sign of all the labels 
are coincident we use it to label the entry, in 
other case, we use the label [?]. In all cases, their 
reliability is calculated.  
When we detect a cycle, the search is 
interrupted and the sense to be tagged remains 
unlabelled.  
3.2 Labelling using synonymy information  
Labelling using genus and relators can be 
expanded by using synonymy. Since the 
synonymy relationship shares semantic features, 
we can deduce the semantic label of a sense if 
we know the label of its synonymes.  
Therefore, the information obtained during the 
previous phase can now be used to label new 
nouns. It also serves to increase the reliability of 
nouns already been labelled thanks to the genus 
information of some of their senses. If the 
synonymy information provided corroborates the 
genus information, the noun?s reliability rating 
increases. If, on the other hand, the new label 
does not coincide with the previous one, a 
special label: [?] is assigned to the noun 
indicating this ambiguity.  
The automatic process using synonymy was 
implemented in the same way as in the previous 
process. 
3.3 Iterative repetition of the automatic 
process  
Our next idea was to repeat the process; since 
the information gathered so far using synonymy 
may also be applied hereditarily through the 
genus? hyperonymy relationship. 
We therefore repeated the process from the 
beginning, trying to label all the senses of the 
nouns that had not been fully labelled during the 
initial operations, by using the information 
contained in the senses of the nouns that had 
been fully labelled (reliability 1). 
As with the initial operation, we first used 
information about genus and relators, and then, 
synonymy.  
This process can be repeated any number of 
times, thereby labelling more and more words 
while increasing the reliability of the labelling 
itself. However, repetition of the process also 
increases the number of words labelled as 
ambiguous [?], since more senses are labelled 
during each iteration, thereby increasing the 
chances of inconsistencies. As we shall see, this 
iterative process improves the results 
logarithmically up to a certain number of 
repetitions, after which it has no further 
advantageous effects.  
3.4 Example of semiautomatic labelling for 
the [?animate] feature 
The 100 words that are most frequently used 
as genus (g) or relators (r) were labelled 
manually for the [?animate] feature, as shown in 
table 2 (tables 3, 4 and 5 contain the Basque 
words processed during the explained operation, 
along with their English translation in italics). 
Noun  ?anim Freq Gen/rel 
nolakotasun (quality) - 531   Relator

Table 2. Manual labelling 
We shall now trace the implementation of the 
automatic labelling process for certain nouns.  
Table 3 shows the results of the first labelling 
process using information about genus and 
relators. The words printed in bold in the results 
column are nouns that were labelled during the 
manual labelling process. We can see how the 
noun ?babesgarri? (protector) is labelled as [-] 
thanks to the information provided by the relator 
of its only sense, which was manually labelled.

thanks to synonym information. The words 
?giltzape? (prison) and ?ikusgune? (viewpoint), 
which had had one sense labelled on the basis of 
genus, now have both senses labelled. The 
reliability rating for ?ikusgune? is calculated as 
f=(1+0.33)/2=0.66. 
We then repeated the process using first the 
genus/relator information (table 4) followed by 
the synonymy information (table 5).   
The aim of this repetition was to label only 
those words that had not been fully labelled, 
using the information provided by the terms that 
had been and that had a reliability rating of 1, 
such as  ?babesgarri?, ?gertaera?, ?espetxe?, 
?adiskide?, ?filosofia?, ?ama?, ?gertakuntza?, 
?lagun?, ?jateko? and ?giltzape? (tables 4 and 5).  
This process succeeded in labelling the senses 
information. On the other hand, ?ikusgune? 
(viewpoint), ?jarrera? (attitude) and ?zinismo? 
(cynicism), did not benefit from this repetition.  
Following this process, we applied the 
synonymy information, thus completing the 
second iteration. The process may be repeated as 
many times as you wish.  
4 Experiments for optimising the 
efficiency of the method  
We carried out a number of different tests for 
the [?animate] semantic feature labelling the 2, 
5, 10, 50, 100, 125 and 150 words most 
frequently used as genus/relators, and repeating 
the whole process (using both genus and relator 
and synonymy information) 1, 2 and 3 times.

terms ?gertakuntza? (event), ?lagun? 
nion) and ?jateko? (food), which 
sly only had one sense, are now labelled 
of ?armadura? (protector), ?adiskidetzako? 
(friend) and ?apio? (celery), previously left 
unlabelled, since their genus ?soineko? 
(garment), ?lagun? (friend) and ?jateko? (food) 
had been fully labelled using the synonym 
 as genus/relators are also the most productive 
during the automatic labelling process. From 
here on, the rate of increase gradually falls, until 
only 7 terms are labelled automatically for every 
noun labelled manually.  
On average, the first 2 nouns each enabled 
1840 terms to be labelled, the next 3 enabled 
1112 while the next 5 enabled only 250. After 
the hundredth noun, this average dropped to just 
7 new terms labelled automatically for every 
term labelled manually. These results are 
illustrated in figure 2. 
For efficiency reasons, we decided that when 
labelling other semantic features, we will label 
manually the 100 nouns most frequently used as 
genus/relators.  
In order to decide the number of iterations 
required for optimum results, we compared the 
results obtained after 1 to 10 iterations after 
manually labelling 100 nouns (Figure 3). 
Although no increase was recorded for the 
number of nouns with reliability rating 1 (i.e. 
with all senses labelled) after the 3rd iteration, the 
results for other reliability ratings continued to 
increase up until the 8th iteration, since as more 
and more information is gathered, new 
contradictions are generated and the number of 
ambiguous labels increases. When the results 
stabilise, we can affirm that all the available 
information has been used and the most accurate 
results possible with this manual labelling 
operation have been obtained. It is important to 
check that the process does indeed stabilise, and 
that it does so after a fairly low number of 
iterations (in this case, after 8). 
The repetition of the process does not 
significantly increase execution time. 10 
iterations of the automatic labelling process for 
the [?animate] feature takes just 11 minutes 33 
seconds using the total capacity of the CPU of a 
Sun Sparc 10 machine with 512 Megabytes of 
memory running at 360 MHz.  
We can therefore conclude that the method is 
viable and that, in the automatic process for 
other semantic features, the necessary iterations 
should be carried out until the results are totally 
stabilised. 
5 Accuracy and scope of the labelling 
process for the [?animate] feature   
In order to calculate the accuracy of the 
automatic labelling process, we took 1% of the 
labelled words as a sample and checked them 
manually. The results are shown in table 6. 
Reliability  
f=1 1>f>0.5 0.5>f>0 Total 
Accuracy 100% 100% 94% 99.2% 
Table 6. Accuracy of automatic labelling 
Although we initially planned to use only the 
labels with a reliability rating of 1, after seeing 
the accuracy of the others, we decided to use all 
the labels obtained during the process, thereby 
achieving an overall accuracy rating of 99.2%. 
We can affirm that the semiautomatic process 
designed and implemented here is very efficient.  
The scope for the automatic labelling of the 
[?animate] feature (table 7) was 75.14% of all 
the nouns contained in the dictionary (12,308 of 
16,380), having manually labelled 100 nouns and

We also calculated the scope of this labelling 
in a real context, using the corpus gathered from 
the newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria, which 
contains 1,267,453 words and 311,901 common 
nouns, of which 7,219 are different nouns. Table 
8 shows the results ? a scope of 69.2% with 
regard to the nouns that appear in the text (47.6% 
of the total number of different common nouns 
contained in the corpus). In other words, after 
carrying out a very minor manual operation, we 
managed to label two out of every three nouns 
that appear in the corpus. Similarly, we noted 
that of the 500 nouns that appear most frequently 
in the corpus, 348 (69.6%) were labelled.

Given the process?s efficiency, it can be 
generalised for use with other semantic features. 
To this end, we have adapted its implementation 
to enable the automatic process to be carried out 
on the basis of the manual labelling of any 
semantic feature.  
So far, we have carried out the labelling 
process for the [?animate], [?human] and

Conclusions 
We have presented a highly efficient 
semiautomatic method for labelling the semantic 
features of common nouns, using the study of 
genus, relators and synonymy as contained in the 
Euskal Hiztegia dictionary. The results obtained 
have been excellent, with an accuracy of over 
99% and a scope of 68,2% with regard to all the 
common nouns contained in a real corpus of over 
1 million words, after the manual labelling of 
only 100 nouns.   
As far as we know, no so method of semantic 
feature labelling has been described in the 
literature, although many authors [Pustejovsky, 
2000; Sheremetyeva & Nirenburg, 2000] claim 
the significance of semantic features in general, 
and [animacy] in particular, for NLP systems. 
One of the possible applications of these 
experiments is to enrich the Basque Lexical 
Database, EDBL, using the semantic information 
obtained.

Abstract 
We present some Language Technology 
applications that have proven to be effec-
tive tools to promote the use of Basque, a 
European less privileged language. We also 
present the strategy we have followed for 
almost twenty years to develop those appli-
cations as the top of an integrated environ-
ment of language resources, language 
foundations, language tools and other ap-
plications. When we have faced a difficult 
task such as Machine Translation to 
Basque, our strategy has worked well. We 
have had good results in a short time just 
reusing previous works for Basque, reusing 
other open-source tools, and developing 
just a few new modules in collaboration 
with other groups. In addition, new reus-
able tools and formats have been produced.  
1 Introduction and Basque Language 
Basque is a highly inflected minority language 
with free order of sentence constituents. Machine 
Translation for Basque is thus both, a real need and 
a test bed for our strategy to develop NLP tools for 
Basque.          
Basque is an isolate language, and little is 
known of its origins. It is likely that an early form 
of the Basque language was already present in 
Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-
European languages. 
Basque is an agglutinative language, with a rich 
flexional morphology. In fact for nouns, for 
example, at least 360 word forms are possible for 
each lemma. Each of the declension cases such as 
absolutive, dative, associative? has four different 
suffixes to be added to the last word of the noun 
phrase. These four suffix variants correspond to 
undetermined, determined singular, determined 
plural and ?close? determined plural.  
Basque is also an ergative-absolutive language. 
The subject of an intransitive verb is in the 
absolutive case (which is unmarked), and the same 
case is used for the direct object of a transitive 
verb. The subject of the transitive verb (that is, the 
agent) is marked differently, with the ergative case 
(shown by the suffix -k). This also triggers main 
and auxiliary verbal agreement. 
The auxiliary verb, which accompanies most 
main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but 
with the direct object and the indirect object, if 
present. Among European languages, this 
polypersonal system (multiple verb agreement) is 
only found in Basque, some Caucasian languages, 
and Hungarian. The ergative-absolutive alignment 
is rare among European languages, but not 
worldwide. 
Although in last centuries Basque suffered 
continuous regression it still remains alive. The 
region in which Basque is spoken is smaller than 
what is known as the Basque Country, and the 
distribution of Basque speakers is not 
homogeneous there. The main reasons of this 
regression (Amorrortu, 2002) are that Basque was 
not an official language, and that it was out of 
educational system, out of media and out of 
industrial environments. Besides, the fact of being 
six different dialects made the wide development 
of written Basque difficult.  
However, after 1980, some of those features 
changed and many citizens and some local 
59
governments promote recovering of Basque 
Language.  
Today, Basque holds co-official language status 
in the Basque regions of Spain: the whole 
autonomous community of the Basque Country 
and some parts of Navarre. Basque has no official 
standing in the Northern Basque Country.   
In the past, Basque was associated with lack of 
education, stigmatized as uneducated, rural, or 
holding low economic and power resources. There 
is not such an association today; Basque speakers 
do not differ from Spanish or French monolinguals 
in any of these characteristics.  
Standard Basque, called Batua (unified) in 
Basque, was defined by the Academy of Basque 
Language (Euskaltzaindia) in 1968. At present, its 
morphology is completely standardized, but the 
lexical standardization process is still underway. 
Now this is the language model taught in most 
schools and used on some media and official 
papers published in Basque.  
Basque speakers are about 700,000, about 25% 
of the total population of the Basque Country, but 
they are not evenly distributed. Still the use of 
Basque in industry and specially in Information 
and Communication Technology is not 
widespread. A language that seeks to survive in the 
modern information society has to be present also 
in such field and this requires language technology 
products. Basque, as other minority languages, has 
to make a great effort to face this challenge (Petek, 
2000; Williams et al, 2001).  
2 Strategy to develop Human Language 
Technology (HLT) in Basque 
IXA group is a research Group created in 1986 by 
5 university lecturers in the computer science fac-
ulty of the University of the Basque Country with 
the aim of laying foundations for research and de-
velopment of NLP software mainly for Basque. 
We wanted to face the challenge of adapting 
Basque to language technology. 
Twenty one years later, now IXA is a group 
composed of 28 computer scientists, 13 linguists 
and 2 research assistants. It works in cooperation 
with more than 7 companies from Basque Country 
and 5 from abroad; it has been involved in the birth 
of two new spin-off companies; and it has devel-
oped more than seven language technology prod-
ucts. 
In recent years, several private companies and 
technology centers in the Basque Country have 
begun to get interested and to invest in this area. At 
the same time, more agents have come to be aware 
of the fact that collaboration is essential to the de-
velopment of language technologies for minority 
languages. One of the fruits of this collaboration 
are HIZKING21 (2002-2005) and ANHITZ (2006-
2008) projects. Both projects were accepted by the 
Government of the Basque Country in a new 
strategical research line called ?Language Infoen-
gineering?. 
At the very beginning, twenty years ago, our 
first goal was just to create a Spanish-Basque 
translation system, but after some preliminary 
work we realized that instead of wasting our time 
in creating an ad hoc MT system with small accu-
racy, we had to invest our effort in creating basic 
tools such as a morphological analyzer/generator 
for Basque, that could later be used to build not 
only a more robust MT system but also other ap-
plications. 
This thought was the seed to design our strategy 
to make progress in the adaptation of Basque to 
Language Technology. Basque language had to 
face up scarcity of resources and tools that could 
make possible its development in Language Tech-
nology at a reasonable and competitive rate. 
We presented an open proposal for making pro-
gress in Human Language Technology (Aduriz et 
al., 1998). Anyway, the steps proposed did not cor-
respond exactly with those observed in the history 
of the processing of English, because the high ca-
pacity and computational power of new computers 
allowed facing problems in a different way.  
Our strategy may be described in two points: 
1) The need for standardization of resources to 
be useful in different researches, tools and applica-
tions 
2) The need for incremental design and devel-
opment of language foundations, tools, and appli-
cations in a parallel and coordinated way in order 
to get the best benefit from them. Language foun-
dations and research are essential to create any tool 
or application; but in the same way tools and ap-
plications will be very helpful in the research and 
improvement of language foundations. 
Following this strategy, our steps on standardi-
zation of resources led us to adopt TEI and XML 
standards and also to define a methodology for 
60
stand-off corpus tagging based on TEI, feature 
structures and XML (Artola et al, 2005). 
In the same way, taking as reference our experi-
ence in incremental design and development we 
proposed four phases as a general strategy for lan-
guage processing. These are the phases defined 
with the products to be developed in each of them. 
1. Initial phase: Foundations. Corpus I (collection 
of raw text with no tagging mark). Lexical da-
tabase I (the first version could be a list of 
lemmas and affixes). Machine-readable dic-
tionaries. Morphological description.  
2. Second phase: Basic tools and applications. 
Statistical tools for the treatment of corpora. 
Morphological analyzer/generator. Lemma-
tizer/tagger. Spelling checker and corrector (al-
though in morphologically simple languages a 
word list could be enough). Speech processing 
at word level. Corpus II (word-forms are 
tagged with their part of speech and lemma). 
Lexical database II (lexical support for the con-
struction of general applications, including part 
of speech and morphological information). 
3. Third phase: Advanced tools and applications. 
An environment for tool integration. Web 
search engine.  A traditional search machine 
that integrates lemmatization and language 
identification. Surface syntax. Corpus III (syn-
tactically tagged text). Grammar and style 
checkers. Structured versions of dictionaries 
(they allow enhanced functionality not avail-
able for printed or raw electronic versions). 
Lexical database III (the previous version is en-
riched with multiword lexical units. Integration 
of dictionaries in text editors). Lexical-
semantic knowledge base. Creation of a con-
cept taxonomy (e.g.: Wordnet). Word-sense 
disambiguation. Speech processing at sentence 
level. Basic Computer Aided Language Learn-
ing (CALL) systems 
4. Fourth phase: Multilingualism and general 
applications. Information extraction. Transla-
tion aids (integrated use of multiple on-line 
dictionaries, translation of noun phrases and 
simple sentences). Corpus IV (semantically 
tagged text after word-sense disambiguation). 
Dialog systems. Knowledge base on multilin-
gual lexico-semantic relations and its applica-
tions.  
We will complete this strategy with some sug-
gestions about what shouldn?t be done when work-
ing on the treatment of minority languages. a) Do 
not start developing applications if linguistic foun-
dations are not defined previously; we recommend 
following the above given sequence: foundations, 
tools and applications. b) When a new system has 
to be planned, do not create ad hoc lexical or syn-
tactic resources; you should design those resources 
in a way that they could be easily extended to full 
coverage and reusable by any other tool or applica-
tion. c) If you complete a new resource or tool, do 
not keep it to yourself; there are many researchers 
working on English, but only a few on each minor-
ity language; thus, the few results should be public 
and shared for research purposes, for it is desirable 
to avoid needless and costly repetition of work. 
3 Machine Translation for Basque 
After years working on basic resources and tools 
we decided it was time to face  the MT task (Hut-
chins and Somers, 1992). Our general strategy was 
more specifically for Machine Translation defined 
bearing in mind the following concepts:  
? reusability of previous resources, specially 
lexical resources and morphology of Basque 
? standardization and collaboration: using a 
more general framework in collaboration 
with other groups working in NLP 
? open-source: this means that anyone having 
the necessary computational and linguistic 
skills will be able to adapt or enhance it to 
produce a new MT system,  
Due to the real necessity for translation in our 
environment the involved languages would be 
Basque, Spanish and English. 
From the beginning we wanted to combine the 
two basic approaches for MT (rule-based and cor-
pus-based) in order to build a hybrid system, be-
cause it is generally agreed that there are not 
enough corpora for a good corpus-based system in 
minority languages like Basque.  
Data-driven Machine Translation (example-
based or statistical) is nowadays the most prevalent 
trend in Machine Translation research. Translation 
results obtained with this approach have already 
reached a high level of accuracy, especially when 
the target language is English. But these Data-
driven MT systems base their knowledge on 
aligned bilingual corpora, and the accuracy of their 
61
output depends heavily on the quality and the size 
of these corpora. Large and reliable bilingual cor-
pora are unavailable for many language pairs. 
3.1 The rule-based approach 
First, we present the main architecture and the pro-
posed standards of an open source MT engine, the 
first implementation of which translates from 
Spanish into Basque using the traditional transfer 
model and based on shallow and dependency pars-
ing. 
The design and the programs are independent 
from the languages, so the software can be used for 
other projects in MT. Depending on the languages 
included in the adaptation, it will be necessary to 
add, reorder and change some modules, but this 
will not be difficult because a unique XML format 
is used for the communication among all the mod-
ules. 
The project has been integrated in the OpenTrad 
initiative (www.opentrad.com), a government-
funded project shared among different universities 
and small companies, which also include MT en-
gines for translation among the main languages in 
Spain. The main objective of this initiative is the 
construction of an open, reusable and interoperable 
framework. 
In the OpenTrad project, two different but coor-
dinated designs have been carried out: 
? A shallow-transfer machine translation en-
gine for similar languages (Spanish, Catalan 
and Galician by the the time being). The 
MT architecture uses finite-state transducers 
for lexical processing, hidden Markov mod-
els for part-of-speech tagging, and chunking 
based on finite-state for structural transfer. 
It is named Apertium and it can be 
downloaded from apertium.sourceforge.net. 
(Armentano-Oller et al, 2004) 
? A deeper-transfer engine for the Spanish-
Basque pair. It is named Matxin (Alegria et 
al., 2007) and it is stored in 
matxin.sourceforge.net. It is an extension of 
previous work in our group. In order to re-
use resources in this Spanish-Basque system 
the analysis module for similar languages 
was not included in Matxin; another open 
source engine, FreeLing (Carreras et al, 
2004), was used here, of course, and its out-
put had to be converted to the proposed in-
terchange format. 
Some of the components (modules, data formats 
and compilers) from the first architecture in Open-
Trad were used in the second one. Indeed, an im-
portant additional goal of this work was testing 
which modules from the first architecture could be 
integrated in deeper-transfer architectures for more 
difficult language pairs. 
The transfer module is also based on three main 
objects in the translation process: words or nodes, 
chunks or phrases, and sentences.  
? First, lexical transfer is carried out using a 
bilingual dictionary compiled into a finite-
state transducer. We use the XML specifica-
tion of Apertium engine.  
? Then, structural transfer at the sentence 
level is applied, and some information is 
transferred from some chunks to others, and 
some chunks may disappear. Grammars 
based on regular expressions are used to 
specify these changes. For example, in the 
Spanish-Basque transfer, the person and 
number information of the object and the 
type of subordination are imported from 
other chunks to the chunk corresponding to 
the verb chain. 
? Finally the structural transfer at the chunk 
level is carried out. This process can be 
quite simple (e.g. noun chains between 
Spanish and Basque) or more complex (e.g. 
verb chains between these same languages). 
The XML file coming from the transfer module 
is passed on the generation module. 
? In the first step, syntactic generation is per-
formed in order to decide the order of 
chunks in the sentence and the order of 
words in the chunks. Several grammars are 
used for this purpose.  
? Morphological generation is carried out in 
the last step. In the generation of Basque, 
the main inflection is added to the last word 
in the phrase (in Basque: the declension 
case, the article and other features are added 
to the whole noun phrase at the end of the 
last word), but in verb chains other words 
need morphological generation. A previous 
morphological analyzer/generator for 
Basque (Alegria et al, 1996) has been 
adapted and transformed to the format used 
in Apertium. 
The results for the Spanish/Basque system using 
FreeLing and Matxin are promising. The quantita-
62
tive evaluation uses the open source evaluation 
tool IQMT and figures are given using Bleu and 
NIST measures (Gim?nez et al, 2005). An user 
based evaluation has been carried out too. 
3.2 The corpus-based approach 
The corpus-based approach has been carried out in 
collaboration with the National Center for Lan-
guage Technology in Dublin.  
The system exploits both EBMT and SMT tech-
niques to extract a dataset of aligned chunks. We 
conducted Basque to English and Spanish to 
Basque translation experiments, evaluated on a 
large corpus (270, 000 sentence pairs).  
Some tools have been reused for this purpose: 
? GIZA++: for word/morpheme alignment we 
used the GIZA++ statistical word alignment 
toolkit, and following the ?refined? method 
of (Och and Ney, 2003), extracted a set of 
high-quality word/ morpheme alignments 
from the original unidirectional alignment 
sets. These along with the extracted chunk 
alignments were passed to the translation 
decoder.                                         
? Pharaoh/Moses decoder: the decoder is also 
a hybrid system which integrates EBMT 
and SMT. It is capable of retrieving already 
translated sentences and also provides a 
wrapper around the PHARAOH SMT de-
coder (Koehn, 2004). 
? MaTrEx: the MATREX (Machine Transla-
tion using Examples) system used in our 
experiments is a data-driven MT engine, 
built following an extremely modular de-
sign. It consists of a number of extensible 
and re-implementable modules (Way and 
Gough, 2005). 
   For this engine, we reuse a toolkit to chunk the 
Basque sentences. After this processing stage, a 
sentence is treated as a sequence of morphemes, in 
which chunk boundaries are clearly visible. Mor-
phemes denoting morphosyntactic features are re-
placed by conventional symbolic strings. After 
some adaptation, the chunks obtained in this man-
ner are actually very comparable to the English 
chunks obtained with the marker-based chunker. 
The experimental results have shown that our 
system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 
approaches according to several common auto-
matic evaluation metrics: WER, Bleu and PER 
(Stroppa et al, 2006; Labaka et al, 2007). 
4 Conclusions 
A language that seeks to survive in the modern 
information society requires language technology 
products. "Minority" languages have to do a great 
effort to face this challenge. The Ixa group has 
been working since 1986 on adapting Basque to 
language technology, having developed several 
applications that are effective tools to promote the 
use of Basque. Now we are planning to define the 
BLARK for Basque (Krauwer, 2003).  
From our experience, we defend that research 
and development for a minority language should to 
be faced following these points: high standardiza-
tion,  reusing language foundations, tools, and ap-
plications, and their incremental design and devel-
opment. We know that any HLT project related to 
a less privileged language should follow those 
guidelines, but from our experience we know that 
in most cases they do not. We think that if Basque 
is now in an good position in HLT is because those 
guidelines have been applied even  when it was 
easier to define "toy" resources and tools useful to 
get good short term academic results, but not reus-
able in future developments.  
This strategy has been completely useful when 
we have created MT systems for Basque. Reusing 
previous works for Basque (that were defined fol-
lowing XML and TEI standards) and reusing other 
open-source tools have been the key to get satisfac-
tory results in a short time.  
Two results produced in the MT track are pub-
licly available:

the Spanish-Basque RBMT system

Learning Argument/Adjunct Distinction for Basque 
Abstract 
This paper presents experiments performed on 
lexical knowledge acquisition in the form of 
verbal argumental information. The system 
obtains the data from raw corpora after the 
application of a partial parser and statistical 
filters. We used two different statistical filters 
to acquire the argumental information: Mutual 
Information, and Fisher?s Exact test. 
Due to the characteristics of agglutinative 
languages like Basque, the usual classification 
of arguments in terms of their syntactic 
category (such as NP or PP) is not suitable. 
For that reason, the arguments will be 
classified in 48 different kinds of case 
markers, which makes the system fine grained 
if compared to equivalent systems that have 
been developed for other languages. 
This work addresses the problem of 
distinguishing arguments from adjuncts, this 
being one of the most significant sources of 
noise in subcategorization frame acquisition. 
Introduction 
In recent years a considerable effort has been done 
on the acquisition of lexical information. As 
several authors point out, this information is useful 
for a wide range of applications. For example, J. 
Carroll et al (1998) show how adding 
subcategorization information improves the 
performance of a parser. 
With this in mind our aim is to obtain a system 
that automatically discriminates between 
subcategorized elements of verbs (arguments) and 
non-subcategorized ones (adjuncts).  
We have evaluated our system in two ways: 
comparing the results to a gold standard and 
estimating the coverage over sentences in the 
corpus. The purpose was to find out which was the 
impact of each approach on this particular task. 
The two methods of evaluation yield significantly 
different results.  
Basque is the subject of this study. A language 
that, in contrast to languages like English, has 
limited resources in the form of digital corpora, 
computational lexicons, grammars or annotated 
treebanks. Therefore, any effort like the one 
presented here, oriented to create lexical resources, 
has to be driven to do as much automatic work as 
possible, minimizing development costs. 
The paper is divided into 4 sections. The first 
section is devoted to explain the theoretical 
motivations underlying the process. The second 
section is a description of the different stages of 
the system. The third section presents the results 
obtained. The fourth section is a review of 
previous work on automatic subcategorization 
acquisition. Finally, we present the main 
conclusions. 
1 The argument/adjunct distinction 
Talking about Subcategorization Frames (SCF), 
means talking about arguments. Many existing 
systems acquire directly a set of possible SCFs 
without any previous filtering of adjuncts. 
However, adjuncts are a substantial source of noise 
and therefore, in order to avoid this problem, our 
approach addresses the problem of the 
argument/adjunct distinction. 
The argument/adjunct distinction is probably 
one of the most unclear issues in linguistics. The 
distinction has being presented, for example, in the 
generativist tradition, in the following way: 
arguments are those elements participating in the 
event and adjuncts are those elements 
contextualizing or locating the event. 
This definition seems to be quite clear, but 
when we deal with concrete examples it is not the

case. For example, if we take two verbs, talk and 
play.  
a. Yesterday I talked with Mary. 
b. Yesterday I played soccer with Mary. 
Here Mary is a participant of the event in both 
cases, therefore under the given definition both 
would be arguments. But this is contradictory to 
what traditional views consider in practice. The 
PP, with Mary, is considered an argument of talk 
but not an argument of play. It is true that there are 
differences between both of them because playing 
does not require two participants (though it can 
have them), while talking (under the sense of 
communicating) seems to require two participants. 
Finer argument/adjunct distinction have also 
been proposed differentiating between basic 
arguments, pseudo-arguments and adjuncts. Basic 
arguments are those required by the verb. Pseudo-
arguments are those that even if they are not 
required by the verb, when appearing they extend 
the verbal semantics, for example, adding new 
participants. And finally adjuncts, which would be 
contextualizers of the event. The most radical view 
is to consider the argument/adjunct distinction as a 
continuum where the elements belonging to the 
extremes of this continuum can be easily classified 
as arguments or adjuncts. On the contrary, the 
elements belonging to the central part of the 
continuum can be easily misclassified. For further 
reference see C. Schutze (1995), J.M. Gawron 
(1986), C. Verspoor (1997), J. Grimshaw (1990), 
and N. Chomsky (1995). 
From the different diagnostics proposed in the 
literature some are quite consistent among various 
authors (R. Grishman et al 1994, C. Pollard and I. 
Sag 1987, C. Verspoor 1997). 
1) The Obligatoriness condition. When a verb 
demands obligatorily the appearance of an 
element, this element will be an argument. 
a. John put the book on the table 
b. *John put the book 
2) Frequency. Arguments of a verb occur more 
frequently with that verb than with the other 
verbs. 
a. I came from home (argument). 
b. I heard it from you (adjunct). 
3) Iterability: Several instances of the same 
adjunct can appear together with a verb, while 
several instances of an argument cannot appear 
with a verb. 
a. I saw you in Washington, in the 
Kenedy Center. 
b. *I saw Alice John (being John and 
Alice two persons) 
4) Relative order: Arguments tend to appear closer 
to the verb than adjuncts.  
a. I put the book on the table at three 
b. *I put at three the book on the 
table 
5) Implicational test:  Arguments are semantically 
implied, even when they are optional. 
   a. I came to your house (from x) 
  b. I heard that (from x) 
The third and fourth tests were not very useful 
to us. Iterability test is quite weak because it seems 
to rely more on some other semantic notions such 
as part/whole relation than in the argument/adjunct 
distinction. For example, sentence 3.a would be 
grammatical due to semantic plausibility. The 
Kennedy Center is a part of Washington, therefore 
to see somebody in the Kennedy Center and see 
him in Washington are not semantically 
incompatible, so it is plausible to say it. In the case 
of 3.b John is not a part of  Alice and therefore it is 
not plausible to see Alice John. But for example it 
is plausible to say I saw you the hand. The relative 
order test is difficult to apply on a language like 
Basque which is a free word order language.  
The first and fifth tests are robust enough to be 
useful in practice. But only the two first 
diagnostics can be captured statistically by the 
application of association measures like Mutual 
Information. We did not come out with any  
straightforward way to apply the fifth test 
computationally. 
Before talking about the different measures 
applied, we will present step by step the whole 
process we pursued for achieving the 
argument/adjunct distinction. 
2 The acquisition process  
Our starting point was a raw newspaper corpus 
from of 1,337,445 words, where there were 
instances of 1,412 verbs. From them, we selected 
640 verbs as statistically relevant because they 
appear in more than 10 sentences.  
As we said earlier, our goal was to distinguish 
arguments from adjuncts. When starting from raw 
corpus, like in this case, it is necessary to get 
instances of verbs together with their dependents 
(arguments and adjuncts). We obtained this 
information applying a partial parser (section 2.1) 
to the corpus. Once we had the dependents, 
statistical measures helped us deciding which were 
arguments and which were adjuncts (section 2.2). 
2.1 The parsing phase 
Aiming to obtain the data against which statistical 
filters will be applied, we analyzed the corpus 
using several available linguistic resources: 
? First, we performed morphological analysis of 
the corpus, based on two-level morphology (K. 
Koskenniemi 1983; I. Alegria et al 1996) and 
disambiguation using the Constraint Grammar 
formalism (Karlsson et al 1995, Aduriz et al 
1997).  
? Second, a shallow parser was applied (I. 
Aldezabal et al 2000), which recognizes basic 
syntactic units including noun phrases, 
prepositional phrases and several types of 
subordinate sentences. 
? The third step consisted in linking each verb 
and its dependents. Basque lacks a robust 
parser as in (T. Briscoe & J. Carroll 1997, D. 
Kawahara et al 2001) and, therefore, we used a 
finite state grammar to link the dependents 
(both arguments and adjuncts) with the verb (I. 
I. Aldezabal et al 2001). This grammar was 
developed using the Xerox Finite State Tool (L. 
Karttunen et al 1997). Figure 1 shows the 
result of the parsing phase. In this case, both 
commitative and inessive cases (PPs) are 
adjuncts, while the ergative NP is an argument. 
The linking of dependents to a verb is not 
trivial considering that Basque is a language 
with free order of constituents, and any element 
appearing between two verbs could be, in 
principle, dependent on any of them. Many 
problems must be taken into account, such as 
ambiguity and determination of clause 
boundaries, among others. We evaluated the 
accuracy up to this point, obtaining a precision 
over dependents of 87% and a recall of 66%. 
So the input data to the next phase was 
relatively noisy.  
2.2 The argument selection phase 
In the data resulting from the shallow parsing 
phase we counted up to 65 different cases (types of 
arguments, including postpositions and different 
types of suffixes). These are divided in two main 
groups: 
? 43 correspond to postpositions. Some of them 
can be directly mapped to English prepositions, 
but in many cases several Basque postpositions 
correspond to just one English preposition (see 
Table 1a.). This set alo contains postpositions 
1)? (a) [ EEBBetako lehendakariak] (b) [UEko 15 herrialdeetako merkataritza ministroekin] 
(c) [bazkaldu behar zuen] (d) [negoziazioen bilgunean] ? 
 
2) ? the president of the USA had to eat with the ministers of Commerce of 15 countries of the UE in
the negotiation center ?

Below (c) Verb phrase and (a,b,d) verbal dependents (phrases), and also under the case+head

bezala 
legez 
 
? 22 types of sentential complements (For 
instance, English that complementizer 
corresponds to several subordination suffixes:  
-la, -n, -na, -nik). 
This shows to which extent the range of 
arguments is fine grained, in contrast to other 
works where the range is at the categorial level, 
such as NP or PP (M. Brent 1993, C. Manning 
1993, P. Merlo & M. Leybold 2001). 
Due to the complexity carried by having such a 
high number of cases, we decided to gather 
postpositions that are semantically equivalent or 
almost equivalent (for example, English between 
and among). Even if there are some semantic 
differences between them they do not seem to be 
relevant at the syntactic level. Some linguists were 
in charge of completing this grouping task. Even 
considering the risk of making mistakes when 
grouping the cases, we concluded that the loss of 
accuracy due to having too sparse data 
(consequence of having many cases) would be 
worse than the noise introduced by any mistake in 
the grouping. The resulting set contained 48 cases. 
The complexity is reduced but it is still 
considerable.  
Most of the work on automatic acquisition of 
subcategorization information (J. Carroll & T. 
Briscoe 1997, A. Sarkar & D. Zeman 2000, A. 
Korhonen 2001) apply statistical methods 
(hypothesis testing). Basically the idea is the 
following: they get "possible subcategorization 
frames" from automatically parsed data (either 
completely or partially parsed) or from a 
syntactically annotated corpus. Afterwards a 
statistical filter is employed to decide whether 
those "possible frames" are or not real 
subcategorization frames. These statistical 
methods can be problematic mostly because they 
perform badly on sparse data. In order to avoid as 
much as possible data sparseness, we decided to 
design a system that learns which are the 
arguments of a given verb instead of learning 
whole frames. Frames are combinations of 
arguments, and considering that our system deals 
with 48 cases, the number of combinations was 
high, resulting in sparse data. So we decided to 
work at the level of the argument/adjunct 
distinction. Working on this distinction is also very 
useful to avoid noise in the subcategorization 
frame, because in this task adjuncts are synonyms 
of noise. A system that tries to get 
subcategorization frames without previously 
making the argument/adjunct distinction suffers of 
having sparse and noisy data.  
To accomplish the argument/adjunct distinction 
we applied two measures: Mutual Information 
(MI), and Fisher's Exact Test (for more 
information on these measures, see C. Manning & 
H. Sch?tze 1999). MI is a measure coming from 
Information Theory, defined as the logarithm of 
the ratio between the probability of the co-
occurrence of the verb and the case, and the 
probability of the verb and the case appearing 
together calculated from their independent 
probability. So higher Mutual Information values 
correspond to higher associated verb and cases 
(see table 2). 
Table 2. Examples from MI values for verb-case 
pairs 
verb case MI 
atera(to take/go out) ablative(from) 1.830 
atera(to take/go out) instrumental(with) -0.955 
erabili(to use) gisa(as) 2.255 
erabili(to use) instrumental(with) -0.783 
Mutual Information shows higher values for 
atera-ablative(to go/take out), erabili-gisa (to use-
as). These pairs were manually tagged as 
arguments, therefore Mutual information makes 
the right prediction. On the contrary, atera-
instrumental (to go/take out-with), erabili-
instrumental (to use-with) were manually tagged as 
adjuncts. Mutual information values in table 2 go 
along with the manual tagging for these last pairs 
as well, because the Mutual information values are 
low as should correspond to adjuncts.  
Fisher?s Exact Test is a hypothesis testing 
statistical measure1. We used the left-side version 
of the test (see T. Pederssen, 1996). Under this 
version the test tells us how likely it would be to 
perform the same experiment again and be less 
accurate. That is to say, if you were repeating the 
experiment and there were no relation between the 
verb and the case, you would have a big 
probability of finding a lower co-occurrence 
frequency than the one you observed in your 
experiment. So higher left-side Fisher values tell 
us that there is a correlation between the verb and 
the case (see table 3.) 
Table 3. Examples of Fisher?s Exact Test  values for 
verb-case pairs 
verb Case Fisher 
atera(to take/go out) Ablative(from) 1.0000 
atera(to take/go out) instrumental(with) 0.0003 
erabili(to use) gisa(as) 1.0000 
erabili(to use) instrumental(with) 0.0002 
Fisher?s Exact values show higher values for 
atera-ablative(to go/take out), erabili-gisa (to use-
as). These values predict correctly the association 
between the verbs and cases for these examples. 
The low values for the atera-instrumental (to 
go/take out-with), and erabili-instrumental (to use-
with) pairs, should be interpreted as the non-
association between the verbs and the cases in 
these examples, that is to say, they are adjuncts. 
And again, the prediction would be right according 
to the taggers. 
These tests are broadly used to discover 
associations between words, but they show 
different behaviour depending on the nature of the 
data. We did not want to make any a priori 
decision on the measure employed. On the 
contrary, we aimed to check which test behaved 
better on our data.  
3 Evaluation  
We found in the literature two main approaches to 
evaluate a system like the one proposed in this 
paper (T. Briscoe & J. Carroll 1997, A. Sarkar & 
D. Zeman 2000, A. Korhonen 2001): 
                                                     
1 There are two ways of interpreting Fisher?s test, as one 
or two sided test. In the one sided fashion there is still 
another interpretation, as a right or left sided test. 
 
? Comparing the obtained information with a 
gold standard.  
? Calculating the coverage of the obtained 
information on a corpus. This can give  an 
estimate of how well the information obtained 
could help a parser on that corpus. 
Under the former approach a further distinction 
emerges: using a dictionary as a gold standard, or 
performing manual evaluation, where some 
linguists extract the subcategorization frames 
appearing in a corpus and comparing them with the 
set of subcategorization frames obtained 
automatically.  
We decided to evaluate the system both ways, 
that is to say, using a gold standard and calculating 
the coverage over a corpus. The intention was to 
determine, all things being equal, the impact of 
doing it one way or the other. 
3.1 Evaluation 1: comparison of the results with a 
gold standard 
From the 640 analyzed verbs, we selected 10 for 
evaluation. For each of these verbs we extracted 
from the corpus the list of all their dependents. The 
list was a set of bare verb-case pairs, that is, no 
context was involved and, therefore, as the sense 
of the given verb could not be derived, different 
senses of the verb were taken into account.  We 
provided 4 human annotators/taggers with this list 
and they marked each dependent as either 
argument or adjunct. The taggers accomplished the 
task three times. Once, with the simple guideline 
of the implicational test and obligatoriness test, but 
with no further consensus. The inter-tagger 
agreement was low (57%). The taggers gathered 
and realized that the problem came mostly from 
semantics. While some taggers tagged the verb-
case pairs assuming a concrete semantic domain 
the others took into account a wider rage of senses 
(moreover, in some cases the senses did not even 
match). So the tagging was repeated when all of 
them considered the same semantics to the 
different verbs. The inter-tagger agreement raised 
up to a 80%. The taggers gathered again to discuss, 
deciding over the non clear pairs. 
The list obtained from merging2 the 4 lists in 
one is taken to be our gold standard. Notice that 
                                                     
2 Merging was possible once the annotators agreed on 
the marking of each element. 
when the annotators decided whether a possible 
argument was really an argument or not, no 
context was involved. In other words, they were 
deciding over bare pairs of verbs and cases. 
Therefore different senses of the verb were 
considered because there was no way to 
disambiguate the specific meaning of the verb. So 
the evaluation is an approximation of how well 
would the system perform over any corpus. Table 
4 shows the results in terms of Precision and 
Recall. 
Table 4. Results of Evaluation 1 (context 
independent) 
 Precision Recall F-score 
MI 62% 50% 55% 
Fisher 64% 44% 52% 
 
3.2 Evaluation 2: Calculation of the coverage on a 
corpus 
The initial corpus was divided in two parts, one for 
training the system and another one for evaluating 
it. From the fraction reserved for evaluation we 
extracted 200 sentences corresponding to the same 
10 verbs used in the "gold standard" based 
evaluation. In this case, the task carried out by the 
annotators consisted in extracting, for each of the 
200 sentences, the elements (arguments/adjuncts) 
linked to the corresponding verb. Each element 
was marked as argument or adjunct. Note that in 
this case the annotation takes place inside the 
context of the sentence. In other words, the verb 
shows precise semantics.  
We performed a simple evaluation on the 
sentences (see table 5), calculating precision and 
recall over each argument marked by the 
annotators3. For example, if a verb appeared in a 
sentence with two arguments and the statistical 
filters were recognizing them as arguments, both 
precision and recall would be 100%. If, on the 
contrary, only one was found, then precision 
would be 100%, and recall 50%.  
Table 5. Results of Evaluation 2 (inside context) 
 Precision Recall F-score 
MI 93% 97% 95% 
Fisher 93% 93% 93% 
                                                     
3 The inter-tagger agreement in this case was of  97%.  
3.3 Discussion 
It is obvious that the results attained in the first 
evaluation are different than those in the second 
one. The origin of this difference comes mostly, on 
one hand, from semantics and, on the other hand, 
from the nature of statistics: 
? Semantic source. The former evaluation was 
not contextualized, while the latter used the 
sentence context. Our experience showed us 
that broader semantics (non-contextualized 
evaluation) leads to a situation where the 
number of arguments increases with respect to 
narrower (contextualized evaluation) 
semantics. This happens because in many 
cases different senses of the same verb require 
different arguments. So when the meaning of 
the verb is not specified, different meanings 
have to be taken into account and, therefore, 
the task becomes more difficult. 
? Statistical reason. The disagreement in the 
results comes from the nature of the statistics 
themselves. Any statistical measure performs 
better on the most frequent cases than on the 
less frequent ones. In the first experiment all 
possible arguments are evaluated, including 
the less frequent ones, whereas in the second 
experiment only the possible arguments found 
in the piece of corpus used were evaluated. In 
most of the cases, the possible arguments 
found were the most frequent ones. 
At this point it is important to note that the 
system deals with non-structural cases. In Basque 
there are three structural cases (ergative, absolutive 
and dative) which are special because, when they 
appear, they are always arguments. They 
correspond to the subject, direct object and indirect 
object functions. These cases are not very 
conflictive about argumenthood, mainly because in 
Basque the auxiliary bears information about their 
appearance in the sentence. So they are easily 
recognized and linked to the corresponding verb. 
That is the reason for not including them in this 
work. Precision and recall would improve 
considerably if they were included because they 
are the most frequent cases (as statistics perform 
well over frequent data), and also because the 
shallow parser links them correctly using the 
information carried by the auxiliary. Notice that 
we did not incorporate them because in the future 
we would like to use the subcategorization  
information obtained for helping our parser, and 
the non-structural cases are the most problematic 
ones.    
4 Related work  
Concerning the acquisition of verb 
subcategorization information, there are proposals 
ranging from manual examination of corpora (R. 
Grishman et al 1994) to fully automatic 
approaches.  
Table 3, partially borrowed from A. Korhonen 
(2001), summarizes several systems on 
subcategorization frame acquisition. 
C. Manning (1993) presents the acquisition of 
subcategorization frames from unlabelled text 
corpora. He uses a stochastic tagger and a finite 
state parser to obtain instances of verbs with their 
adjacent elements (either arguments or adjuncts), 
and then a statistical filtering phase produces 
subcategorization frames (from a set of previously 
defined 19 frames) for each verb.  
T. Briscoe and J. Carroll (1997) describe a 
grammar based experiment for the extraction of 
subcategorization frames with their associated 
relative frequencies, obtaining 76.6% precision 
and 43.4% recall. Regarding evaluation, they use 
the ANLT and COMLEX Syntax dictionaries as 
gold standard. They also performed evaluation of 
coverage over a corpus. For our work, we could 
not make use of any previous information on 
subcategorization, because there is nothing like a  
subcategorization dictionary for Basque. 
A. Sarkar and D. Zeman (2000) report results 
on the automatic acquisition of subcategorization 
frames for verbs in Czech, a free word order 
language. The input to the system is a set of 
manually annotated sentences from a treebank, 
where each verb is linked with its dependents 
(without distinguishing arguments and adjuncts). 
The task consists in iteratively eliminating 
elements from the possible frames with the aim of 
removing adjuncts. For evaluation, they give an 
estimate of how many of the obtained frames 
appear in a set of 500 sentences where dependents 
were annotated manually, showing an 
improvement from a baseline of 57% (all elements 
are adjuncts) to 88%. 
Comparing this approach to our work, we must 
point out that Sarkar and Zeman's data does not 
come from raw corpus, and thus they do not deal 
with the problem of noise coming from the parsing 
phase. Their main limitation comes by relying on a 
treebank, which is an expensive resource. 
D. Kawahara et al (2001) use a full syntactic 
parser to obtain a case frame dictionary for 
Japanese, where arguments are distinguished by 
their syntactic case, including their headword 
(selectional restrictions). The resulting case frame 
components are selected by a frequency threshold.

M. Maragoudakis et al (2001) apply a 
morphological analyzer and phrase chunking 
module to acquire subcategorization frames for 
Modern Greek. In contrast to this work, they use 
different machine learning techniques. They claim 
that Bayesian Belief Networks are the best 
learning technique. 
P. Merlo and M. Leybold (2001) present 
learning experiments for automatic distinction of 
arguments and adjuncts, applied to the case of 
prepositional phrases attached to a verb. She uses 
decision trees tested on a set of 400 verb instances 
with a single PP, reaching an accuracy of 86.5% 
over a baseline of 74%. 
Note that both Manning and Merlo and 
Leybold's systems learn from contexts with just 
one PP (maximum) per verb (finite state filter). 
Our system learns from contexts with up to 5 PPs. 
Furthermore, we distinguish 48 different kinds of 
cases, hence the number of combinations is 
considerably bigger.  
Regarding the parsing phase, the systems 
presented so far are heterogeneous. While  
Manning, Merlo and Leybold and Maragoudakis et 
al. use very simple parsing techniques, Briscoe and 
Carroll and Kawahara et al use sophisticated 
parsers. Our system can be placed between these 
two approaches. The result of the shallow parsing 
is not simple in that it relies on a robust 
morphological analysis and disambiguation. 
Remember that Basque is an agglutinative 
language with strong morphology and, therefore, 
this stage is particularly relevant. Moreover, the 
finite state filter we used for parsing is very 
sophisticated (L. Karttunen et al 1997, I. 
Aldezabal et al 2001), compared to Manning's. 
Conclusion  
This work describes an initial effort to obtain 
subcategorization information for Basque. To 
successfully perform this task we had to go deeper 
than mere syntactic categories (NP, PP, ?) 
enriching the set of possible arguments to 48 
different classes. This leads to quite sparse data.  
Together with sparseness, another problem 
common to every subcategorization acquisition 
system is that of noise, coming from adjuncts and 
incorrectly parsed elements. For that reason, we 
defined subcategorization acquisition in terms of 
distinguishing between arguments and adjuncts. 
The system presented was applied to a 
newspaper corpus. Subcategorization acquisition is 
highly associated to semantics in that different 
senses of a verb will most of the times show 
different subcategorization information. Thus, the 
task of learning subcategorization information is 
influenced by the corpus. As for the evaluation of 
this work, we carried out two different kinds of 
evaluation. This way, we verified the relevance of 
semantics in this kind of task. 
For the future, we plan to incorporate the 
information resulting from this work in our parsing 
system. We hope that this will lead to better results 
in parsing. Consequently, we would get better 
subcategorization information, in a bootstrapping 
cycle. We also plan to improve the results by using 
semantic information as proposed in A. Korhonen 
(2001).
