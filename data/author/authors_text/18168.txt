Abstract
In some societies, internet users have to
create information morphs (e.g. ?Peace
West King? to refer to ?Bo Xilai?) to avoid
active censorship or achieve other com-
munication goals. In this paper we aim
to solve a new problem of resolving en-
tity morphs to their real targets. We ex-
ploit temporal constraints to collect cross-
source comparable corpora relevant to any
given morph query and identify target can-
didates. Then we propose various novel
similarity measurements including surface
features, meta-path based semantic fea-
tures and social correlation features and
combine them in a learning-to-rank frame-
work. Experimental results on Chinese
Sina Weibo data demonstrate that our ap-
proach is promising and significantly out-
performs baseline methods1.
1 Introduction
Language constantly evolves to maximize com-
municative success and expressive power in daily
social interactions. The proliferation of online so-
cial media significantly expedites this evolution,
as new phrases triggered by social events may be
disseminated rapidly in social media. To automati-
cally analyze such fast evolving language in social
media, new computational models are demanded.
In this paper, we focus on one particular lan-
guage evolution that creates new ways to commu-
nicate sensitive subjects because of the existence
of internet information censorship. We call this

oped in this work are made freely available for research pur-
pose at http://nlp.cs.qc.cuny.edu/Morphing.tar.gz
phenomenon information morph. For example,
when Chinese online users talk about the former
politician ?Bo Xilai?, they use a morph ?Peace
West King? instead, a historical figure four hun-
dreds years ago who governed the same region
as Bo. Morph can be considered as a special
case of alias used for hiding true entities in ma-
licious environment (Hsiung et al, 2005; Pantel,
2006). However, social network plays an impor-
tant role in generating morphs. Usually morphs
are generated by harvesting the collective wisdom
of the crowd to achieve certain communication
goals. Aside from the purpose of avoiding cen-
sorship, other motivations for using morph include
expressing sarcasm/irony, positive/negative senti-
ment or making descriptions more vivid toward
some entities or events. Table 1 presents the wide
range of cases that are used to create the morphs.
We can see that a morph can be either a regular
term with new meaning or a newly created term.

Table 1: Morph Examples and Motivations.
We believe that successful resolution of morphs
is a crucial step for automated understanding of
the fast evolving social media language, which
is important for social media marketing (Bar-
wise and Meehan, 2010). Another application
is to help common users without enough back-
ground/cultural knowledge to understand internet
language for their daily use. Furthermore, our ap-
proaches can also be applied for satire or other im-
plicit meaning recognition, as well as information
extraction (Bollegala et al, 2011).

However, morph resolution in social media is
challenging due to the following reasons. First,
the sensitive real targets that exist in the same
data source under active censorship are often au-
tomatically filtered. Table 2 presents the distribu-
tions of some examples of morphs and their tar-
gets in English Twitter and Chinese Sina Weibo.
For example, the target ?Chen Guangcheng? only
appears once in Weibo. Thus, the co-occurrence
of a morph and its target is quite low in the vast
amount of information in social media. Second,
most morphs were not created based on pronunci-
ations, spellings or other encryptions of their origi-
nal targets. Instead, they were created according to
semantically related entities in historical and cul-
tural narratives (e.g. ?Peace West King? as morph
of ?Bo Xilai?) and thus very difficult to capture
based on typical lexical features. Third, tweets
from Twitter/Chinese Weibo are short (only up to
140 characters) and noisy, resulting in difficult ex-
traction of rich and accurate evidences due to the
lack of enough contexts.

Table 2: Distributions of Morph Examples
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to use NLP and social network analysis tech-
niques to automatically resolve morphed informa-
tion. To address the above challenges, our paper
offers the following novel contributions.
? We detect target candidates by exploiting the
dynamics of the social media to extract tem-
poral distribution of entities, based on the as-
sumption that the popularity of an individ-
ual is correlated between censored and un-
censored text within a certain time window.
? Our approach builds and analyzes heteroge-
neous information networks from multiple
sources, such as Twitter, Sina Weibo and web
documents in formal genre (e.g. news) be-
cause a morph and its target tend to appear in
similar contexts.
? We propose two new similarity measures, as
well as integrating temporal information into
the similarity measures to generate global se-
mantic features.
? We model social user behaviors and use so-
cial correlation to assist in measuring seman-
tic similarities because the users who posted
a morph and its corresponding target tend to
share similar interests and opinions.
Our experiments demonstrate that the pro-
posed approach significantly outperforms tradi-
tional alias detection methods (Hsiung et al,
2005).

Figure 1: Overview of Morph Resolution
Given a morph query m, the goal of morph res-
olution is to find its real target. Figure 1 depicts
the general procedure of our approach. It consists
of two main sub-tasks:
? Target Candidate Identification: For each
m, discover a list of target candidates E =
{e1, e2, ..., eN}. First, relevant comparable
data sets that include m are retrieved. In
this paper we collect comparable censored
data from Weibo and uncensored data from
Twitter and Web documents such as news ar-
ticles. We then apply various annotations
such as word segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, noun phrase chunking, name tagging
and event extraction to these data sets.
? Target Candidate Ranking: Rank the target
candidates in E. We explore various features
including surface, semantic and social fea-
tures, and incorporate them into a learning to
1084
rank framework. Finally, the top ranked can-
didate is produced as the resolved target.
3 Target Candidate Identification
The general goal of the first step is to identify a list
of target candidates for each morph query from the
comparable corpora including Sina Weibo, Chi-
nese News websites and English Twitter. How-
ever, obviously we cannot consider all of the
named entities in these sources as target candi-
dates due to the sheer volume of information. In
addition, morphs are not limited to named entity
forms. In order to narrow down the scope of tar-
get candidates, we propose a Temporal Distribu-
tion Assumption as follows. The intuition is that
a morph m and its real target e should have sim-
ilar temporal distributions in terms of their occur-
rences. Suppose the data sets are separated into Z
temporal slots (e.g. by day), the assumption can
be stated as:
Let Tm = {tm1, tm2, ..., tmZm} be the set of
temporal slots each morph m occurs, and Te =
{te1, te2, ..., teZe} be the set of slots a target can-
didate e occurs. Then e is considered as a target
candidate of m if and only if, for each tmi ? Tm
(i = 1, 2, ..., Zm), there exist a j ? {1, 2, ..., Ze}
such that tmi ? tej ? ?, where ? is a threshold
value (in this paper we set the threshold to 7 days,
which is optimized from a development set). For
comparison we also attempted topic modeling ap-
proach to detect target candidates, as shown in sec-
tion 5.3.
4 Target Candidate Ranking
Next, we propose a learning-to-rank framework to
rank target candidates based on various levels of
novel features based on surface, semantic and so-
cial analysis.
4.1 Surface Features
We first extract surface features between the
morph and the candidate based on measuring or-
thographic similarity measures which were com-
monly used in entity coreference resolution (e.g.
(Ng, 2010; Hsiung et al, 2005)). The measures
we use include ?string edit distance?, ?normalized
string edit distance? (Wagner and Fischer, 1974)
and ?longest common subsequence? (Hirschberg,
1977).
4.2 Semantic Features
4.2.1 Motivations
Fortunately, although a morph and its target may
have very different orthographic forms, they tend
to be embedded in similar semantic contexts
which involve similar topics and events. Figure 2
presents some example messages under censor-
ship (Weibo) and not under censorship (Twitter
and Chinese Daily). We can see that they include
similar topics, events (e.g., ?fell from power?,
?gang crackdown?, ?sing red songs?), and se-
mantic relations (e.g., family relations with ?Bo
Guagua?). Therefore if we can automatically ex-
tract and exploit these indicative semantic con-
texts, we can narrow down the real targets effec-
tively.

4.2.2 Information Network Construction
We define an information network as a directed
graph G = (V, E) with an object type mapping
function ? : V ? A and a link type mapping func-
tion ? : E ? R, where each object v ? V belongs
to one particular object type ?(v) ? A, each link
e ? E belongs to a particular relation ?(e) ? R.
If two links belong to the same relation type, then
they share the same starting object type as well as
the same ending object type. An information net-
work is homogeneous if and only if there is only
one type for both objects and links, and an infor-
mation network is heterogeneous when the objects
are from multiple distinct types or there exist more
than one type of links.
In order to construct the information networks
for morphs, we apply the Standford Chinese word
1085
segmenter with Chinese Penn Treebank segmen-
tation standard (Chang et al, 2008) and Stan-
ford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003)
to process each sentence in the comparable data
sets. Then we apply a hierarchical Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) based Chinese lexical analyzer
ICTCLAS (Zhang et al, 2003) to extract named
entities, noun phrases and events.
We have also attempted using the results from
Dependency Parsing, Relation Extraction and
Event Extraction tools (Ji and Grishman, 2008)
to enrich the link types. Unfortunately the state-
of-the-art techniques for these tasks still perform
poorly on social media in terms of both accuracy
and coverage of important information, these so-
phisticated semantic links all produced negative
impact on the target ranking performance. There-
fore we limited the types of vertices into: Morph
(M), Entity(E), which includes target candidates,
Event (EV), and Non-Entity Noun Phrases (NP);
and used co-occurrence as the edge type. We ex-
tract entities, events, and non-entity noun phrases
that occur in more than one tweet as neighbors.
And for two vertices xi and xj , the weight wij
of their edge is the frequency they co-occur to-
gether within the tweets. A network schema of
such networks is shown in Figure 3. Figure 4

Figure 3: Network Schema of Morph-Related Het-
erogeneous Information Network
presents an example of a heterogeneous informa-
tion network from the motivation examples fol-
lowing the above network schema, which connects
the morphs ?Peace West King?, ?Buhou? and their
corresponding target ?Bo Xilai?.
4.2.3 Meta-Path-Based Semantic Similarity
Measurements
Given the constructed network, a straightforward
solution for finding the target for a morph is to use
link-based similarity search. However, now ob-
jects are linked to different types of neighbors, if
all neighbors are treated as the same, it may cause
information loss problems. For example, the en-
tity ??? (Chongqing)? is a very important aspect
characterizing the politician ????(Bo Xilai)?

Figure 4: Example of Morph-Related Heteroge-
neous Information Network
since he governed it, and if a morph m which is
also highly correlated with ??? (Chongqing)?, it
is very likely that ?Bo Xilai? is the real target ofm.
Therefore, the semantic features generated from
neighbors such as the entity ??? (Chongqing)?
should be treated differently from other types of
neighbors such as ???(talented people)? .
In this work, we propose to measure the simi-
larity of two nodes over heterogeneous networks
as shown in Figure 3, by distinguishing neighbors
into three types according to the network schema
(i.e. entities, events, non-entity noun phrases). We
then adopt meta-path-based similarity measures
(Sun et al, 2011a; Sun et al, 2011b), which are
defined over heterogeneous networks to extract se-
mantic features. A meta-path is a path defined over
a network, and composed of a sequence of rela-
tions between different object types. For example,
as shown in Figure 3, a morph and its target can-
didate can be connected by three meta-paths, in-
cluding ?M - E - E?, ?M - EV - E?, and ?M - NP
- E?. Intuitively, each meta-path provides a unique
angle to measure how similar two objects are.
For the determined meta-paths, we extract se-
mantic features using the similarity measures pro-
posed in (Sun et al, 2011a; Hsiung et al, 2005).
We denote the neighbor sets of certain type for a
morph m and a target candidate e as ?(m) and
?(e), and a meta-path as P . We now list several
meta-path-based similarity measures below.
Common neighbors (CN). It measures the num-
ber of common neighbors that m and e share as
|?(m) ? ?(e)|.
Path count (PC). It measures the number of path
instances betweenm and e following meta-pathP .
Pairwise random walk (PRW). For a meta-
path P that can be decomposed into two shorter
1086
meta-paths with the same length P = (P1P2),
pairwise random walk measures the probabil-
ity of the pairwise random walk starting from
both m and e and reaching the same mid-
dle object. More formally, it is computed as?
(p1p2)?(P1P2) prob(p1)prob(p?12 ), where p?12 isthe inverse of p2.
Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD). For m and
e, the pairwise random walk probability of their
neighbors can be represented as two probability
vectors, then Kullback-Leibler distance (Hsiung
et al, 2005) can be used to compute sim(m, e).
Beyond the above similarity measures, we also
propose to use cosine-similarity-style normaliza-
tion method to modify common neighbor and pair-
wise random walk measures so that we can ensure
the morph node and the target candidate node are
strongly connected and also have similar popular-
ity. The modified algorithms penalize features in-
volved with the highly popular objects, since they
are more likely to have accidental interactions with
each other.
Normalized common neighbors (NCN). Nor-
malized common neighbors can be measured as
sim(m, e) = |?(m)??(e)|?
|?(m)|
?
|?(e)|
. It refines the simple
counting of common neighbors by avoiding bias
to highly visible or concentrated objects.
Pairwise random walk/cosine (PRW/cosine).
Pairwise random walk measures linkage weights
disproportionately with their visibility to their
neighbors, which may be too strong. Instead, we
propose to use a tamer normalization method as?
(p1p2)?(P1P2) f(p1)f(p?12 ), where.
f(p1) = count(m,x)??
x?? count(m,x)
,
f(p2) = count(e, x)??
x?? count(e, x)
,
and ? is the set of middle objects connecting the
decomposed meta-paths p1 and p?12 , count(y, x)
is the total number of paths between y and the mid-
dle object x, y could be m or e.
The above similarity measures can also be ap-
plied to homogeneous networks that do not differ-
entiate the neighbor types.
4.2.4 Global Semantic Feafure Generation
A morph tends to have higher temporal correlation
with its real target, and share more similar topics
compared to other irrelevant targets. Therefore,
we propose to incorporate temporal information
into similarity measures to generate global seman-
tic features.
Let T = t1 ? t2 ? ... ? tN be a set of temporal
slots (i.e. by day),E be the set of target candidates
for each morphm. Then for each ti ? T , and each
e ? E, the local semantic features simti(m, e)
is extracted based only on the information posted
within ti using one of the similarity measures in-
troduced in Section 4.2.3. Then we propose two
approaches to generate global semantic features.
The first approach is adding the similarity score
between m and e in each temporal slot to attain
the first set of global features:
simglobal sum(m, e) =
?
ti?T
simti(m, e).
The second method first normalizes the similarity
score in each temporal slot ti, them sum the nor-
malized scores to generate the second set of global
features, which can be calculated as
simglobal norm(m, e) =
?
ti?T
normti(m, e).
where normti(m, e) = simti (m,e)?e?E simti (m,e) .
4.2.5 Integrate Cross Source/Cross Genre
Information
Due to internet information censorship or surveil-
lance, users may need to use morphs to post sensi-
tive information. For example, the Chinese Weibo
message ?????,??????? (Already
put in prison, still need to serve Buhou?? include
a morph ?? (Buhou). In contrast, users are less
restricted in some other uncensored social media
such as Twitter. For example, the tweet from Twit-
ter ?...?????????????????...
(...call Bo Xilai?peace west king? or ?buhou?...)?
contains both the morph and the real target ??
? (Bo Xilai). Therefore, we propose to integrate
information from another source (e.g. Twitter) to
help resolution of sensitive morphs in Weibo.
Another difficulty from morph resolution in
micro-blogging is that tweets are only allowed to
contain maximum 140 characters with a lot of
noise and diverse topics. The shortness and di-
versity of tweets may limit the power of content
analysis for semantic feature extraction. However,
formal genres such as web documents are cleaner
and contain richer contexts, thus can provide more
topically related information. In this work, we also
exploit the background web documents from the
1087
embedded URLs in tweets to enrich information
network construction. After applying the same an-
notation techniques as tweets for uncensored data
sets, sentence-level co-occurrence relations are ex-
tracted and integrated into the network as shown in
Figure 3.
4.3 Social Features
It has been shown that there exist correlation be-
tween neighbors in social networks (Anagnos-
topoulos et al, 2008; Wen and Lin, 2010). Be-
cause of such social correlation, close social
neighbors in social media such as Twitter and
Weibo may post similar information, or share sim-
ilar opinion. Therefore, we can utilize social cor-
relation to assist in resolving morphs.
As social correlation can be defined as a func-
tion of social distance between a pair of users, we
use social distance as a proxy to social correla-
tion in our approach. The social distance between
user i and j is defined by considering the degree
of separation in their interaction (e.g. retweet-
ing and mentioning) and the amount of the in-
teraction. Similar definition has been shown ef-
fective in characterizing social distance in social
networks extracted from communication data (Lin
et al, 2012; Wen and Lin, 2010). Specifically,
it is dist(i, j) = ?K?1k=1 1strength(vk,vk+1) , where
v1, ..., vk are the nodes on the shortest path from
user i to user j, and strength(vk, vk+1) measures
the strength of interactions between vk and vk+1
as: strength(i, j) = log(Xij)maxj log(Xij) , where Xij isthe total interactions between user i and j, includ-
ing both retweeting and mentioning (If Xij < 10,
we set strength(i, j) = 0).
We integrate social correlation and temporal in-
formation to define our social features. The in-
tuition is that when a morph is used by an user,
the real target may also in the posts by the user or
his/her close friends within a certain time period.
Let T be the set of temporal slots a morph m oc-
curs, Ut be the set of users whose posts include m
in slot t where t ? T , and Uc be the set of close
friends (i.e., social distance < 0.5) for Ut. The
social features are defined as
s(m, e) =
?
t?T f(e, t, Ut, Uc)
|T | .
where f(e, t, Ut, Uc) is a indicator function which
return 1 if one of the users in Ut or Uc posts tweets
include the target candidate e within 7 days before
t.
4.4 Learning-to-Rank
Similar to (Hsiung et al, 2005; Sun et al, 2011a),
we then model the probability of linkage predic-
tion between a morph m and its target candidate
e as a function incorporating the surface, semantic
and social features. Given a training pair ?m, e?,
we choose the standard logistic regression model
to learn weights for the features defined above.
The learnt model is used to predict the probabil-
ity of linking an unseen morph and its target can-
didate. Based on the descending ranking order of
the probability, we select top k candidates as the
final answers based on the answer size k.
5 Experiments
Next, we present the experiment under various set-
tings shown in Table 3, and the impacts of cross
source and cross genre information.
5.1 Data and Evaluation Metric
We collected 1, 553, 347 tweets from Chinese Sina
Weibo from May 1 to June 30 to construct the
censored data set, and retrieved 66, 559 web doc-
uments from the embedded URLs in tweets as the
initial uncensored data set. Retweets and redun-
dant web documents are filtered to ensure more
reliable frequency counting of co-occurrence rela-
tions. We asked two native Chinese annotators to
analyze the data, and construct a test set consisted
of 107 morph entities (81 persons and 26 loca-
tions) and their real targets as our references. We
verified the references by Web resources includ-
ing the summary of popular morphs in Wikipedia
2. In addition, we used 23 sensitive morphs and
the entities that appear in the tweets as queries and
retrieved 25, 128 Chinese tweets from 10% Twit-
ter feeds within the same time period, as well as
7, 473 web documents from the embedded URLs
and added them into the uncensored data set.
To evaluate the system performance, we use
leave-one-out cross validation by computing ac-
curacy as Acc@k = CkQ , where Ck is the to-tal number of correctly resolved morphs at top
k ranked answers, and Q is the total number of
morph queries. We consider a morph as correctly
resolved at the top k answers if the top k answer
set contains the real target of the morph.

5.2 Resolution Performance
5.2.1 Single Genre Information
We first study the contributions of each set of sur-
face and semantic features, as shown in the first
five rows in Table 4. The poor performance based
on surface features shows that morph resolution
task is very challenging since 70% of morphs are
not orthographically similar to their real targets.
Thus, capturing a morph?s semantic meaning is
crucial. Overall, the results demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our proposed methods. Specifi-
cally, comparing ?HomB? and ?HetB?, ?HomE?
and ?HetE?, we can see that the semantic fea-
tures based on heterogeneous networks have ad-
vantages over those based on homogeneous net-
works. This corroborates that different neighbor
sets contribute differently, and such discrepancies
should be captured. And comparisions of ?HomB?
and ?HomE?, ?HetB? and ?HetE?demonstrate the
effectiveness of our two new proposed measures.
To evaluate the importance of each similarity mea-
sures, we delete the semantic features obtained
from each measure in ?HetE? and re-evaluate the
system. We find that NCN is the most effective
measure, while KLD is the least important one.
Further adding the global semantic features signif-
icantly improves the performance. This indicates
that capturing both temporal correlations and se-
mantics of morphing simultaneously are important
for morph resolution.
Table 5 shows that combination of surface and
semantic features further improves the perfor-
mance, showing that they are complementary. For
example, using only surface features, the real tar-
get ?????Steve Jobs?? of the morph ???
? (Qiao Boss)? is not top ranked since some other
candidates such as ??? (George)? are more or-
thographically similar. However, ?Steve Jobs? is
ranked top when combined with semantic features.

5.2.2 Cross Source and Cross Genre
Information
We integrate the cross source information from
Twitter, and the cross genre information from web
documents into Weibo tweets for information net-
work construction, and extract a new set of se-
mantic features. Table 6 shows that further gains
can be achieved. Notice that integrating tweets
from Twitter mainly improves the ranking for top
k where k > 1. This is because Weibo dominates
our dataset, and in Weibo many of these sensi-
tive morphs are mostly used with their traditional
meanings instead of the morph senses. Further
performance improvement is achieved by integrat-
ing information from background formal web doc-
uments which can provide richer context and rela-
tions.

5.2.3 Effects of Social Features
Table 7 shows that adding social features can im-
prove the best performance achieved so far. This is
because a group of people with close relationships
may share similar opinion. As an example, two
tweets ?...of course the reputation of Buhou is a
little too high! //@User1: //@User2: Chongqing
event tells us...)? and ?...do not follow Bo Xi-
lai...@User1...) are from two users in the same
social group.One includes a morph ?Buhou? and
the other includes its target ?Bo Xilai?.

5.3 Effects of Candidate Detection
The performance with and without candidate de-
tection step (using all features) is shown in Ta-
ble 8. The gain is small since the combination
of all features in the learning to rank framework
can already well capture the relationship between
a morph and a target candidate. Nevertheless, the
temporal distribution assumption is effective. It
helps to filter out 80% of unrelated targets and
speed up the system 5 times, while retain 98.5%
of the morph candidates that can be detected.

Table 8: The Effects of Temporal Constraint
We also attempted using topic modeling ap-
proach to detect target candidates. Due to the large
amount of data, we first split the data set on a daily
basis, then applied Probabilistic Latent Semantic
Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999). Named enti-
ties which co-occur at least ? times with a morph
query in the same topic are selected as its target
candidates. As shown in Table9 (K is the num-
ber of predefined topics), PLSA is not quite effec-
tive mainly because traditional topic modeling ap-
proaches do not perform well on short texts from
social media. Therefore, in this paper we choose
a simple method based on temporal distribution to
detect target candidates.

5.4 Discussions
Compared with the standard alias detection
(?Surf+HomB?) approach (Hsiung et al, 2005),
our proposed approach achieves significantly bet-
ter performance (99.9% confidence level by the
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test for
Acc@1). We further explore two types of factors
which may affect the system performance as fol-
lows.
One important aspect affecting the resolution
performance is the morph & non-morph ambigu-
ity. We categorize a morph query as ?Unique? if
the string is mainly used as a morph when it oc-
curs, such as ??? (Bodu)? which is used to re-
fer to ?Bo Xilai?; otherwise as ?Common? (e.g.
??? (Baby)? ,??? (President)? ). Table 10
presents the separate scores for these two cate-
gories. We can see that the morphs in ?Unique?
1090
category have much better resolution performance
than those in ?Common? category.
Category Number Acc@1 Acc@5 Acc@10 Acc@20
Unique 72 0.479 0.715 0.771 0.819
Common 35 0.171 0.343 0.40 0.429
Table 10: Performance of Two Categories
We also investigate the effects of popularity of
morphs on the resolution performance. We split
the queries into 5 bins with equal size based on the
non-descending frequency, and evaluate Acc@1
separately. As shown in Table11, we can see that
the popularity is not highly correlated with the per-
formance.

6 Related Work
To analyze social media behavior under active
censorship, (Bamman et al, 2012) automatically
discovered politically sensitive terms from Chi-
nese tweets based on message deletion analysis.
In contrast, our work goes beyond target idendi-
fication by resolving implicit morphs to their real
targets.
Our work is closely related to alias detec-
tion (Hsiung et al, 2005; Pantel, 2006; Bollegala
et al, 2011; Holzer et al, 2005). We demon-
strated that state-of-the-art alias detection meth-
ods did not perform well on morph resolution. In
this paper we exploit cross-genre information and
social correlation to measure semantic similarity.
(Yang et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2012) also showed
the effectiveness of exploiting information from
formal web documents to enhance tweet summa-
rization and tweet ranking.
Other similar research lines are the TAC-KBP
Entity Linking (EL) (Ji et al, 2010; Ji et al, 2011),
which links a named entity in news and web docu-
ments to an appropriate knowledge base (KB) en-
try, the task of mining name translation pairs from
comparable corpora (Udupa et al, 2009; Ji, 2009;
Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng,
2004; Hassan et al, 2007) and the link predic-
tion problem (Adamic and Adar, 2001; Liben-
Nowell and Kleinberg, 2003; Sun et al, 2011b;
Hasan et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2007; Sun et al,
2011a). Most of the work focused on unstruc-
tured or structured data with clean and rich re-
lations (e.g. DBLP). In contrast, our work con-
structs heterogeneous information networks from
unstructured, noisy multi-genre text without ex-
plicit entity attributes.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
of resolving implicit information morphs from the
data under active censorship. Our promising re-
sults can well serve as a benchmark for this new
problem. Both of the Meta-path based and so-
cial correlation based semantic similarity mea-
surements are proven powerful and complemen-
tary.
In this paper we have focused on entity morphs.
In the future we will extend our method to dis-
cover other types of information morphs, such as
events and nominal mentions. In addition, auto-
matic identification of candidate morphs is another
challenging task, especially when the mentions are
ambiguous and can also refer to other real enti-
ties. Our ongoing work includes identifying can-
didate morphs from scratch, as well as discovering
morphs for a given target based on anomaly anal-
ysis and textual coherence modeling.

Abstract
Internet users are keen on creating differ-
ent kinds of morphs to avoid censorship,
express strong sentiment or humor. For
example, in Chinese social media, users
often use the entity morph ???? (In-
stant Noodles)? to refer to ???? (Zhou
Yongkang)? because it shares one char-
acter ?? (Kang)? with the well-known
brand of instant noodles ???? (Master
Kang)?. We developed a wide variety of
novel approaches to automatically encode
proper and interesting morphs, which can
effectively pass decoding tests
1
.
1 Introduction
One of the most innovative linguistic forms in so-
cial media is Information Morph (Huang et al,
2013). Morph is a special case of alias to hide the
original objects (e.g., sensitive entities and events)
for different purposes, including avoiding censor-
ship (Bamman et al, 2012; Chen et al, 2013),
expressing strong sentiment, emotion or sarcasm,
and making descriptions more vivid. Morphs are
widely used in Chinese social media. Here is an
example morphs: ?????????????
????. (Because of Gua Dad?s issue, Instant
Noodles faces down with Antenna.)?, where
? ??? (Gua Dad)? refers to ???? (Bo Xilai)?
because it shares one character ?? (Gua)? with
???? (Bo Guagua)? who is the son of ???
? (Bo Xilai)?;
? ???? (Instant Noodles)? refers to ????
(Zhou Yongkang)? because it shares one char-
acter ?? (kang)? with the well-known instant
noodles brand ???? (Master Kang)?;
1
The morphing data set is available for research purposes:
http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/data/morphencoding.tar.gz
? ??? (Antenna)? refers to ???? (Wen Ji-
abao)? because it shares one character ??
(baby)? with the famous children?s television
series ????? (Teletubbies)?;
In contrast with covert or subliminal chan-
nels studied extensively in cryptography and se-
curity, Morphing provides confidentiality against
a weaker adversary which has to make a real time
or near real time decision whether or not to block
a morph within a time interval t. It will take longer
than the duration t for a morph decoder to decide
which encoding method is used and exactly how it
is used; otherwise adversary can create a codebook
and decode the morphs with a simple look up.
We note that there are other distinct characteristics
of morphs that make them different from crypto-
graphic constructs: (1) Morphing can be consid-
ered as a way of using natural language to com-
municate confidential information without encryp-
tion. Most morphs are encoded based on seman-
tic meaning and background knowledge instead
of lexical changes, so they are closer to Jargon.
(2) There can be multiple morphs for an entity.
(3) The Shannon?s Maxim ?the enemy knows the
system? does not always hold. There is no com-
mon code-book or secret key between the sender
and the receiver of a morph. (4) Social networks
play an important role in creating morphs. One
main purpose of encoding morphs is to dissemi-
nate them widely so they can become part of the
new Internet language. Therefore morphs should
be interesting, fun, intuitive and easy to remem-
ber. (5) Morphs rapidly evolve over time, as some
morphs are discovered and blocked by censorship
and newly created morphs emerge.
We propose a brand new and challenging re-
search problem - can we automatically encode
morphs for any given entity to help users commu-
nicate in an appropriate and fun way?
706
2 Approaches
2.1 Motivation from Human Approaches
Let?s start from taking a close look at human?s
intentions and general methods to create morphs
from a social cognitive perspective. In Table 1
and Table 2, we summarize 548 randomly selected
morphs into different categories. In this paper we
automate the first seven human approaches, with-
out investigating the most challenging Method 8,
which requires deep mining of rich background
and tracking all events involving the entities.
2.2 M1: Phonetic Substitution
Given an entity name e, we obtain its pho-
netic transcription pinyin(e). Similarly, for each
unique term t extracted from Tsinghua Weibo
dataset (Zhang et al, 2013) with one billion
tweets from 1.8 million users from 8/28/2012 to
9/29/2012, we obtain pinyin(t). According to the
Chinese phonetic transcription articulation man-
ner
2
, the pairs (b, p), (d, t), (g,k), (z,c), (zh,ch),
( j,q), (sh,r), (x,h), (l,n), (c,ch), (s,sh) and (z,zh)
are mutually transformable.
If a part of pinyin(e) and pinyin(t) are identi-
cal or their initials are transformable, we substi-
tute the part of e with t to form a new morph.
For example, we can substitute the characters of
??? ?? (Bill Gates) [Bi Er Gai Ci]? with
??? (Nose and ear) [Bi Er]? and ??? (Lid)
[Gai Zi]? to form new morph ??? ?? (Nose
and ear Lid) [Bi Er Gai Zi]?. We rank the candi-
dates based on the following two criteria: (1) If the
morph includes more negative words (based on a
gazetteer including 11,729 negative words derived
from HowNet (Dong and Dong, 1999), it?s more
humorous (Valitutti et al, 2013). (2) If the morph
includes rarer terms with low frequency, it is more
interesting (Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).
2.3 M2: Spelling Decomposition
Chinese characters are ideograms, hieroglyphs
and mostly picture-based. It allows us to natu-
rally construct a virtually infinite range of combi-
nations from a finite set of basic units - radicals (Li
and Zhou, 2007). Some of these radicals them-
selves are also characters. For a given entity name
e = c
1
...c
n
, if any character c
k
can be decomposed
into two radicals c
1
k
and c
2
k
which are both char-
acters or can be converted into characters based
on their pictograms (e.g., the radical ??? can be
2
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Initials and finals
converted into??? (grass) ), we create a morph by
replacing c
k
with c
1
k
c
2
k
in e. Here we use a charac-
ter to radical mapping table that includes 191 rad-
icals (59 of them are characters) and 1328 com-
mon characters. For example, we create a morph
???? (Person Dumb Luo)? for ??? (Paul)?
by decomposing ?? (Pau-)? into ?? (Person)?
and ?? (Dull)?. A natural alternative is to com-
posing two chracter radicals in an entity name to
form a morph. However, very few Chinese names
include two characters with single radicals.
2.4 M3: Nickname Generation
We propose a simple method to create morphs by
duplicating the last character of an entity?s first
name. For example, we create a morph ???
(Mimi)? to refer to ??? (Yang Mi)?.
2.5 M4: Translation and Transliteration
Given an entity e, we search its English translation
EN(e) based on 94,015 name translation pairs (Ji
et al, 2009). Then, if any name component in
EN(e) is a common English word, we search for
its Chinese translation based on a 94,966 word
translation pairs (Zens and Ney, 2004), and use the
Chinese translation to replace the corresponding
characters in e. For example, we create a morph
??? ?? (Larry bird)? for ??? ?? (Larry
Bird)? by replacing the last name ??? (Bird)?
with its Chinese translation ??? (bird)?.
2.6 M5: Semantic Interpretation
For each character c
k
in the first name of a given
entity name e, we search its semantic interpreta-
tion sentence from the Xinhua Chinese character
dictionary including 20,894 entries
3
. If a word
in the sentence contains c
k
, we append the word
with the last name of e to form a new morph. Sim-
ilarly to M1, we prefer positive, negative or rare
words. For example, we create a morph ????
(Bo Mess)? for ???? (Bo Xi Lai)? because the
semantic interpretation sentence for ?? (Lai)? in-
cludes a negative word ??? (Mess)?.
2.7 M6: Historical Figure Mapping
We collect a set of 38 famous historical figures
including politicians, emperors, poets, generals,
ministers and scholars from a website. For a given
entity name e, we rank these candidates by ap-
plying the resolution approach as described in our
previous work (Huang et al, 2013) to measure the
similarity between an entity and a historic figure

this approach generates a morph ??? (the First
Emperor)? for ???? (Mao Zedong)? who is the
first chairman of P. R. China and ??? (the Sec-
ond Emperor )? for ???? (Deng Xiaoping )?
who succeeded Mao.
2.8 M7: Characteristics Modeling
Finally, we propose a novel approach to auto-
matically generate an entity?s characteristics using
Google word2vec model (Mikolov et al, 2013).
To make the vocabulary model as general as pos-
sible, we use all of the following large corpora
that we have access to: Tsinghua Weibo dataset,
Chinese Gigaword fifth edition
4
which includes
10 million news documents, TAC-KBP 2009-2013
Source Corpora (McNamee and Dang, 2009; Ji et
4
http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T13
al., 2010; Ji et al, 2011; Ji and Grishman, 2011)
which include 3 million news and web documents,
and DARPA BOLT program?s discussion forum
corpora with 300k threads. Given an entity e, we
compute the semantic relationship between e and
each word from these corpora. We then rank the
words by: (1) cosine similarity, (2) the same cri-
teria as in section 2.6. Finally we append the top
ranking word to the entity?s last name to obtain
a new morph. Using this method, we are able
to generate many vivid morphs such as ?? ??
(Yao Wizard)? for ??? (Yao Ming)?.
3 Experiments
3.1 Data
We collected 1,553,347 tweets from Chinese Sina
Weibo from May 1 to June 30, 2013. We extracted
708
187 human created morphs based on M1-M7 for
55 person entities. Our approach generated 382
new morphs in total.
3.2 Human Evaluation
We randomly asked 9 Chinese native speakers
who regularly access Chinese social media and are
not involved in this work to conduct evaluation in-
dependently. We designed the following three cri-
teria based on Table 1:
? Perceivability: Who does this morph refer to?
(i) Pretty sure, (ii) Not sure, and (iii) No clues.
? Funniness: How interesting is the morph? (i)
Funny, (ii) Somewhat funny, and (iii) Not funny.
? Appropriateness: Does the morph describe the
target entity appropriately? (i) Make sense, (ii)
Make a little sense, and (iii) Make no sense.
The three choices of each criteria account for
100% (i), 50% (ii) and 0% (iii) satisfaction rate,
respectively. If the assessor correctly predicts the
target entity with the Perceivability measure, (s)he
is asked to continue to answer the Funniness and
Appropriateness questions; otherwise the Funni-
ness and Appropriateness scores are 0. The hu-
man evaluation results are shown in Table 4. The
Fleiss?s kappa coefficient among all the human as-
sessors is 0.147 indicating slight agreement.
From Table 4 we can see that overall the sys-
tem achieves 66% of the human performance
with comparable stability as human. In partic-
ular, Method 4 based on translation and translit-
eration generates much more perceivable morphs
than human because the system may search in a
larger vocabulary. Interestingly, similar encour-
aging results - system outperforms human - have
been observed by previous back-transliteration
work (Knight and Graehl, 1998).
It?s also interesting to see that human assessors
can only comprehend 76% of the human generated
morphs because of the following reasons: (1) the
morph is newly generated or it does not describe
the characteristics of the target entity well; and (2)
the target entity itself is not well known to human
assessors who do not keep close track of news top-
ics. In fact only 64 human generated morphs and
72 system generated morphs are perceivable by all
human assessors.
For Method 2, the human created morphs are
assessed as much more and funny than the sys-
tem generated ones because human creators use
this approach only if: (1). the radicals still reflect
the meaning of the character (e.g., ?? (worry)?
is decomposed into two radicals ??? (heart au-
tumn)? instead of three ????? (grain fire heart)
because people tend to feel sad when the leaves
fall in the autumn), (2). the morph reflects some
characteristics of the entity (e.g., ???? (Jiang
Zemin)? has a morph ????? (Water Engi-
neer Zemin)? because he gave many instructions
on water conservancy construction); or (3). The
morph becomes very vivid and funny (e.g., the
morph ?????? (Muji Yue Yue Bird)? for
???? is assessed as very funny because ??
?(Muji)? looks like a Japanese name, ???(Yue
Yue)? can also refer to a famous chubby woman,
and ??? (bird man)? is a bad word referring to
bad people); or (4). The morph expresses strong
sentiment or sarcasm; or (5) The morph is the
name of another entity (e.g., the morph ???(Gu
Yue)? for ????(Hu Jintao)? is also the name
of a famous actor who often acts as Mao Zedong).
The automatic approach didn?t explore these intel-
ligent constraints and thus produced more boring
morph. Moreover, sometimes human creators fur-
ther exploit traditional Chinese characters, gener-
alize or modify the decomposition results.
Table 3 presents some good (with average score
above 80%) and bad (with average score below
20%) examples.

Table 3: System Generated Morph Examples
To understand whether users would adopt sys-
tem generated morphs for their social media com-
munication, we also ask the assessors to recite
the morphs that they remember after the survey.
Among all the morphs that they remember cor-
rectly, 20.4% are system generated morphs, which
is encouraging.
3.3 Automatic Evaluation
Another important goal of morph encoding is to
avoid censorship and freely communicate about

Table 4: Human Evaluation Satisfaction Rate (%)
certain entities. To evaluate how well the new
morphs can pass censorship, we simulate the cen-
sorship using an automatic morph decoder con-
sisted of a morph candidate identification system
based on Support Vector Machines incorporating
anomaly analysis and our morph resolution sys-
tem (Huang et al, 2013). We use each system gen-
erated morph to replace its corresponding human-
created morphs in Weibo tweets and obtain a new
?morphed? data set. The morph decoder is then
applied to it. We define discovery rate as the per-
centage of morphs identified by the decoder, and
the ranking accuracy Acc@k to evaluate the reso-
lution performance. We conduct this decoding ex-
periment on 247 system generated and 151 human
generated perceivable morphs with perceivability
scores > 70% from human evaluation.
Figure 1 shows that in general the decoder
achieves lower discovery rate on system gener-
ated morphs than human generated ones, because
the identification component in the decoder was
trained based on human morph related features.
This result is promising because it demonstrates
that the system generated morphs contain new and
unique characteristics which are unknown to the
decoder. In contrast, from Figure 2 we can see
that system generated morphs can be more easily
resolved into the right target entities than human
generated ones which are more implicit.

4 Related Work
Some recent work attempted to map between Chi-
nese formal words and informal words (Xia et al,
2005; Xia and Wong, 2006; Xia et al, 2006; Li
Figure 2: Resolution Acc@K Accuracy (%)
and Yarowsky, 2008; Wang et al, 2013; Wang and
Kan, 2013). We incorporated the pronunciation,
lexical and semantic similarity measurements pro-
posed in these approaches. Some of our basic se-
lection criteria are also similar to the constraints
used in previous work on generating humors (Val-
itutti et al, 2013; Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).
5 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper proposed a new problem of encoding
entity morphs and developed a wide variety of
novel automatic approaches. In the future we will
focus on improving the language-independent ap-
proaches based on historical figure mapping and
culture and reputation modeling. In addition, we
plan to extend our approaches to other types of in-
formation including sensitive events, satires and
metaphors so that we can generate fable stories.
We are also interested in tracking morphs over
time to study the evolution of Internet language.
