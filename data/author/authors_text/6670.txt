Abstract
The LUNA corpus is a multi-lingual, multi-
domain spoken dialogue corpus currently
under development that will be used to de-
velop a robust natural spoken language un-
derstanding toolkit for multilingual dialogue
services. The LUNA corpus will be an-
notated at multiple levels to include an-
notations of syntactic, semantic, and dis-
course information; specialized annotation
tools will be used for the annotation at each
of these levels. In order to synchronize these
multiple layers of annotation, the PAULA
standoff exchange format will be used. In
this paper, we present the corpus and its
PAULA-based architecture.1
1 Introduction
XML standoff markup (Thompson and McKelvie,
1997; Dybkj?r et al, 1998) is emerging as the clean-
est way to organize multi-level annotations of cor-
pora. In many of the current annotation efforts based
on standoff a single multi-purpose tool such as the
NITE XML Toolkit (Carletta et al, 2003) or Word-
Freak (Morton and LaCivita, 2003) is used to anno-

tate as well as maintain all annotation levels (cf. the
SAMMIE annotation effort (Kruijff-Korbayova? et al,
2006b)).
However, it is often the case that specialized tools
are developed to facilitate the annotation of particu-
lar levels: examples include tools for segmentation
and transcription of the speech signal like PRAAT
(Boersma and Weenink, 2005) and TRANSCRIBER
(Barras et al, 1998), the SALSA tools for FrameNet-
style annotation (Burchardt et al, 2006), and MMAX
(Mu?ller and Strube, 2003) for coreference annota-
tion. Even in these cases, however, it may still be
useful, or even necessary, to be able to visualize
more than one level at once, or to ?knit? together2
multiple levels to create a file that can be used to
train a model for a particular type of annotation.
The Linguistic Annotation Framework by (Ide et al,
2003) was proposed as a unifying markup format to
be used to synchronize heterogeneous markup for-
mats for such purposes.
In this paper, we discuss how the PAULA represen-
tation format, a standoff format inspired by the Lin-
guistic Annotation Framework, is being used to syn-
chronize multiple levels of annotation in the LUNA
corpus, a corpus of spoken dialogues in multiple lan-
guages and multiple domains that is being created to
support the development of robust spoken language
understanding models for multilingual dialogue ser-
vices. The corpus is richly annotated with linguistic
information that is considered relevant for research
on dialogue, including chunks, named entities, argu-
ment structure, coreference, and dialogue acts. We
chose to adopt specialized tools for each level: e.g.,
2In the sense of the knit tool of the LT-XML suite.

transcription using TRANSCRIBER, coreference us-
ing MMAX, attributes using SEMANTIZER, etc. To
synchronize the annotation and allow cross-layer op-
erations, the annotations are mapped to a common
representation format, PAULA.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we present the LUNA project and the LUNA
corpus with its main annotation levels. In Section 3,
we introduce the PAULA exchange format, focusing
on the representation of time alignment and dialogue
phenomena. Finally we show how PAULA is used in
the LUNA corpus and discuss alternative formats.
2 The LUNA project
The aim of the LUNA project is to advance the state
of the art in understanding conversational speech
in Spoken Dialogue Systems (Gupta et al, 2005),
(Bimbot et al, 2006).
Three aspects of Spoken Language Understand-
ing (SLU) are of particular concern in LUNA: gen-
eration of semantic concept tags, semantic compo-
sition into conceptual structures and context sensi-
tive validation using information provided by the di-
alogue manager. In order to train and evaluate SLU
models, we will create an annotated corpus of spo-
ken dialogues in multiple domains and multiple lan-
guages: French, Italian, and Polish.
2.1 The LUNA corpus
The LUNA corpus is currently being collected, with
a target to collect 8100 human-machine dialogues
and 1000 human-human dialogues in Polish, Italian
and French. The dialogues are collected in the fol-
lowing application domains: stock exchange, hotel
reservation and tourism inquiries, customer support
service/help-desk and public transportation.
2.2 Multilevel annotation
Semantic interpretation involves a number of sub-
tasks, ranging from identifying the meaning of indi-
vidual words to understanding which objects are be-
ing referred to up to recovering the relation between
different semantic objects in the utterance and dis-
course level to, finally, understanding the commu-
nicative force of an utterance.
In some annotation efforts?e.g., in the annotation
of the French MEDIA Corpus (Bonneau-Maynard
and Rosset, 2003)? information about the meaning
of semantic chunks, contextual information about
coreference, and information about dialogue acts are
all kept in a single file. This approach however suf-
fers from a number of problems, including the fact
that errors introduced during the annotation at one
level may make other levels of annotation unusable
as well, and that it is not possible for two anno-
tators to work on different types of annotation for
the same file at the same time. Most current an-
notation efforts, therefore, tend to adopt the ?multi-
level? approach pioneered during the development
of the MAPTASK corpus and then developed as part
of work on the EU-funded MATE project (McKelvie
et al, 2001), in which each aspect of interpreta-
tion is annotated in a separate level, independently
maintained. This approach is being followed, for
instance, in the ONTONOTES project (Hovy et al,
2006) and the SAMMIE project (Kruijff-Korbayova
et al, 2006a).
For the annotation of the LUNA corpus, we de-
cided to follow the multilevel approach as well. That
allows us to achieve more granularity in the anno-
tation of each of the levels and to investigate more
easily dependencies between features that belong to
different levels. Furthermore, we can use different
specialized off-the-shelf annotation tools, splitting
up the annotation task and thus facilitating consis-
tent annotation.
2.3 Annotation levels
The LUNA corpus will contain different types of in-
formation. The first levels are necessary to prepare
the corpus for subsequent semantic annotation, and
include segmentation of the corpus in dialogue turns,
transcription of the speech signal, and syntactic pre-
processing with POS-tagging and shallow parsing.
The next level consists of the annotation of do-
main information using attribute-value pairs. This
annotation will be performed on all dialogues in the
corpus.
The other levels of the annotation scheme are not
mandatory, but at least a part of the dialogues will
be annotated in order to investigate contextual as-
pects of the semantic interpretation. These levels in-
clude the predicate structure, the relations between
referring expressions, and the annotation of dialogue
acts.

2.3.1 Segmentation and transcription of the
speech signal
Before transcription and annotation can begin, it
is necessary to segment the speech signal into dia-
logue turns and annotate them with speaker identity
and mark where speaker overlap occurs. The goal
of this segmentation is to be able to perform a tran-
scription and annotation of the dialogue turns with
or without dialogue context. While dialogue context
is preferable for semantic annotation, it slows down
the annotation process.
The tool we will use for the segmentation and
transcription of the speech signal is the open source
tool TRANSCRIBER3 (Barras et al, 1998).
The next step is the transcription of the speech
signal, using conventions for the orthographic tran-
scription and for the annotation of non-linguistic
acoustic events.
2.3.2 Part Of Speech Tagging and Chunking
The transcribed material will be annotated with
POS-tags, morphosyntactic information like agree-
ment features, and segmented based on syntactic
constituency.
For the POS-tags and morphosyntactic features,
we will follow the recommendations made in EA-
GLES (EAGLES, 1996), which allows us to have a
unified representation format for the corpus, inde-
pendently of the tools used for each language.
2.3.3 Domain Attribute Annotation
At this level, semantic segments will be anno-
tated following an approach used for the annotation
for the French MEDIA dialogue corpus (Bonneau-
Maynard and Rosset, 2003).
We specify the domain knowledge in domain on-
tologies. These are used to build domain-specific
dictionaries. Each dictionary contains:
? Concepts corresponding to classes of the ontol-
ogy and attributes of the annotation.
? Values corresponding to the individuals of the
domain.
? Constraints on the admissible values for each
concept.
3http://trans.sourceforge.net
The concept dictionaries are used to annotate se-
mantic segments with attribute-value pairs. The se-
mantic segments are produced by concatenation of
the chunks produced by the shallow parser. A se-
mantic segment is a unit that corresponds unambigu-
ously to a concept of the dictionary.

2.3.4 Predicate structure
The annotation of predicate structure facilitates
the interpretation of the relation between entities and
events occurring in the dialogue.
There are different approaches to annotate predi-
cate structure. Some of them are based upon syntac-
tic structure, with PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer,
2003) being one of the most relevant, building the
annotation upon the syntactic representation of the
TreeBank corpus (Marcus et al, 1993). An alter-
native to syntax-driven approaches is the annotation
using semantic roles as in FrameNet (Baker et al,
1998).
For the annotation of predicate structure in the
LUNA corpus, we decided to use a FrameNet-like
approach, rather than a syntax-based approach:
1. Annotation of dialogue interaction has to deal
with disfluencies, non-complete sentences, un-
grammaticality, etc., which complicates the use
of deep syntactic representations.
2. If we start from a syntactic representation, we
have to follow a long way to achieve the seman-
tic interpretation. Syntactic constituents must
be mapped to ?-roles, and then to semantic
roles. FrameNet offers the possibility of anno-
tating using directly semantic criteria.

formation. How can I help you?

For each domain, we define a set of frames. These
frames are defined based on the domain ontology,
with the named entities providing the frame ele-
ments. For all the frames we introduce the negation
as a default frame element.
For the annotation, first of all we annotate the en-
tities with a frame and a frame element.
Then if the target is overtly realized we make a
pointer from the frame elements to the target. The
next step is putting the frame elements and the target
(if overtly realized) in a set.

2.3.5 Coreference / Anaphoric relations
To annotate anaphoric relations we will use an an-
notation scheme close to the one used in the ARRAU
project (Artstein and Poesio, 2006). This scheme
has been extensively tested with dialogue corpora
and includes instructions for annotating a variety of
anaphoric relations, including bridging relations. A
further reason is the robustness of the scheme that
doesn?t require one single interpretation in the an-
notation.
The first step is the annotation of the information
status of the markables with the tags given and
new. If the markables are annotated with given,
the annotator will select the most recent occurrence
of the object and add a pointer to it. If the mark-
able is annotated with new, we distinguish between
markables that are related to a previously mentioned
object (associative reference) or don?t have such a
relation.
If there are alternative interpretations, which of a
list of candidates can be the antecedent, the annota-
tor can annotate the markable as ambiguous and
add a pointer to each of the possible antecedents.

2.3.6 Dialogue acts
In order to associate the intentions of the speaker
with the propositional content of the utterances, the
segmentation of the dialogue turns in utterances is
based on the annotation of predicate structure. Each
set of frame elements will correspond to an utter-
ance.
Each utterance will be annotated using a multi-
dimensional annotation scheme partially based on
the DAMSL scheme (Allen and Core, 1997) and on
the proposals of ICSI-MRDA (Dhillon et al, 2004).
We have selected nine dialogue acts from the
DAMSL scheme as initial tagset, that can be extended
for the different application domains. Each utter-
ance will be annotated with as many tags as applica-
ble.

3 PAULA - a Linguistic Standoff Exchange
Format
PAULA stands for Potsdamer Austauschformat fu?r
linguistische Annotation (?Potsdam Interchange
Format for Linguistic Annotation?) and has been de-
veloped for the representation of data annotated at
multiple layers. The application scenario is sketched
in Fig 1: researchers use multiple, specialized off-
the-shelf annotation tools, such as EXMARALDA or
MMAX, to enrich data with linguistic information.
The tools store the data in tool-specific formats and,
hence, it is not straightforward to combine informa-
tion from different sources and, e.g., to search for
correlations across multiple annotation layers.
This is where PAULA comes in: PAULA maps
the tool-specific formats to a common format and
serves as an interchange format between these
tools.6 Moreover, the annotations from the different
sources are merged into one single representation.
PAULA makes this data available for further appli-
cations, such as searching the data by means of the
tool ANNIS7, or to feed statistical applications like
WEKA8.
PAULA is an XML-based standoff format for lin-
guistic annotations, inspired by the ?dump format?
6Currently, we provide PAULA import filters for the follow-
ing tools and formats: Exmaralda, MMAX, RST Tool/URML,
annotate/TIGER XML. Export from PAULA to the tool formats
is at present supported for the original source format only. We
plan to support the export of selected annotations to other tools.
This is, however, not a trivial task since it may involve loss of
information.

Figure 1: PAULA annotation scenario
of the Linguistic Annotation Framework (Ide et al,
2003).9 With PAULA, not only is the primary data
separated from its annotations, but individual anno-
tation layers (such as parts of speech and dialogue
acts) are separated from each other as well. The
standoff approach allows us to mark overlapping
segments in a straightforward way: by distributing
annotations over different files (XML as such does
not easily account for overlapping segments, since
its object model is a hierarchical, tree-like structure).
Moreover, new annotation layers can be added eas-
ily.
PAULA assumes that a representation of the pri-
mary data is stored in a file that optionally spec-
ifies a header with meta information, followed by
a tag <body>, which contains a representation of
the primary data. In Fig. 2, the first box displays
the transcription, with all contributions from the first
speaker coming first, and the contributions from the
other speaker(s) following (put in italics in the Fig-
ure).
The basic type of ?annotation? are markables, en-
coded by the XML element <mark>. Markables
specify ?anchors?, i.e., locations or ranges that can
be annotated by linguistic information. The loca-
tions and ranges are positions or spans in the source
text or timeline, which are referenced by means of
XLinks and XPointer expressions. For instance, the
?Token? markables in Fig. 2 define spans that cor-
9The term ?standoff? describes the situation where primary
data (e.g., the transcription) and annotations of this data are
stored in separate files (Thompson and McKelvie, 1997).
