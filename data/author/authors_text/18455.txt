Abstract
Human engagement in narrative is partially
driven by reasoning about discourse relations
between narrative events, and the expectations
about what is likely to happen next that results
from such reasoning. Researchers in NLP
have tackled modeling such expectations from
a range of perspectives, including treating it as
the inference of the CONTINGENT discourse
relation, or as a type of common-sense causal
reasoning. Our approach is to model likeli-
hood between events by drawing on several of
these lines of previous work. We implement
and evaluate different unsupervised methods
for learning event pairs that are likely to be
CONTINGENT on one another. We refine event
pairs that we learn from a corpus of film scene
descriptions utilizing web search counts, and
evaluate our results by collecting human judg-
ments of contingency. Our results indicate that
the use of web search counts increases the av-
erage accuracy of our best method to 85.64%
over a baseline of 50%, as compared to an av-
erage accuracy of 75.15% without web search.
1 Introduction
Human engagement in narrative is partially driven
by reasoning about discourse relations between nar-
rative events, and the expectations about what is
likely to happen next that results from such reason-
ing (Gerrig, 1993; Graesser et al, 1994; Lehnert,
1981; Goyal et al, 2010). Thus discourse relations
are one of the primary means to structure narrative
in genres as diverse as weblogs, search queries, sto-
ries, film scripts and news articles (Chambers and
Jurafsky, 2009; Manshadi et al, 2008; Gordon and
Swanson, 2009; Gordon et al, 2011; Beamer and
Girju, 2009; Riaz and Girju, 2010; Do et al, 2011).
DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are
asleep in bed.
Gradually the room lights brighten. the clock chimes
and begins speaking in a soft, feminine voice.
They don?t budge. Shortly, the clock chimes again.
Quail?s wife stirs. Maddeningly, the clock chimes a
third time.
CLOCK (continuing)Tick, tock ?.
Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off. Then he sits
up in bed.
He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits
on the edge of the bed. He puts on his glasses and sits,
lost in thought.
He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early
thirties. He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is
attractive and rather off-hand towards him.
Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing
for her slippers.
Figure 1: Opening Scene from Total Recall
Recent work in NLP has tackled the inference of
relations between events from a broad range of per-
spectives: (1) as inference of a discourse relations
(e.g. the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) CON-
TINGENT relation and its specializations); (2) as a
type of common sense reasoning; (3) as part of text
understanding to support question-answering; and
(4) as way of learning script-like or plot-like knowl-
edge structures. All these lines of work aim to model
narrative understanding, i.e. to enable systems to in-
fer which events are likely to have happened even
though they have not been mentioned in the text
(Schank et al, 1977), and which events are likely
to happen in the future. Such knowledge has prac-
tical applications in commonsense reasoning, infor-
369
mation retrieval, question answering, narrative un-
derstanding and inferring discourse relations.
We model this likelihood between events by
drawing on the PTDB?s general definition of the
CONTINGENT relation, which encapsulates relations
elsewhere called CAUSE, CONDITION and ENABLE-
MENT (Prasad et al, 2008a; Lin et al, 2010; Pitler et
al., 2009; Louis et al, 2010). Our aim in this paper
is to implement and evaluate a range of different un-
supervised methods for learning event pairs that are
likely to be CONTINGENT on one another.
We first utilize a corpus of scene descriptions
from films because they are guaranteed to have an
explicit narrative structure. Moreover, screenplay
scene descriptions tend to be told in temporal or-
der (Beamer and Girju, 2009; Gordon and Swan-
son, 2009), which makes them a good resource for
learning about contingencies between events. In
addition, scenes in film represent many typical se-
quences from real life, while providing a rich source
of event clusters related to battles, love and mys-
tery. We carry out separate experiments for the ac-
tion movie genre and the romance movie genre. For
example, in the scene from Total Recall, from the
action movie genre (See Fig. 1), we might learn that
the event of sits up is CONTINGENT on the event
of clock chimes. The subset of the corpus we
use comprises 123,869 total unique event pairs.
We produce initial scalar estimates of poten-
tial CONTINGENCY between events using four
previously defined measures of distributional co-
occurrence. We then refine these estimates through
web searches that explicitly model the patterns of
narrative event sequences that were previously ob-
served to be likely within a particular genre. There
are several advantages of this method: (1) events in
the same genre tend to be more similar than events
across genres, so less data is needed to estimate
co-occurrence; (2) film scenes are typically nar-
rated via simple tenses in the correct temporal order,
which allows the ordering of events to contribute to
the estimation of the CONTINGENCY relation; (3)
The web counts focus on validating event pairs al-
ready deemed to be likely to be CONTINGENT in
the smaller, more controlled, film scene corpus. To
test our method, we conduct perceptual experiments
with human subjects on Mechanical Turk by asking
them to select which of two pairs of events are the
most likely. For example, given the scene from To-
tal Recall in Fig. 1, Mechanical Turkers are asked
to select whether the sequential event pair clock
chimes, sits up is more likely than clock
chimes followed by a randomly selected event
from the action film genre. Our experimental data
and annotations are available at http://nlds.
soe.ucsc.edu/data/EventPairs.
Sec. 2 describes our experimental method in de-
tail. Sec. 3 describes how we set up our evaluation
experiments and the results. We show that none of
the methods from previous work perform better on
our data than 75.15% average accuracy as measured
by human perceptions of CONTINGENCY. But after
web search refinement, we achieve an average accu-
racy of 85.64%. We delay a more detailed compari-
son to previous work to Sec. 4 where we summarize
our results and compare previous work to our own.
2 Experimental Method
Our method uses a combination of estimating
the likelihood of a CONTINGENT relation between
events in a corpus of film scenes (Walker et al,
2012b), with estimates then revised through web
search. Our experiments are based on two sub-
sets of 862 film screen plays collected from the
IMSDb website using its ontology of film genres
(Walker et al, 2012b): a set of action movies of 115
screenplays totalling 748 MB, and a set of romance
movies of 71 screenplays totalling 390 MB. Fig. 1
provided an example scene from the action movie
genre from the IMSDb corpus.
We assume that the relation we are aiming to learn
is the PDTB CONTINGENT relation, which is de-
fined as a relation that exists when one of the sit-
uations described in the text spans that are identi-
fied as the two arguments of the relation, i.e. Arg1
and Arg2, causally influences the other (Prasad et
al., 2008b). As Girju notes, it is notoriously dif-
ficult to define causality without making the defi-
nition circular, but we follow Beamer and Girju?s
work in assuming that if events A, B are causally
related then B should occur less frequently when it
is not preceded by A and that B?A should be much
less frequent than A? B. We assume that both the
CAUSE and CONDITION subtypes of the CONTIN-
GENCY relation will result in pairs of events that are
likely to occur together and in a particular order. In
particular we assume that the subtypes of the PDTB
taxonomy of Contingency.Cause.Reason and Con-
tingency.Cause.Result are the most likely to occur
together as noted in previous work. Other related
370
work has made use of discourse connectives or dis-
course taggers (implicit discourse relations) to pro-
vide additional evidence of CONTINGENCY (Do et
al., 2011; Gordon et al, 2011; Chiarcos, 2012; Pitler
et al, 2009; Lin et al, 2010), but we do not because
the results have been mixed. In particular these dis-
course taggers are trained on The Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) and are unlikely to work well on our data.
We define an event as a verb lemma with its sub-
ject and object. Two events are considered equal if
they have the same verb. We do not believe word
ambiguities to be a primary concern, and previous
work also defines events to be the same if they have
the same surface verb, in some cases with a restric-
tion that the dependency relations should also be
the same (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers
and Jurafsky, 2009; Do et al, 2011; Riaz and Girju,
2010; Manshadi et al, 2008). Word sense ambigu-
ities are also reduced in specific genres (Action and
Romance) of film scenes.
Our method for estimating the likelihood of a
CONTINGENT relations between events consists of
four steps:
1. TEXT PROCESSING: We use Stanford
CoreNLP to annotate the corpus docu-
ment by document and store the annotated text
in XML format (Sec. 2.1);
2. COMPUTE EVENT REPRESENTATIONS: We
form intermediate artifacts such as events, pro-
tagonists and event pairs from the annotated
documents. Each event has its arguments (sub-
ject and object). We calculate the frequency of
the event across the relevant genre (Sec. 2.2);
3. CALCULATE CONTINGENCY MEASURES: We
define 4 different measures of contingency and
calculate each one separately using the results
from Steps 1 and 2 above. We call each re-
sult a PREDICTED CONTINGENT EVENT PAIR
(PCEP). All measures return scalar values that
we use to rank the PCEPs (Sec. 2.3);
4. WEB SEARCH REFINEMENT: We select the top
100 event pairs calculated by each contingency
measure, and construct a RANDOM EVENT
PAIR (REP) for each PCEP that preserves the
first element of the PCEP, and replaces the sec-
ond element with another event selected ran-
domly from within the same genre. We then
define web search patterns for both PCEP and
REPs and compare the counts (Sec. 2.4).
2.1 Text Processing
We first separate our screen plays into two sets of
documents, one for the action genre and one for the
romance genre. Because we are interested in the
event descriptions that are part of the scene descrip-
tions, we excise the dialog from each screen play.
Then using the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline, we an-
notate the film scene files. Annotations include tok-
enization, lemmatization, named entity recognition,
parsing and coreference resolution.
We extract the events by keeping all tokens whose
POS tags begin with VB. We then use the depen-
dency parse to find the subject and object of each
verb (if any), considering only nsubj, agent,
dobj, iobj, nsubjpass. We keep the orig-
inal tokens of the subject and the object for further
processing.
2.2 Compute Event Representations
Given the results of Step 1 we start by generalizing
the subject and object stored with each event by sub-
stituting tokens with named entities if there are any
named entities tagged. Otherwise we generalize the
subjects and the objects using their lemmas. For ex-
ample, person UNLOCK door, as illustrated in
Table 1.
We then integrate all the subjects and objects
across all film scene files, keeping a record of the
frequency of each subject and object. For example,
[person (115), organization (14),
door (3)] UNLOCK [door (127),
person (5), bars (2)]. The most frequent
subject and object are selected as representative ar-
guments for the event. We then count the frequency
of each event across all the film scene files.
Within each film scene file, we count adjacent
events as potential CONTINGENT event pairs. Two
event pairs are defined as equal if they have the same
verbs in the same order. We also count the frequency
of each event pair.
2.3 Calculate Contingency Measures
We calculate four different measures of CONTIN-
GENCY based on previous work using the results
of Steps 1 and 2 (Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2). These
measures are pointwise mutual information, causal
potential, bigram probability and protagonist-based
371
causal potential as described in detail below. We
calculate each measure separately by genre for the
action and romance genres of the film corpus.
Pointwise Mutual Information. The majority of
related work uses pointwise mutual information
(PMI) in some form or another (Chambers and Ju-
rafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Riaz
and Girju, 2010; Do et al, 2011). Given a set of
events (a verb and its collected set of subjects and
objects), we calculate the PMI using the standard
definition:
pmi(e1, e2) = log
P (e1, e2)
P (e1)P (e2)
(1)
in which e1 and e2 are two events. P (e1) is the
probability that event e1 occur in the corpus:
P (e1) =
count(e1)
?
x count(ex)
(2)
where count(e1) is the count of how many times
event e1 occurs in the corpus, and
?
x count(ex) is
the count of all the events in the corpus. The nu-
merator is the probability that the two events occur
together in the corpus:
P (e1, e2) =
count(e1, e2)
?
x
?
y count(ex, ey)
(3)
in which count(e1, e2) is the number of times the
two events e1 and e2 occur together in the corpus
regardless of their order. Only adjacent events in
each document are paired up. PMI is a symmetric
measurement for the relationship between two
events. The order of the events does not matter.
Causal Potential. Beamer and Girju proposed a
measure called Causal Potential (CP) based on pre-
vious work in philosophy and logic, along with an
annotation test for causality. An annotator decid-
ing whether event A causes event B asks herself the
following questions, where answering yes to both
means the two events are causally related:
? Does event A occur before (or simultaneously)
with event B?
? Keeping constant as many other states of affairs
of the world in the given text context as possi-
ble, does modifying event A entail predictably
modifying event B?
As Beamer & Girju note, this annotation test is
objective, and it is simple to execute mentally. It
only assumes that the average person knows a lot
about how things work in the world and can reliably
answer these questions. CP is then defined below,
where the arrow notation means ordered bigrams,
i.e. event e1 occurs before event e2:
?(e1, e2) = pmi(e1, e2) + log
P (e1 ? e2)
P (e2 ? e1)
(4)
where pmi(e1, e2) = log
P (e1, e2)
P (e1)P (e2)
The causal potential consists of two terms: the
first is pair-wise mutual information (PMI) and
the second is relative ordering of bigrams. PMI
measures how often events occur as a pair; whereas
relative ordering counts how often event order
occurs in the bigram. If there is no ordering of
events, the relative ordering is zero. We smooth
unseen event pairs by setting their frequency equal
to 1 to avoid zero probabilities. For CP as with PMI,
we restrict these calculations to adjacent events.
Column CP of Table 1 below provides sample
values for the CP measure.
Probabilistic Language Models. Our third method
models event sequences using statistical language
models (Manshadi et al, 2008). A language model
estimates the probability of a sequence of words us-
ing a sample corpus. To identify contingent event
sequences, we apply a bigram model which esti-
mates the probability of observing the sequence of
two words w1 and w2 as follows:
P (w1, w2) ?= P (w2|w1) =
count(w1, w2)
count(w1)
(5)
Here, the words are events. Each verb is a single
event and each film scene is treated as a sequence of
verbs. For example, consider the following sentence
from Total Recall:
Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table,
eating breakfast.
This sentence is represented as the sequence of its
two verbs: sit, eat. We estimate the probability
of verb bigrams using Equation 5 and hypothesize
that the verb sequences with higher probability are

more likely to be contingent. We apply a threshold
of 20 for count(w1, w2) to avoid infrequent and
uncommon bigrams.
Protagonist-based Models. We also used a method
of generating event pairs based not only on the con-
secutive events in text but on their protagonist. This
is based on the assumption that the agent, or protag-
onist, will tend to perform actions that further her
own goals, and are thus causally related. We called
this method protagonist-based because all events
were partitioned into multiple sets where each set of
events has one protagonist. This method is roughly
based on previous work using chains of discourse
entities to induce narrative schemas (Chambers and
Jurafsky, 2009).
Events that share one protagonist were extracted
from text according to co-referring mentions pro-
vided by the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit.1 A man-
ual examination of coreference results on a sample
of movie scripts suggests that the accuracy is only
around 60%: most of the time the same entity (in its
1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml
nominal and pronominal forms) was not recognized
and was assigned as a new entity.
We preserve the order of events based on their tex-
tual order assuming as above that film scripts tend
to preserve temporal order. An ordered event pair
is generated if both events share a protagonist. We
further filter event pairs by eliminating those whose
frequency is less than 5 to filter insignificant and rare
event pairs. This also tends to catch errors generated
by the Stanford parser.
CP was then calculated accordingly to Equa-
tion 4. To calculate the PMI part of CP, we combine
the frequencies of event pairs in both orders.
2.4 Web Search Refinement
The final step of our method is WEB SEARCH RE-
FINEMENT. Our hypothesis is that using the film
corpus within a particular genre to do the initial esti-
mates of contingency takes advantage of genre prop-
erties such as similar events and narration of scenes
in chronological order. However the film corpus is
necessarily small, and we can augment the evidence
for a particular contingent relation by defining spe-
cific narrative sequence patterns and collecting web
373
counts.
Recall that PCEP stands for predicted contin-
gent event pair and that REP stands for random
event pair. We first select the top 100 event pairs
calculated by each CONTINGENCY measure, and
construct a RANDOM EVENT PAIR (REP) for each
PCEP that preserves the first element of the PCEP,
and replaces the second element with another event
selected randomly from within the same genre. We
then define web search patterns for both PCEP and
REPs and compare the counts. PCEPs should be fre-
quent in web search and REPs should be infrequent.
Our web refinement procedure is:
? For each event pair, PCEPs and REPs, create a
Google search pattern as illustrated by Table 1,
and described in more detail below.
? Search for the exact match in Google gen-
eral web search using incognito browsing and
record the estimated count of results returned;
? Remove all the PCEP/REP pairs with PCEP
Google search count less than 100: highly con-
tingent events should be frequent in a general
web search;
? Remove all PCEP/REP pairs with REP Google
search count greater than 100: events that are
not contingent on one another should not be
frequent in a general web search.
The motivation for this step is to provide addi-
tional evidence for or against the contingency of a
pair of events. Table 1 shows a selection of the top
100 PCEPs learned using the Causal potential (CP)
Metric, the web search patterns that are automati-
cally derived from the PCEPs (Column 4), the REPs
that were constructed for each PCEP (Column 6),
the web search patterns that were automatically de-
rived from the REPs (Column 7). Column 5 shows
the results of web search hits for the PCEP patterns
and Column 8 shows the results of web search hits
for the REP patterns. These hit counts were then
used in refining our estimates of CONTINGENCY for
the learned patterns as described above.
Note that the web search patterns do not aim to
find every possible match of the targeted CONTIN-
GENT relation that could possibly occur. Instead,
they are generalizations of the instances of PCEPs
that we found in the films corpus that are targeted at
finding hits that are the most likely to occur in nar-
rative sequences. Narrative sequences are most re-
liably signalled by use of the historical present tense,
e.g. as instantiated in the search patterns He knows
in Row 1 and He comes in Row 2 of Table 1 (Swan-
son and Gordon, 2012; Beamer and Girju, 2009;
Labov and Waletzky, 1997). In addition, we use
the ?*? operator in Google Search to limit search
to pairs of events reported in the historical present
tense, that are ?near? one another, and in a particular
sequence. We don?t care whether the events are in
the same utterance or in sequential utterances, thus
for the second verb (event) we do not include a sub-
ject pronoun he. These search patterns are not in-
tended to match the original instances in the film
corpus and in general they are unlikely to match
those instances.
For example, consider the search patterns and
results shown in Row 1 of Table 1. The
PCEP is (person KNOW person, person
MEAN what). The REP is (person KNOW
person, person PEDDLE papers). Our
prediction is that the REP should be much less likely
in web search counts and the results validate that
predication. A paired t-test over the 100 top PCEP
pairs for the CP measure comparing the hit counts
for the PCEP pairs vs. the REP pairs was highly
significant (p < .00001). However, consider Row
7. Even though in general the PCEP pairs are more
likely (as measured by the paired t-test compar-
ing web search counts for PCEPs vs REPs), there
are cases where the REP is highly likely as shown
by the REP (person take person, person
CATCH person) in Row 7. Alternatively there are
cases where the web search counts provide evidence
against one of the PCEPs. Consider Rows 3, 4, 10
and 12. In all of these cases the web counts NumHits
for the PCEP number in the tens.
After the web search refinement, we retain the
PCEP/REP pairs with initially high PCEP estimates,
for which we found good evidence for contingency
and for randomness, e.g. Row 1 and 2 in Table 1.
We use 100 as a threshold because most of the time
the estimate result count from Google is either a
very large number (millions) or a very small num-
ber (tens), as illustrated by the NumHits columns in
Table 1.
We experimented with different types of patterns
with a development set of PCEPs before we settled
on the search pattern template shown in Table 1. We
374
decided to use third person rather than first person
patterns, because first person patterns are only one
type of narrative (Swanson and Gordon, 2012). We
also decided to utilize event patterns without typical
objects, such as head in person REST head in
Row 2 of Table 1. We do not have any evidence that
this is the optimal search pattern template because
we did not systematically try other types of search
patterns.
3 Evaluation and Results
While other work uses a range of methods for evalu-
ating accuracy, to our knowledge our work is the first
to use human judgments from Mechanical Turk to
evaluate the accuracy of the learned PCEPs. We first
describe the evaluation setup in Sec. 3.1 and then re-
port the results in Sec. 3.2
3.1 Mechanical Turk Contingent Pair
Evaluations
We used three different types of HITs (Human Intel-
ligence Tasks) on Mechanical Turk for our evalua-
tion. Two of the HITS are in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The
differences in the different types of HITS involve:
(1) whether the arguments of events were given in
the HIT, as in Fig. 2 and (2): whether the Turkers
were told that the order of the events mattered, as
in Fig. 3. We initially thought that providing the
arguments to the events as shown in Fig. 2 would
help Turkers to reason about which event was more
likely. We tested this hypothesis only in the action
genre for the Causal Potential Measure. For CP, Bi-
gram and Protag the order of events always matters.
For the PMI task, the order of the events doesn?t
matter because PMI is a symmetric measure. Fig. 2
illustrates the instructions that were given with the
HIT when the event order doesn?t matter. In all the
other cases, the instructions that were given with the
HIT are those in Fig. 3 where the Turkers are in-
structed to pay attention to the order of the events.
For all types of HITS, for all measures of CON-
TINGENCY, we set up the task as a choice over
two alternatives, where for each predicted contin-
gent pair (PCEP), we generate a random event pair
(REP), with the first event the same and the second
one randomly chosen from all the events in the same
film genre. The REPs are constructed the same way
as we construct REPs for web search refinement,
as illustrated by Table 1. This is illustrated in both
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. For all types of HITS, we ask 15
Turkers from a pre-qualified group to select which
pair (the PCEP or the REP) is more likely to oc-
cur together. Thus, the framing of these Mechani-
cal Turk tasks only assumes that the average person
knows how the world works; we do not ask them to
explicitly reason about causality as other work does
(Beamer and Girju, 2009; Gordon et al, 2011; Do et
al., 2011).
For each measure of CONTINGENCY, we take 100
event pairs with highest PCEP scores, and put them
in 5 HITs with twenty items per HIT. Previous work
has shown that for many common NLP tasks, 7
Turkers? average score can match expert annotations
(Snow et al, 2008). However, we use 15 Turkers
because we had no gold-standard data and because
we were not sure how difficult the task is. It is
clearly subjective. To calculate the accuracy of each
method, we computed the average correlation coef-
ficient between each pair of raters and eliminate the
5 lowest scoring workers. We then used the percep-
tions of the 10 remaining workers to calculate accu-
racy as # of correct answers / total # of answers.
In general, deciding when a MTurk worker is un-
reliable when the data is subjective is a difficult
problem. In the future we plan to test other solu-
tions to measuring annotator reliability as proposed
in related work (Callison-Burch, 2009; Snow et al,
2008; Karger et al, 2011; Dawid and Skene, 1979;
Welinder et al, 2010; Liu et al, 2012).
3.2 Results
We report our results in terms of overall accuracy.
Because the Mechanical Turk task is a choose-
one question rather than a binary classification,
Precision = Recall in our experimental results:
True Positive = Number of Correct Answers
True Negative = Number of Correct Answers
False Positive = Number of Incorrect Answers
False Positive = Number of Incorrect Answers
Precision =
True Positive
True Positive + False Positive
Recall =
True Positive
True Positive + False Negative
The accuracies of all the methods are shown in
Table 2. The results of using event arguments
(person KNOW person) in the Mechanical Turk
evaluation task (i.e. Fig. 2) is given in Rows 1 and
2 of Table 2. The accuracies for Rows 1 and 2 are

considerably lower than when the PCEPs are tested
without arguments. Comparing Rows 1 and 2 with
Rows 3 and 4 suggests that even if the arguments
provide extra information that help to ground the
type of event, in some cases these constraints on
events may mislead the Turkers or make the eval-
uation task more difficult. There is an over 10% in-
crease in CP + Web search accuracy for the task that
omits the event arguments (i.e. Fig. 3 as can be seen
by comparing Row 2 with Row 4. Thus omitting the
arguments of events in evaluations actually appears
to allow Turkers to make better judgments.
In addition, Table 2 shows clearly that for ev-
ery single method, accuracy is improved by refin-
ing the initial estimates of contingency using the
narrative-based web search patterns. Web search in-

where Turkers are told that the order of the events does matter.
creases the accuracy of almost all evaluation tasks,
with increases ranging from 3.45% to 12.5% when
averaged over both film genres (Column 5 Average
Acc%). The best performing method for the Ac-
tion genre is CP+Web Search at 87.67%, while the
best performing method for the Romance genre is
PMI+Web search at 88.52%. However PMI+Web
Search does not beat CP+Web Search on average
over both genres we tested, even though the Me-
chanical Turk HIT for CP specifies that the order of
the events matters: a more stringent criterion. Also
overall the CP+WebSearch method achieves a very
high 85.64% average accuracy.
It is also interesting to note the variation across
the different methods. For example, while it is
well known that PMI typically requires very large
corpora to make good estimates, the PMI method
without web search refinement has an initially high
accuracy of 79.60% for the romance genre, while
only achieving 68.70% for action. Perhaps this dif-
ference arises because the romance genre is more
highly causal, or because situations are more struc-
tured in romance, providing better estimates with a
small corpus. However even in this case of romance
with PMI, adding web search refinement provides
an almost 10% increase in absolute accuracy to the
highest accuracy of any combination, i.e. 88.52%.
There is also an interesting case of Protag CP for
the romance genre where web search refinement ac-
tually decreases accuracy by 4.1%. In future work
we plan to examine more genres from the film cor-
pus and also examine the role of corpus size in more
detail.
4 Discussion and Future Work
We induced event pairs using several methods from
previous work with similar aims but widely different
problem formulations and evaluation methods. We
used a verb-rich film scene corpus where events are
normally narrated in temporal order. We used Me-
chanical Turk to evaluate the learned pairs of CON-
TINGENT events using human perceptions. In the
first stage drawing on previous measures of distribu-
tional co-occurrence, we achieved an overall average
accuracy of around 70%, over a 50% baseline. We
then implemented a novel method of defining narra-
tive sequence patterns using the Google Search API,
and used web counts to further refine our estimates
of the contingency of the learned event pairs. This
increased the overall average accuracy to around
77%, which is 27% above the baseline. Our results
indicate that the use of web search counts increases
the average accuracy of our Causal Potential-based
method to 85.64% as compared to an average accu-
racy of 75.15% without web search. To our knowl-
edge this is the highest accuracy achieved in tasks of
377
this kind to date.
Previous work on recognition of the PDTB CON-
TINGENT relation has used both supervised and un-
supervised learning, and evaluation typically mea-
sures precision and recall against a PDTB annotated
corpus (Do et al, 2011; Pitler et al, 2009; Zhou et
al., 2010; Chiarcos, 2012; Louis et al, 2010). We
use an unsupervised approach and measure accuracy
using human perceptions. Other work by Girju and
her students defined a measure called causal poten-
tial and then used film screen plays to learn a knowl-
edge base of causal pairs of events. They evaluate
the pairs by asking two trained human annotators to
label whether occurrences of those pairs in their cor-
pus are causally related (Beamer and Girju, 2009;
Riaz and Girju, 2010). We also make use of their
causal potential measure. Work on commonsense
causal reasoning aims to learn causal relations be-
ween pairs of events using a range of methods ap-
plied to a large corpus of weblog narratives (Gordon
et al, 2011; Gordon and Swanson, 2009; Manshadi
et al, 2008). One form of evaluation aimed to pre-
dict the last event in a sequence (Manshadi et al,
2008), while more recent work uses the learned pairs
to improve performance on the COPA SEMEVAL
task (Gordon et al, 2011).
Related work on SCRIPT LEARNING induces
likely sequences of temporally ordered events in
news, rather than CONTINGENCY or CAUSALITY
(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Ju-
rafsky, 2009). Chambers & Jurafsky also evaluate
against a corpus of existing documents, by leaving
one event out of a document (news story), and then
testing the system?s ability to predict the missing
event. To our knowledge, our method is the first
to augment distributional semantics measures from
a corpus with web search data. We are also the first
to evaluate the learned event pairs with a human per-
ceptual evaluation with native speakers.
We hypothesize that there are several advantages
to our method: (1) events in the same genre tend to
be more similar than events across genres, so less
data is needed to estimate co-occurrence; (2) film
scenes are typically narrated via simple tenses in the
correct temporal order, which allows the ordering
of events to contribute to estimates of the CONTIN-
GENCY relation; (3) The web counts focus on vali-
dating event pairs already deemed to be likely to be
CONTINGENT in the smaller, more controlled, film
scence corpus.
Our work capitalizes on event sequences narrated
in temporal order as a cue to causality. We expect
this approach to generalize to other domains where
these properties hold, such as fables, personal stories
and news articles. We do not expect this technique
to generalize without further refinements to genres
frequently told out of temporal order or when events
are not mentioned consecutively in the text, for ex-
ample in certain types of fiction.
In future work we want to explore in more de-
tail the differences in performance of the different
contingency measures. For example, previous work
would suggest that the the higher the measure is, the
more likely the two events are to be contingent on
one another. To date, while we have only tested the
top 100, we have not found that the bottom set of
20 are less accurate than the top set of 20. This
could be due to corpus size, or the measures them-
selves, or noise from parser accuracy etc. As shown
in Table 2, web search refinement is able to eliminate
most noise in event pairs, but we would still aim to
achieve a better understanding of the circumstances
which lead particular methods to work better.
In future work we also want to explore ways of in-
ducing larger event structures than event pairs, such
as the causal chains, scripts, or narrative schemas of
previous work.

Abstract
This paper describes work on automatically
identifying categories of narrative clauses
in personal stories written by ordinary peo-
ple about their daily lives and experiences.
We base our approach on Labov & Walet-
zky?s theory of oral narrative which catego-
rizes narrative clauses into subtypes, such as
ORIENTATION, ACTION and EVALUATION.
We describe an experiment where we an-
notate 50 personal narratives from weblogs
and experiment with methods for achieving
higher annotation reliability. We use the re-
sulting annotated corpus to train a classi-
fier to automatically identify narrative cat-
egories, achieving a best average F-score of
.658, which rises to an F-score of .767 on
the cases with the highest annotator agree-
ment. We believe the identified narrative
structure will enable new types of compu-
tational analysis of narrative discourse.
1 Introduction
Sharing personal experiences by storytelling is
a fundamental aspect of human social behavior
(Fivush et al., 2005; Fivush and Nelson, 2004;
Habermas and Bluck, 2000; Bamberg, 2006;
Thorne, 2004; Bohanek et al., 2008; Thorne and
Nam, 2009; McLean and Thorne, 2003; Pratt and
Fiese, 2004). Humans appear to be wired to en-
gage with information that is narratively structured
(Gerrig, 1993; Bamberg, 2006; Bruner, 1991), and
telling stories provides a critical developmental and
societal function, by serving as a means to reinforce
community value systems and to define individual
identity (Thorne and Shapiro, 2011; Thorne et al.,
2007). This has led some theorists to claim that ?the
stories they tell? is the defining aspect of both indi-
viduals and cultures.
Unlike any prior time in human history, personal
narratives about many life experiences are being
told online, and are widely available in social me-
dia sources such as weblogs. A personal narrative
about an arrest is shown in Fig. 1, and one about a
protest is in Fig. 4. Narratives such as these provide
a valuable resource for learning a wealth of com-
monsense knowledge about people, the types of ac-
tivities they engage in, and the attitudes they hold.
They are also well suited to learning about causal
and temporal relationships between events because
narrative interpretation explicitly depends on the co-
herence of these relationships (Graesser et al., 1994;
Elson, 2012; Gordon et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2013).
This paper applies and tests a narrative clause la-
beling scheme to personal narratives. Our scheme
is derived from Labov & Waletzky?s (henceforth
L&W) theory of oral narrative (Labov, 1997; Labov
and Waletzky, 1967). L&W?s theory distinguishes
(1) clauses that indicate causal relationships (AC-
TION), from (2) clauses that provide traits or prop-
erties of the setting or characters (ORIENTATION),
from (3) clauses describing the story characters?
emotional reactions to the events (EVALUATION).
We adopt L&W?s theory for three reasons. First,
we believe that the narrative structure of personal
narratives posted on weblogs will be more similar
to oral narrative than they are to classical stories.
Second, we believe that any narrative discourse ty-
pology must at least distinguish ACTION, from ORI-
ENTATION, and EVALUATION. Third, personal sto-
ries found on the web are often noisy and diffi-
cult to interpret; they do not always clearly follow
well defined narrative conventions. A deep analysis

Figure 1: An excerpt from an example story from our corpus annotated with the L&W categories.
and annotation scheme, such as the one employed
by DramaBank (Elson and McKeown, 2010; Elson,
2012) that extends theories of narrative structure and
plot units (Stein et al., 2000; Lehnert, 1981), offers
many advantages. However, acquiring this level of
analysis on user generated content, such as blog sto-
ries, is resource intensive.
Research on computational models of narrative
structure typically focus on inferring the causal and
temporal relationships between events (Goyal et al.,
2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Riaz and Girju,
2010; Beamer and Girju, 2009; Do et al., 2011;
Manshadi et al., 2008; Gordon et al., 2011; Hu et al.,
2013). Yet L&W point out that stories are not just
about the events that occur. In fact, L&W say that
stories that are only about events are boring. Current
methods for inferring narrative structure, including
our own (Hu et al., 2013), do not distinguish event
clauses from other narrative clause types. But note
that actions only constitute about one third of the
clauses in the narratives in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4.
Sec. 2 provides more detail about L&W?s the-
ory. Sec. 3 describes the annotation experiments
and efforts to improve annotation reliability. Sec. 4
presents experiments on learning to automatically
classify L&W categories, where we examine the the
most predictive features, and the effect of annotator
agreement on classification accuracy. We achieve a
best average F-score of .658, which rises to an F-
score of .767 on the cases with the highest annotator
agreement. We analyze the types of errors the clas-
sifier makes in Sec. 5.1 and conclude in Sec. 6.
2 Labov & Waletzky?s Theory of
Narrative Discourse
L&W?s theory of oral narrative defines a story as
a series of ACTION clauses (events), of which at
least two must be temporally joined (e.g., clauses
7-13 in Fig. 1 and clauses 7-11 in Fig. 4) (Labov
and Waletzky, 1967; Labov, 1997) Stories also con-
tain ORIENTATIONS (setting the scene, describing
the characters), e.g. utterances 1-6 in Fig. 1. An
orientation clause introduces the time and place of
the events of the story, and identifies the participants
of the story and their initial behavior. To properly
understand narrative structure, orientations need to
be identified as a separate type of utterance distinct
from events. L&W define two other structural types
called ABSTRACT and CODA. The ABSTRACT is an
initial narrative clause summarizing the entire se-
quence of events. A CODA is final clause which
returns the narrative to the time of speaking, indi-
cating the end of the narrative. The CODA often pro-
vides the ?moral? of the story.
The final element of a story according to L&W
is EVALUATION, which L&W identify as essen-
tial to every story. According to L&W, evaluation
gives the reason for telling the story, or the point of
the story: without EVALUATION there is no story,
merely a boring recitation of events. L&W state
that the EVALUATION clauses may also provide in-
formation on the consequences of the events as they
172
relate to the goals and desires of the participants,
and can be used to describe the events that did not
occur, may have occurred, or could occur in the fu-
ture in the story. Clauses 14-16 and 18 in Fig. 1
provide the narrator?s evaluation of the transpiring
events as well as introducing possible but unreal-
ized alternative timelines. In theories of narrative
identity (McAdams, 2003; Thorne, 2004), evalua-
tion performs two additional functions: (1) it ex-
presses the tellers opinion and in doing so reflects
the value system of that person and their commu-
nity; (2) it constructs and maintains relations be-
tween the teller and the listener. Clauses 20 and 22
illustrate these functions where the narrator directly
reveals his affective response to the prior events.
3 Dataset
Corpus of Personal Stories. Previous work (Gor-
don and Swanson, 2009) showed that about 5% of
all weblog entries are personal stories describing an
event in the author?s daily life. They developed an
automatic classifier for identifying personal narra-
tives from a random sample of 5,000 posts from
a corpus of 44 million entries available as part of
the ICWSM 2010 dataset challenge (Burton et al.,
2009). 229 of these posts were manually labeled as
personal stories. Our experiments are based on 50
of these 229 stories.
Annotation Process. L&W?s theory applies to sub-
sentence discourse units in a narrative. It is an
open question what level of phrasal granularity is
appropriate to apply to written narratives. Here, we
treat each independent clause as the basic unit of
discourse and manually segment each story in our
dataset using this definition. This results in a collec-
tion of 1,602 independent clauses. We then divided
the 50 stories into 4 groups and annotated them in
batches among 3 annotators in order to refine our
annotation guidelines and process. This dataset is
freely available at https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/lw.
Previous work has applied L&W?s theory to Ae-
sop?s fables and achieved high levels of interanno-
tator agreement and extremely high machine learn-
ing accuracies (Rahimtoroghi et al., 2013). How-
ever personal narratives clearly provide a more chal-
lenging context for annotation. There was a high
level of disagreement after the initial round of an-
notation. We found at least 6 primary sources of
disagreements:
? Clauses of more than one category are common
with rising action and evaluation, e.g. a clause
containing elements of orientation, action, and
evaluation: After leaving the apartment at 6:45
AM, flying 2 hours, taking a cab to Seattle, and
then driving seven hours up to Whistler including
a border crossing, it?s safe to say that I felt pretty
much like a dick with legs.
? Actions that are implied but not explicitly stated
in the text.
? Stative descriptions of the world as a result of an
action that are not intuitively orientation.
? Stative descriptions of the world that are localized
to a specific place in the narrative, which is prob-
lematic to L&W?s definition of orientation.
? Subjective clauses in scene setting are usually ori-
entation, but are lexically similar to evaluation.
? Disambiguating the functional purpose of clauses
that describe actions, but may be intended to set
the scene as opposed to the rising action.
? Disambiguating the functional purpose of subjec-
tive language in the description of an event or
state, e.g., The gigantic tree outside my window,
The radiant blue of the sky.
After several rounds of annotation we stabilized
on a labeling scheme that hierarchically extends
the original L&W categories, along with annotation
guidelines that annotators could use to disambiguate
recurring problematic cases. The final set of ex-
tended category labels along with two reduced hi-
erarchical mappings are shown in Table 1.
STATIVE-LOCAL CONTEXT is a category for dis-
tinguishing stative descriptions of the world, that are
not intuitively orientation. For example:
? I saw the sign I expected to turn south on Hwy
138. The traffic sign pointed to Sutherlin and
Roseburg,
The clause in italics is a stative that describes the
sign seen in the previous action. It is clearly not an
action or evaluation, but is not intuitively an orien-
tation, because it is so locally dependent.
STATIVE-IMPLIED ACTIONS are clauses, which
do not explicitly mention an action or event, but im-
ply one that is necessary to maintain the causal or
temporal coherence of the remaining story. For ex-
ample: After that, we decided to walk some more.
In the context of the story it is necessary to know
that they actually did walk some more in order to
interpret the other actions described in the narrative.
Implied actions are often passive constructions that
describe a state of the world that could only be true

if an action had taken place. For example: We were
at the convention center in about 10 minutes.
STATIVE-CONSEQUENCE is a category that de-
scribes the state of the world that has resulted as
a consequence of an action, but does not directly
evaluate the goals, intentions or desires of the par-
ticipants. For example, clause 23 in Fig. 1.
Using this extended label set we were able to
achieve an inter-annotator agreement between the
3 annotators of 0.582 using Fleiss? ? on assign-
ing categories to clauses. We also mapped the full
set of labels to a smaller subsets to see if the finer
grained distinctions helped improve reliability on
more coarse grained labeling schemes. The ex-
tended labels we included were generally different
types of stative descriptions of the world, which
were all mapped to a single category for the Stative
label set. Finally, we mapped each extended label
to an original L&W category that we thought best
fit the original definitions. When mapping back to
these reduced label sets we were able to increase the
? to 0.597 for the stative set and 0.630 for the orig-
inal L&W categories. This result indicates that we
can achieve higher reliability by ensuring that the
annotators think carefully about particular kinds of
distinctions between different stative clauses.
Gold standard labels were selected based on a sim-
ple majority of the annotator assignments. When no
annotators agreed on a label, one of the selected la-
bels was chosen at random. Once completed there
were 424 action clauses, 702 evaluations, 26 not sto-
ries, 306 orientation, 17 stative consequences, 12
implied actions and 115 local contexts. Note that
EVALUATION and ORIENTATION clauses that would
not be distinguished from ACTION by previous work
constitute two thirds of the clauses.
4 Experiments
The triply annotated dataset described above was
used as training and test data for experiments on
learning to automatically label narrative clauses. 40
narratives were randomly selected to be used as
training and development data and the remaining
10 narratives for test data. The average story in
the training data had 29.3 clauses with the shortest

story consisting of 4 and the maximum consisting
of 100. The average story in the test data had 43
clauses with the shortest story consisting of 4 and
the maximum consisting of 114.
To derive feature representations of each type of
narrative clause we started with the features pre-
sented in (Rahimtoroghi et al., 2013). We refined
these by examining L&W?s descriptions of distin-
guishing features of each category. Table 2 summa-
rizes the features we automatically extracted from
all narrative clauses in the weblogs.
First, we used the Stanford Parser to distinguish
independent and dependent clauses and kept track
separately of features that occurred in both types
of clause. This is because L&W state that the
unit of analysis should be an independent clause
with its subordinate clauses, but we felt that these
were exactly the cases that often caused difficul-
ties during annotation. However distinguishing
between the features occurring in the two clause
types would allow us to determine if and when
the features of the subordinate clause were rele-
vant or more informative for automatic classifica-
tion. Then, within both dependent and independent
clauses, we distinguished the part-of-speech of the
main verb (POS), whether the clause contained a
negation (Negate), lexical semantic categories from
LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001), dependency rela-
tions (DEP), lexical unigrams (STEM), and whether
the verb was one of a class of verbs that are likely to
be stative.
We also developed a set of features describing the
relative position of the clause in the story (Bin-
Position, FirstClause, LastClause), because differ-
ent story regions are often associated with different

clause types. For example, in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, the
beginning of the story contains more ORIENTATION
clauses, while ACTION clauses are concentrated in
the middle of the story. The EVALUATION clauses
typically occur part-way through the story where
they provide the narrator?s reaction to story events.
See Table 2.
In total there were 3,510 unique binary valued fea-
tures extracted from our training dataset. We used
mutual information to find the features that had the
highest correlation with each category and the in-
formation gain over all the labels. The 10 highest
valued features are in Table 3, e.g. the top feature is
when the part-of-speech (POS) of the main verb in
the independent clause (IND) is past tense (VBD).
This feature encoding was used for machine learn-
ing experiments with classification algorithms from
Mallet (McCallum, 2002): Naive Bayes (NB) (Wit-
ten and Frank, 2005), Confidence Weighted Linear
Classifier (CWLC) (Dredze et al., 2008), Maximum
Entropy (ME)(Witten and Frank, 2005) and a se-
quential classifier (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).
5 Evaluation and Results
We evaluate the performance of our classifiers with
experiments using the 50 annotated stories. Us-
ing the 40 stories in the training set we calculated
the information gain for each feature (see Table 3).
For each subset of the highest valued features (in
the range of 2
2
-2
12
), we performed a 10-fold cross-
validation on the training data and assessed the per-
formance of each classifier to find the right number
of features. Within each fold of the cross-validation
we also perform a simple grid search for the optimal
hyper-parameters of the model (e.g., the prior in the
ME and CRF models) using only the data within the
training fold.
The feature selection experimental results are

shown in Table 4. We report the optimal number
of features and the corresponding macro F-score,
weighted by the relative frequency of each category,
for each algorithm and label set. For all algorithms,
performance increases for label sets with higher lev-
els of abstraction. The Naive Bayes and CRF mod-
els perform better with a small subset of the fea-
tures, while the ME and CWLC algorithms use a
much larger subset. Surprisingly the sequential clas-
sifier has the lowest F-score and Naive Bayes per-
forms the best. A

ment over CRF at p < 0.05 using a two-sided t-test.
No other differences were significant.
Using the optimal number of features obtained
from this search we trained a model for each algo-
rithm using the entire training dataset and selecting
the hyper-parameters as before. We applied these
models to the unseen test data and evaluated the per-
formance of each classifier as applied to the entire
set of clauses and to individual narratives.
We first computed the precision, recall and F-score
aggregated over all the clauses in the test set. Ta-
ble 5 summarizes the results for each classifier and
label set. The left hand side of the table shows the
macro precision, recall and F-score weighted by the
relative frequency of each label. The right hand
side of the table shows the F-score of each indi-
vidual label separately. On this evaluation, Naive
Bayes outperforms all other methods on all label
sets. Overall, precision and recall are relatively bal-
anced achieving a maximum F-score of 0.689 when
the labels are mapped back to the original L&W cat-
egories. The CRF does surprisingly well consider-
ing its poor performance during the feature selection
search. The classifiers perform the poorest on orien-
tation clauses and the best on evaluation clauses.
As mentioned above, the annotation task is highly
subjective, requiring interpreting the narrative and
the author?s intention, which prevents us from ob-
taining high levels of inter-rater agreement. Because
of the noise in the annotations, the standard evalua-

tion metrics may hide information about the ability
of the classifiers to learn from our feature set. For
example, the best performing classifier (NB) incor-
rectly labeled 127 clauses out of 430 possible in the
test set. However, 44 of these errors agreed with
at least one annotator, but were counted as entirely
incorrect in the previous evaluations.
To address these concerns we also evaluated the
performance of the the best performing classifier
based on the level of agreement of each instance us-
ing two different approaches. See Table 6. The first
approach was inspired by the approach in (Louis
and Nenkova, 2011) where the clauses in the test
set are binned based on the number of annotators
who agreed with the gold standard label. The per-
formance is then calculated for each bin. The first
three rows of Table 6 show the performance for the
different levels of agreement in the dataset. There
were only 15 clauses in the test set where there was
no agreement at all. It is unsurprising that when
the annotators could not agree on a label the sys-
tem performed near chance levels. However, when
all three annotators agreed on the gold standard
label the F-score improved to 0.767. As a compar-
ison, the F-score of the entire test set was 0.689 as
shown in the row labeled All.
Our second approach is based on the proposal of

tervals over the 10 narratives.
The CWLC performed the best on this test and
the performance of all the algorithms generally im-
proved using the higher-level label sets. The results
also show that there is a high variance in perfor-
mance between stories, with a minimum F-score of
0.458 and a maximum of 0.877 for the CWLC on
the L&W label set. This indicates that some clauses
are ambiguous and difficult to label, but also that
some stories are more difficult to classify.
To assess whether more annotated data could im-
prove performance, we ran a series of learning
curves in Fig. 2. Only the training data was used
for these experiments. The curves were created by
randomly sampling 90% of the data for training and
10% for testing. A model was trained, using the
same process as above, on successively larger sub-
sets of the data and applied to the 10% held out
clauses. This process was repeated 10 times and the
mean F-Score is reported. In nearly all cases, the
performance of classifiers is still increasing when
all of the data is used indicating that we have not
exhausted the expressive power of our features and
more annotated data would be useful. However, we
also see we can reach about 93% of our maximum
performance with only a few hundred examples. We
plan to increase the size of our annotated data set in
future work.
5.1 Error Analysis
Our results to date indicate that we achieve an over-
all F-score of 0.689, and that our classifiers are most
accurate for the evaluation and action categories.
See Table 6. Fig. 3 presents a confusion matrix

showing the frequency of predicted labels against
the gold standard labels for the Naive Bayes classi-
fier on the L&W label set. With the exception of not
story there are cases of confusion between all cate-
gories. However, in the vast majority of cases both
action and orientation are confused with evaluation
and the classifier overpredicts evaluation.
We also categorized errors for the Naive Bayes
classifier into the the 4 sources of errors in the pre-
dictions shown in Table 8. The most common errors
involved clauses with lexical INDICATORS that are
highly correlated with one category, but in the con-
text and interpretation of the story actually function
as a different type. For example, unfortunately,
could and n?t are all strong indicators of evaluation,
but in this case the primary function of the clause
is to set the scene for the rest of the story, i.e., ori-
entation. The interpretation of these clauses is clear
to a human, despite the lexical items misleading the
classifier.
Another source of error is when the function of the
clause in the narrative is ambiguous (PURPOSE in
Table 8). While there may be some misleading lex-
ical indicators in these clauses, there were often no
strongly correlated words, such as the adjectives and
modal verbs in EVALUATIONS. The distinction in
these cases is that the primary function of the clause
within the story is unclear, even to a human reader.
Unsurprisingly, most of the examples in this cate-
gory had low inter-rater agreement.
Some of the clauses contain figurative language
or complex constructions that require a significant
amount of world knowledge and INFERENCE to in-
terpret. For example, understanding the INFERENCE
clause in Table 8 requires recognizing the metaphor
about rabbit food in order to identify the subjective
evaluation the narrator is making.
There are also cases of clauses that contain MULTI-
PLE categories, at least partially because of the gran-
ularity of our segmentation. In the example in Ta-
ble 8 a new character, Alejandrio, is introduced and
a rising action is described, trekking to the waterfall.

Our annotation guidelines instructed us to prefer ac-
tions in these types of clauses, however, both ORI-
ENTATION and ACTION are present in this situation.
There were also 39 clauses that were labeled in-
correctly that had no clear reason (UNCLEAR) for
being mislabelled. We also explicitly excluded the
7 clauses marked not part of the story.
The types of errors described above are not mutu-
ally exclusive and in some cases are causally related.
For example, the purpose of a clause may be am-
biguous because it contains conflicting lexical indi-
cators. Similarly, a clause containing multiple cate-
gories will likely have strong lexical indicators from
each of these categories so that the classification al-
gorithms cannot disambiguate among possible la-
bels. This might be improved by more data, more
sophisticated semantic features, or possibly an anal-
ysis focused on discourse relations, such as those in
the PDTB (Louis et al., 2010; Prasad et al., 2008),
or Elson?s STORY INTENTION GRAPH (Rishes et al.,
2013; Elson and McKeown, 2010; Elson, 2012).
6 Discussion
This paper describes work on categorization of nar-
rative clauses based on Labov & Waletzky?s theory
of oral narrative, applied to personal narratives writ-
ten by ordinary people. We show that we can auto-
matically classify narrative clauses with these cate-
gories achieving an overall F-score of 0.689, which
is substantially higher than a random (0.250) or ma-
jority class (0.437) baseline, which increases to an
F-score of .767 on the cases where all three annota-
tors agreed. The learning curves plotted in Fig. 2
clearly suggest that more training data would be
beneficial before we investigate more complex fea-
tures and learning algorithms.
We believe the ability to automatically perform this
type of simple narrative analysis will enable and
improve many other types of deeper narrative un-
derstanding (Rahimtoroghi et al., 2014; Hu et al.,
2013). For example, causal and temporal relation-
ship extraction methods that focus only on clauses in
the same action sequence be more accurate, because
they exclude disconnected events from the orienta-
tion or evaluation sections. This type of analysis
will also enable new methods for learning attitudes
and values of societal groups based on the different
affective evaluations that are provided in response
to action clauses.
Our results also highlight several properties of the
data. Performance is different for results by story
rather than over all clauses. This indicates that
some stories are more difficult to classify than oth-
ers and that ambiguous clauses are not uniformly
distributed but are likely to be correlated with par-
ticular authors or writing styles. In other work, we
have started to investigate whether we can automat-
ically rate the temporal coherence of personal narra-
tives (Ryan et al., 2014). We can use this to identify
stories with utterances that are likely to be difficult
to classify because of the poor quality of the narra-
tive input. These cases are unlikely to have usable
narrative structure.

Abstract
Today was a very eventful work day.
2
Orientation
Today was the start of the G20 summit.
3
Orientation
It happens every year
4
Orientation
and it is where 20 of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run their
governments effectively and what not.
5
Orientation
Since there are so many leaders coming together their are going to be a lot of people who
have different views on how to run the government they follow so they protest.
6
Orientation
This week things started alright and on schedule.
7
Action
There was a protest that happened along the street where I work
8
Action
and at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling
9
Action
and creating a riot.
10
Action
Police cars were burned
11
Action
and things were thrown at cops.
12
Orientation
Police were in full riot gear to alleviate the violence.
13
Action
As things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the rioters
14
Action
while they smash windows of stores.
15
Evaluation
And this all happened right in front of my store
16
Evaluation
which was kind of scary
17
Evaluation
but it was kind of interesting
18
Coda
since I?ve never seen a riot before.
