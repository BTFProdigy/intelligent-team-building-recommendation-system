Abstract
We describe our contribution to the Gen-
eration Challenge 2010 for the tasks
of Named Entity Recognition and co-
reference detection (GREC-NER). To ex-
tract the NE and the referring expressions,
we employ a combination of a Part of
Speech Tagger and the Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) learning technique. We
finally experiment an original algorithm
to detect co-references. We conclude
with discussion about our system perfor-
mances.
1 Introduction
Three submission tracks are proposed in Genera-
tion Challenges 2010. GREC-NEG, where partic-
ipating systems select a referring expression (RE)
from a given list. GREC-NER where partic-
ipating systems must recognize all mentions of
people in a text and identify which mentions co-
refer. And GREC-Full, end-to-end RE regener-
ation task; participating systems must identify all
mentions of people and then aim to generate im-
proved REs for the mentions. In this paper we
present an unsupervised CRF based Named Entity
Recognition (NER) system applied to the GREC-
NER Task.
2 System description
The proposed system follows a pipelined architec-
ture (each module processes the information pro-
vided by the previous one). First, a Part of Speech
(POS) tagger is applied to the corpus. Then, the
combination of words and POS tags are used by
a CRF classifier to detect Named Entities (NE).
Next, logical rules based on combination of POS
tags, words and NE labels are used to detect pro-
nouns related to persons. Finally, an algorithm
1This work is granted by Unima Inc and Prompt Que?bec
identifies, among the person entities that have
been detected, the ones that co-refer and cluster
them. At the end, all collected information is ag-
gregated in a XML file conform to GREC-NER
specifications.
2.1 Part of speech
The part of speech labeling is done with the En-
glish version of Treetagger1. It is completed by
a step where every NAM tag associated to a first
nname is replaced by a FNAME tag, using a lex-
ical resource of first names (see table 2, column
POS Tag). The first name tag improves the NE
detection model while it improves the estimation
of conditional probabilities for words describing a
person, encountered by a NER system.

The Named Entity Recognition (NER) system
is an implementation of the CRF based system
(Be?chet and Charton, 2010) that has been used
in the French NER evaluation campaign ESTER
2 (Galliano et al, 2009)2. For the present task,
training of the NER tool is fully unsupervised as
it does not use the GREC training corpus. It is
trained in English with an automatically NE an-
notated version of the Wikipedia Corpus (the full
system configuration is described in (Charton and

ORG, LOC, TIME, DATE. We measured a spe-
cific precision of 0,93 on PERS NE detection ap-
plied to the English ACE4 evaluation set.
Following the NE detection process, detection
rules are used to label each personal pronoun with
the PERS tag. Boolean AND rules are applied
to triples {word, POS tag, NE tag}, where word
= {he, him, she, her ...}, POS tag=NN, and NE
tag=UNK . This rule structure is adopted to avoid
the PERS labeling of pronouns included in an ex-
pression or in a previously tagged NE (i.e a music
album or a movie title, using word She, and pre-
viously labeled with PROD NE tag). Finally, each
PERS labeled entity is numbered by order of ap-
parition and is associated with the sentences refer-
ence number where it appears (consecutive PERS
labeled words, not separated by punctuation mark,
receive the same index number).
2.3 Entities clustering by unstacking
In the final stage, our system determines which
entities co-refer. First, a clustering process is
achieved. The principle of the algorithm is as
follows: entities characteristics (words, POS tags,
sentence position) are indexed in a stack, ordered
according to their chronological apparition in the
text (the entity at the top of the stack is the first one
that has been detected in the document). At the
beginning of the process, the entity that is at the
top of the stack is removed and constitutes the first
item of a cluster. This entity is compared sequen-
tially, by using similarity rules, with every other
entities contained in the stack. When there is a
match, entity is transfered to the currently instan-
tiated cluster and removed from the stack. When
the end of the stack is reached, remaining entities
are reordered and the process iterates form the be-
ginning. This operation is repeated until the stack
is empty.
Comparison of entities in the stack is done in

two ways according to the nature of the entity.
We consider a candidate entity Ec from stack
S. According to iteration k, the current clus-
ter is Ck. Each element of the sequence Ec (i.e
Chester FNAME Carton NAM) is compared to the
sequences previously transfered in Ck during the
exploration process of the stack. If Ec ?
?
Ck, it
is included in cluster Ck and removed from S. Fi-
nally inclusion of pronouns from S in Ec is done
by resolving the anaphora, according to the Hobbs
algorithm, as described in (Jurafsky et al, 2000)5.
3 Results and conclusions
Table 1 shows our results on dev-set. We ob-
tain good precision on the 3 subsets. Our system
slightly underperforms the recall. This can be ex-
plained by a good performance in the NE detection
process, but a difficulty in some cases for the clus-
tering algorithm to group entities. We have ob-
served in the Inventors dev-set some difficulties,
due to strong variation of surface forms for spe-
cific entities. We plan to experiment the use of
an external resource of surface forms for person
names extracted from Wikipedia to improve our
system in such specific case.

Abstract
This paper presents the coreference resolution
system Poly-co submitted to the closed track
of the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task. Our sys-
tem integrates a multilayer perceptron classi-
fier in a pipeline approach. We describe the
heuristic used to select the pairs of corefer-
ence candidates that are feeded to the network
for training, and our feature selection method.
The features used in our approach are based on
similarity and identity measures, filtering in-
formations, like gender and number, and other
syntactic information.
1 Introduction
Coreference resolution is the process of determining
whether two expressions in natural language refer to
the same entity in the world. It is an important sub-
task in natural language processing systems. In this
paper, we present a learning approach to coreference
resolution of named entities (NE), pronouns (PRP),
noun phrases (NP) in unrestricted text according to
the CoNLL-2011 shared task (Pradhan et al, 2011).
This system have been used in the context of closed
track.
2 Previous propositions
Many learning-based systems have been proposed to
solve coreference resolution task, and Soon?s (Soon
et al, 2001) architecture is one of the most pop-
ular ones. In this proposition, all possible men-
tions in a training document are determined by a
pipeline of natural language processing (NLP) mod-
ules. Then, training examples are generated as fea-
ture vectors. Each feature vector represents a pair
of mentions that can potentially corefer. Those vec-
tors are used as training examples given to build a
C5 classifier. To determine the coreference chains
in a new document, all potential pairs of corefer-
ring mentions are presented to the classifier, which
decides whether the two mentions actually core-
fer. Since then, this dominant architecture has been
widely implemented. As it is a very flexible propo-
sition, many families of classifiers have been used,
trained with various configurations of feature vec-
tors. Good results are obtained with SVM classi-
fiers, like described in (Versley et al, 2008). Some
propositions keep only the principle of feature vec-
tors, associated with more complex coreference de-
tection algorithms. A constraint-based graph parti-
tioning system has been experimented by (Sapena et
al., 2010) and a coreference detection system based
on Markov logic networks (MLNs) has been pro-
posed by (Poon and Domingos, 2008).
3 Architecture of the proposed system
A considerable engineering effort is needed to
achieve the coreference resolution task. A signif-
icant part of this effort concerns feature engineer-
ing. We decided to keep the well established archi-
tecture of (Soon et al, 2001) with a pre-processing
NLP pipeline used to prepare pairs of coreference
features. The features are then submitted to the clas-
sifier for pairing validation. We tested various clas-
sifiers on our feature model (see table 2) and fi-
nally selected a multilayer perceptron (MLP) clas-
sifier to make decision. Since the Ontonotes layers
provide syntactic information (Pradhan et al, 2007),

we could concentrate our efforts on the introduction
of some complementary high level properties (like
mention similarities or gender compatibility) used
in the feature vectors given to the classifiers. The
global architecture, presented in figure 1, includes
two pipelines. One configured for training purposes
and the other one for coreference resolution.
3.1 Architecture components
Ontonotes corpus includes part-of-speech tagging,
noun phrases identification and named entity labels.
We introduce complementary modules to detect gen-
der and number, and evaluate mentions aliasing and
similarity. The detection task is composed of 4 mod-
ules:
? Candidate mentions detection module, based
on extraction rules, using Ontonotes layers.
? Named entities alias detection module, based
on the previous version of Poly-co, described
in (Charton et al, 2010). The purpose of this
module is to identify variations in names of
the same entity by examination of their surface
form.
? Similarity calculation module, used to evalu-
ate the similarity of two mentions according to
a comparison of their string.
? Gender and number detection module,
which determines gender and number for any
candidate mention.
In the training pipeline, the candidate mentions
detection module and the alias detection module
are replaced by a unique candidate mentions ex-
traction module. This module collects from the
training corpus the labeled mentions and their refer-
ence numbers and use them to generate aliases and
mentions values required to build training features.
As we will see later, similarity calculation and
gender and number detection all result in a value that
is integrated to the feature vector used to train and
apply the classifier. We give below a more detailed
description of each module.
3.1.1 Candidate mentions detection module
It is mandatory for coreference resolution to first
get al the potential mentions from the input text.
To determine the mentions, this module explores the
text corpus and extracts a candidate mentions list.
This list includes, for each mention, its position in
the document, its word content and its syntactic cat-
egory. This module uses simple detection rules to
collect the mentions according to their part of speech
(POS) and their text content, their syntactic bound-
aries and their named entity type labels.
When used in classification mode, the detection
process is followed by a filtering process, where
rules are used to remove mentions that have a very
low probability of being involved in coreference.
These rules are based on simple word sequence pat-
terns. For example, pronoun it is filtered out when
immediately followed by verb to be and relative pro-
noun that within the next 6 following words.
3.1.2 Alias detection module
This module implements an algorithm that clus-
ters entities by comparing the form of their names.
Entities are put in a list, ordered according to their
chronological apparition in the text. At the begin-
ning of the process, the first entity in the list is re-
moved and constitutes the first item of a cluster. This
entity is compared sequentially, by using similarity
and logical rules (i.e, a PERSON can?t be an alias of
a LOC ), with every other entities contained in the
98
list. When there is a match, the entity is removed
from the list and transferred to the currently instan-
tiated cluster. This operation is repeated until the list
is empty.
At the end of this process, an entity in a cluster is
considered to be an alias of every other entity in the
same cluster.
The TIME and DATE alias detection is done
through a specific heuristic set. Each TIME entity
representation is converted in a standardized format
(Hour/Minutes). Dates are normalized as a relative
amount of days (?today? is 1, ?last month? is -30,
etc) or a formal date (Year/Month/Day).
3.1.3 Similarity calculation module
The similarity module is applied on named enti-
ties (excepted TIME and DATE ) and NP of the
candidate mentions list. It consists in a text com-
parison function which returns the number of com-
mon words between two mentions. After execution
of this module, we obtain a square matrix containing
a similarity measure for every pair of mentions.
3.1.4 Gender and number detection module
Gender and number are associated with each entry
of the candidate mentions list, including PRP and
NP. First, this module tries to detect the gender using
the gender data provided1. Then a set of less than
10 very simple rules is used to avoid anomaly (i.e a
PERSON entity associated with the neutral gender).
Another set of rules using plural markers of words
and POS is used to validate the number.
4 Features definition and production
The feature vector of the Poly-co system (see ta-
ble 1) consists of a 22 features set, described below.
This vector is based on two extracted mentions, A
and B, where B is the potential antecedent and A is
the anaphor.
Four features are common to A and B (section A
and B properties of table 1):
? IsAlias : this value is binary (yes or no) and
provided by the alias module. The value is yes
if A and B have been identified as describing
the same entity.

? Distance : this indicates the offset distance (in
terms of number of items in the candidate men-
tions list) between A and B.
? Sent : this indicates the amount of sentences
marker (like . ! ?) separating the mentions A
and B.
For each candidate A and B, a set containing nine
features is added to the vector (in table 1, only prop-
erties for A are presented). First, 3 flags determine
if mention is a named entity (IsNE), a personal pro-
noun (IsPRP) or a noun phrase (IsNP). The next six
flags define the characteristics of the mention :
? NE SEMANTIC TYPE is one of the 18 available
NE types (PERSON, ORG, TIME, etc)
? PRP NAME is a value representing 30 possible
words (like my, she, it, etc) for a PRP.
? NP NAME is a value indicating the DT used by
a NP (like the, this, these, etc).
? NP TYPE specifies if NP is demonstrative, def-
inite, or a quantifier.
? GENDER and NUMBER flags indicate whether
the mention gender (Male, Female or Neutral)

to be defined (i.e PRP flag if the mention is a NE).
5 Classifier training and use
For training, we use an algorithm that selects the
more relevant pairs or mentions. Suppose that
the candidate mentions list contains k mentions
M1,M2, . . . ,Mk, in this order in the document. The
algorithm starts with the last mention in the docu-
ment, that is, Mk. It compares Mk sequentially with
preceding mentions, going backward until a core-
ferring mention Mc is reached, or a maximum of n
mentions have been visited (the value of n is fixed to
10 in our experiments). When a coreferring mention
Mc has been found, a vector is constructed for every
pair of mentions ?Mk,Mi?, where Mi is a mention
that has been visited, including the coreferring one.
These vectors are added to the training set, Mc being
a positive instance, and all the others ones being neg-
ative instances. The process is repeated with Mk?1,
and so on, until every mention has been processed.
If none of the n precedent mentions are coreferent
to M1, all the n pairs are rejected and not used as
training instance.
During the coreference detection process, a sim-
ilar algorithm is used. Starting from mention Mk,
we compare it with n preceding mentions, until we
find one for which the multilayer perceptron classi-
fier gives a coreference probability higher than 0.52.
If none is found within the limit of n mentions, Mk

is considered as a non coreferring mention. When
this has been done for every mention in the docu-
ment, the detected coreferences are used to construct
the coreference chains.
6 Results
The results presented on table 2 are obtained on the
dev-set of the Ontonotes corpus. To evaluate the po-
tential of our features model, we trained our sys-
tem with MLP, SVM and J48 Tree classifiers. We
finally chose the MLP models for the test evalua-
tion due to its better performance on the predicted
dev-set. However, according to the small difference
between MLP and J48 Tree, it?s difficult to define
clearly wich one is the best choice.
7 Conclusions
We presented Poly-co, a system for coreference res-
olution in English easy to adapt to other languages.
The first version of Poly-co was built to detect only
coreferences of persons. As the dataset provided for
CoNLL is much more complex, it was an intersting
opportunity to evaluate our mention detection algo-
rithms in the perspective of a full task, including dif-
ficult coreferences mentions beetween named enti-
ties, noun phrases and prepositions. Our comparison
of various classifier results on dev-sets have shown
that our proposition to use a multilayer perceptron as
coreference chain builder can be an intersting solu-
tion, but does not introduce an important difference
of performance with previously experimented clas-
sifiers.
