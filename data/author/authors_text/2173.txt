Abstract 
The work1 we present here is concerned 
with the acquisition of deep grammati-
cal information for nouns in Spanish. 
The aim is to build a learner that can 
handle noise, but, more interestingly, 
that is able to overcome the problem of 
sparse data, especially important in the 
case of nouns. We have based our work 
on two main points. Firstly, we have 
used distributional evidences as fea-
tures. Secondly, we made the learner 
deal with all occurrences of a word as a 
single complex unit. The obtained re-
sults show that grammatical features of 
nouns is a level of generalization that 
can be successfully approached with a 
Decision Tree learner. 
1 Introduction 
Our work aims to the acquisition of deep gram-
matical information for nouns, because having in-
formation such as countability and complementa-
tion is necessary for different applications, espe-
cially for deep analysis grammars, but also for 
question answering, topic detection and tracking, 
etc.  
Most successful systems of deep lexical acquisi-
tion are based on the idea that distributional fea-
tures (i.e. the contexts where words occur) are as-
sociated to concrete lexical  types. The difficulties 
                                                          
1 This research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci?n y Cien-
cia: project AAILE, HUM2004-05111-C02-01/FILO, Ram?n y Cajal, Juan de la 
Cierva Programs and PTA-CTE/1370/2003 with Fondo Social Europeo,. 
are, on the one hand, that some filtering must be 
applied to get rid of noise, that is, contexts wrongly 
assessed as cues of a given type and, on the other 
hand, that for a pretty large number of words, their  
occurrences in a corpus of any length are very few, 
making statistical treatment very difficult. 
The phenomenon of noise is related to the fact 
that one particular context can be a cue of different 
lexical types. The problem of sparse data is pre-
dicted by the Zipfian distribution of words in texts: 
there is a large number of words likely to occur a 
very reduced number of times in any corpus. Both 
of these typical problems are maximized in the 
case of nouns.  
The aim of the work we present here is to build 
a learner that can handle noise, but, more interest-
ingly, that is able to overcome the problem of 
sparse data. The learner must predict the correct 
type both when there is a large number of occur-
rences as well as when there are only few occur-
rences, by learning on features that maximize gen-
eralization capacities of the learner while control-
ling overfitting phenomena.  
We have based our work on two main points. 
Firstly, we have used morphosyntactic information 
as features. Secondly, we made the learner deal 
with all occurrences of a word as a complex unit. 
In our system, linguistic cues of every occurrence 
are collected in the signature of the word (more 
technically a pair lema + part of speech) in a par-
ticular corpus. In the next sections we give further 
details about the features used, as well as about the 
use of signatures. 
The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 
presents an overview of the state of the art in deep 
lexical acquisition. In section 3, we introduce de-
tails about our selection of linguistically motivated 
5
cues to be used as features for training a Decision 
Tree (DT). Section 4 shortly introduces the meth-
odology and data used in the experiments whose 
results are presented in section 5. And in section 6 
we conclude by comparing with the published re-
sults for similar tasks and we sketch future re-
search.  
2 State of the art 
Most of the work on deep lexical information 
acquisition has been devoted to verbs. The existing 
acquisition systems learn very specialized linguis-
tic information such as verb subcategorization 
frame2. The results for verb subcategorization are 
mostly around the 0.8 of precision. Briscoe & Car-
roll (1997) reported a type precision of 0,76 and a 
type recall of 0.43. Their results were improved by 
the work of Korhonen (2002) with a type precision 
of 0.87 and a recall of 0.68 using external re-
sources to filter noise. Shulte im Walde (2002) re-
ports a precision of 0.65 and a recall of 0.58. 
Chesley & Salmon-Alt (2006) report a precision of 
0.86 and a recall of 0.54 for verb subcategorization 
acquisition for French.  
Lexical acquisition for nouns has been con-
cerned mainly with ontological classes and has 
mainly worked on measuring semantic similarity 
on the basis of occurrence contexts. As for gram-
matical information, the work of Baldwin and 
Bond (2003) in acquisition of countability features 
for English nouns also tackles the very important 
problem of feature selection. Other work like Car-
roll and Fang?s (2004) and Baldwin?s (2005) have 
focused on grammatical information acquisition 
for HPSG based computational grammars. The 
latter is the most similar exercises to our work. 
Baldwin (2005) reports his better results in terms 
of type accuracy has been obtained by using syn-
tactic information in a chunked and parsed corpus. 
The type F-scores for the different tested catego-
ries for English were: for verbs 0.47, for nouns 0.6  
and for adjectives 0.832.  
3 Feature selection  
One of the most important tasks in developing 
machine learning applications is the selection of 
                                                          
2 Given the argument-adjunct distinction, subcategorization 
concerns the specification for a predicate of the number and 
type of arguments which it requires for well-formedness. 
the features that leads to the smallest classification 
error. For our system, we have looked at distribu-
tional motivated features that can help in discrimi-
nating the different types that we ultimately use to 
classify words.  
The lexical types used in deep analysis gram-
mars are linguistic generalizations drawn from the 
distributional characteristics of particular sets of 
words. For the research we present here, we have 
taken the lexicon of a HPSG-based grammars de-
veloped in the LKB platform (Copestake, 2002) for 
Spanish, similarly to the work of Baldwin (2005). 
In the LKB grammatical framework, lexical types 
are defined as a combination of features. Lexical 
typology of nouns for Spanish, for instance, can be 
seen as a cross-classification of noun countability 
vs. mass distinctions, and subcategorization frame 
or valence, including prepositional selection.  For 
example nouns as ?temor? (?fear?) and ?adicci?n? 
(?adiction) belong to the type 
n_ppde_pcomp_a_count as they take two com-
plements: one with de and the other with a bound 
preposition a, as in ?El temor de la ni?a a los fan-
tasmas? (?The girl?s fear to ghosts?) vs. ?La adic-
ci?n a la coca?na? (?The addiction to cocaine?).  
We decided to carry out the classification for 
each of the grammatical features that conform the 
cross-classified types as a better level of generali-
zation than the type: mass and countable, on the 
one hand and, on the other hand, for subcategoriza-
tion information three further basic features: trans, 
for nouns with thematic complements introduced 
by the preposition de, intrans, when the noun can 
appear with no complements and pcomp for nouns 
having complements introduced by a bound prepo-
sition. The complete type can be recomposed with 
the assigned features. ?Temor? and ?adicci?n? will 
be examples of trans and pcomp_a. They both 
have also to be assigned the feature countable. The 
combination of features assigned corresponds to 
the final type which is a definition of the complete 
behaviour of the noun with respect, for instance, 
optional complements.  
We have used 23 linguistic cues, that is, the pat-
terns of contexts that can be indicative of a particu-
lar feature. The most frequent cue that can be re-
lated to countable is for the noun to be found with 
plural morphology. A singular noun without de-
terminer after a verb or a preposition is a cue of the 
noun being mass: ?hay barro en el sal?n? (?there is 
mud in the living room?) vs. ?hay hombres en el 
6
sal?n? (?there are men in the living room?). A fur-
ther cue for mass is the presence of particular 
quantifiers, such as ?m?s? (?more?), ?menos? 
(?less?), etc. But these cues, based on a collection 
of lexical items, are less productive than other 
characteristics such as morphological number or 
presence of determiners, as they appear very 
scarcely in texts. Nevertheless, we should mention 
that most of mass nouns in Spanish can also appear 
in the contexts of countables, as in the case of 
?beer? when in constructions such as ?three beers, 
please?.   
More difficult was to find cues for identifying 
the transitive nature of a noun. After some empiri-
cal work, we found a tendency of argumental com-
plements to have a definite article: ?temor de la 
ni?a? (?fear of the girl?), while modifiers tend to 
appear without determiners: ?mesa de juegos? (?ta-
ble of games?). Besides, we have taken as a cue the 
morphological characteristics of deverbal nouns. 
Suffixes such as ?-ci?n?, ?-si?n?, and ?-miento?, 
are very much indicative of transitive nouns. Fi-
nally, to find the bound preposition of comple-
ments, we used a pattern for each possible preposi-
tion found after the noun in question. 
We used Regular Expressions to implement the 
linguistic motivated patterns that check for the in-
formation just mentioned in a part of speech tagged 
corpus. The various patterns determine whether the 
linguistic cues that we have related to syntactic 
features are found in each occurrence of a particu-
lar word in a corpus. The positive or negative re-
sults of the n pattern checking are stored as binary 
values of a n dimensional vector, one for each oc-
currence. All vectors produced, one per occurrence 
of the word in question, are stored then in a kind of 
vector of vectors that we have called its signature.  
The term signature wants to capture the notion that 
the data it embodies is truly representative of a par-
ticular item, and that shows the details of its typical 
behavior. Particularly, we wanted linguistic cues 
appearing in different occurrences of the same 
word to be observed as related information. We 
have not dealt with ambiguity at all, however. One 
of the reasons was our focus on low frequency 
nouns. 
4 Methodology and data 
We have worked with the Corpus T?cnic de 
l?IULA, a multilingual part of speech tagged corpus 
which consists of domain specific texts. The sec-
tion used for our evaluation was the Spanish with 
1,091,314 words in the domain of economy and 
4,301,096 for medicine. A dataset of 289 nouns, 
present in both subcorpora, was selected. It was 
important to compare the behavior of the same 
nouns in both corpus to check whether the learner 
was subject to unwanted overfitting.  
We used the data for building a C4.5 DT clas-
sifier3. DT?s are one well known and successful 
technique for this class of tasks when there is 
enough pre-annotated data available. DT?s have 
the additional benefit that the results can be in-
spected. The signatures of the words in the Gold-
Standard lists were extracted from the corpus of 
medicine and of the economy one. There was a 
further test set of 50 nouns with a single occur-
rence in the corpus of economy for testing pur-
poses. The DT was trained with the signatures of 
the economy corpus, and the medicine ones as well 
as the singles set were used for testing.  
5 Evaluation 
The purpose of the evaluation was to validate our 
system with respect to the two problems men-
tioned: noise filtering and generalization capacity 
by measuring type precision and type recall. We 
understand type precision as a measure of the noise 
filtering success, and recall as a measure of the 
generalization capacity.  
In the following tables we present the results of 
the different experiments. In Table 1, there is a 
view of the results of the experiment after training 
and testing with the signatures got in the smaller 
corpus. The results are for the assignment of the 
grammatical feature for the two values, yes and no. 
And the column named global refers to the total 
percentage of correctly classified instances.

The most difficult task for the learner is to iden-
tify nouns with bound prepositions. Note that there 
are only 20 nouns with prepositional complements 
of the 289 test nouns, and that the occurrence of 
the preposition is not mandatory, and hence the 
signatures are presented to the learner with very 
little information.  
Table 2 shows the results for 50 nouns with only 
one occurrence in the corpus. The performance 
does not change significantly, showing that the 
generalization capacity of the learner can cope 
with low frequency words, and that noise in larger 
signatures has been adequately filtered.

Table 3 shows that there is little variation in the 
results of training with signatures of the economy 
corpus and testing with ones of the medicine cor-
pus. As expected, no variation due to domain is 
relevant as the information learnt should be valid 
in all domains.

natures and testing with medicine signatures 
6  Conclusions 
The obtained results show that the learning of 
grammatical features of nouns are learned success-
fully when using distributional linguistic informa-
tion as learning features that allow the learner to 
generalize so as to maintain the performance in 
cases of nouns with just one occurrence.  
There are however issues that should be further 
investigated. Grammatical features with low preci-
sion and recall results (mass and pcomp) show that 
some more research should be carried out for find-
ing relevant linguistic cues to be used as learning 
features. In that respect, the local cues based on 
morphosyntactic tagging have proved to be useful, 
minimizing the text preprocessing requirements for 
getting usable results.

Abstract 
This paper describes work on the develop-
ment of an open-source HPSG grammar for 
Spanish implemented within the LKB sys-
tem. Following a brief description of the 
main features of the grammar, we present 
our approach for pre-processing and on-
going research on automatic lexical acqui-
sition.1   
1 Introduction 
In this paper we describe the development of the 
Spanish Resource Grammar (SRG), an open-
source 2  medium-coverage grammar for Spanish. 
The grammar is grounded in the theoretical 
framework of HPSG (Head-driven Phrase Struc-
ture Grammar; Pollard and Sag, 1994) and uses 
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) for the se-
mantic representation (Copestake et al 2006). The 
SRG is implemented within the Linguistic Knowl-
edge Building (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), 
based on the basic components of the grammar 
Matrix, an open?source starter-kit for the devel-
opment of HPSG grammars developed as part of 
the LinGO consortium?s multilingual grammar 
engineering (Bender et al, 2002).  
The SRG is part of the DELPH-IN open-source 
repository of linguistic resources and tools for 
writing (the LKB system), testing (The [incr 
tsbd()]; Oepen and Carroll, 2000) and efficiently

processing HPSG grammars (the PET system; 
Callmeier, 2000). Further linguistic resources that 
are available in the DELPH-IN repository include 
broad-coverage grammars for English, German and 
Japanese as well as  smaller grammars for French, 
Korean, Modern Greek, Norwegian and 
Portuguese .3   
The SRG has a full coverage of closed word 
classes and it contains about 50,000 lexical entries 
for open classes (roughtly: 6,600 verbs, 28,000 
nouns, 11,200 adjectives and 4,000 adverbs).  
These lexical entries are organized into a type 
hierachy of about 400 leaf types (defined by a type 
hierarchy of  around 5,500 types). The grammar 
also has 40 lexical rules to perform valence 
changing operations on lexical items and 84 
structure rules to combine words and phrases into 
larger constituents and to compositionally build up 
the semantic representation.  
We have been developing the SRG since 
January 2005. The range of linguistic phenomena 
that the grammar handles includes almost all types 
of subcategorization structures, valence 
alternations,  subordinate clauses, raising and 
control, determination,  null-subjects and 
impersonal constructions, compound tenses, 
modification,  passive constructions, comparatives 
and superlatives, cliticization, relative and 
interrogative clauses and sentential adjuncts, 
among others. 
Together with the linguistic resources (grammar 
and lexicon) we provide a set of controlled hand-
constructed test suites. The construction of the test 
suites plays a major role in the development of the 
SRG, since test suites provide a fine-grained diag-

nosis of grammar performance and they allow us to 
compare the SRG with other DELPH-IN gram-
mars. In building the test suites we aimed at (a) 
testing specific phenomena in isolation or in con-
trolled interaction, (b) providing test cases which 
show systematic and exhaustive variations over 
each phenomenon, including infrequent phenom-
ena and variations, (c) avoiding irrelevant variation 
(i.e. different instances of the same lexical type), (d) 
avoiding ambiguity, and (e) including negative or 
ungrammatical data. We have about 500 test cases 
which are distributed by linguistic phenomena (we 
have 17 files). Each test case includes a short lin-
guistic annotation describing the phenomenon and 
the number of expected results when more than 
one analysis cannot be avoided (e.g. testing op-
tionality). 
Test suites are not the only source of data we 
have used for testing the SRG. Hand-constructed 
sentences were complemented by real corpus cases 
from: (a) the Spanish questions from the Question 
Answering track at CLEF (CLEF-2003, CLEF-
2004, CLEF-2005 and CLEF-2006), and (b) the 
general sub-corpus of the Corpus T?cnic de 
l?IULA (IULA?s Technical Corpus; Cabr? and 
Bach, 2004); this sub-corpus includes newspaper 
articles and it has been set up for contrastive 
studies. CLEF cases include short queries showing 
little interaction of phenomena and an average of 
9.2 words; newspaper articles show a high level of 
syntactic complexity and interaction of phenomena, 
sentences are a bit longer, ranging up to 35 words. 
We are currently shifting to much more varied 
corpus data of the Corpus T?cnic de l?IULA, which 
includes specialized corpus of written text in the 
areas of computer science, environment, law, 
medicine and economics, collected from several 
sources, such as legal texts, textbooks, research 
reports, user manuals, ? In these texts sentence 
length may range up to 70 words.  
The rest of the paper describes the pre-
processing strategy we have adopted and on our 
on-going research on lexical acquisition. 
2 Pre-processing in the SRG 
Following previous experiments within the 
Advanced Linguistic Engineering Platform (ALEP) 
platform (Marimon, 2002), we have integrated a 
shallow processing tool, the FreeLing tool, as a 
pre-processing module of the grammar.  
The FreeLing tool is an open-source4 language 
analysis tool suite (Atserias et al, 2006) perfoming 
the following functionalities (though 
disambiguation, named entity classification and the 
last three functionalities have not been integrated):  
 
? Text tokenization (including MWU and 
contraction splitting). 
? Sentence splitting. 
? Morpho-syntactic analysis and 
disambiguation. 
n. 
                                                
? Named entity detection and classification. 
? Date/number/currency/ratios/physical 
magnitude (speed, weight, temperature, 
density, etc.) recognitio
? Chart-based shallow parsing. 
? WordNet-based sense annotation.  
? Dependency parsing.  
FreeLing also includes a guesser to deal with 
words which are not found in the lexicon by 
computing the probability of each possible PoS tag 
given the longest observed termination string for 
that word. Smoothing using probabilities of shorter 
termination strings is also performed. Details can 
be found in Brants (2000) and Samuelson (1993).  
Our system integrates the FreeLing tool by 
means of the LKB Simple PreProcessor Protocol 
(SPPP; http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbSppp), 
which assumes that a preprocessor runs as an 
external process to the LKB system, and uses the 
LKB inflectional rule component to convert the 
PoS tags delivered by the FreeLing tool into partial 
descriptions of feature structures. 
2.1 The integration of PoS tags 
The integration of the morpho-syntactic analysis in 
the LKB system using the SPPP protocol means 
defining inflectional rules that propagate the mor-
pho-syntactic information associated to full-forms, 
in the form of PoS tags, to the morpho-syntactic 
features of the lexical items. (1) shows the rule 
propagating the tag AQMS (adjective qualitative 
masculine singular) delivered by FreeLing. Note

http://www.garraf.epsevg.upc.es/freeling/.

that we use the tag as the rule identifier (i.e. the 
name of the inflectional rule in the LKB).  
(1) aqms :=  
 %suffix () 
 [SYNSEM.LOCAL[CAT adj, 
               AGR.PNG[PN 3sg, 
                     GEN masc]]] 
 
In Spanish, when the verb is in non-finite form, 
such as infinitive or gerund, or it is in the impera-
tive, clitics5 take the form of enclitics. That is, they 
are attached to the verb forming a unique word, 
e.g. hacerlo (hacer+lo; to do it), gustarle (gus-
tar+le; to like to him). FreeLing does not split 
verbs and pronouns, but uses complex tags that 
append the tags of each word. Thus, the form ha-
cerlo gets the tag VMN+PP3MSA (verb main in-
finitive + personal pronoun 3rd masculine singular 
accusative). In order to deal with these complex 
tags, the SRG includes a series of rules that build 
up the same type of linguistic structure as that one 
built up with the structure rules attaching affixes to 
the left of verbal heads. Since the application of 
these rules is based on the tag delivered by FreeL-
ing, they are included in the set of inflectional rules 
and they are applied after the set of rules dealing 
with complement cliticization.   
 Apart from avoiding the implementation of in-
flectional rules for such a highly inflected lan-
guage, the integration of the morpho-syntactic 
analysis tags will allow us to implement default 
lexical entries (i.e. lexical entry templates that are 
activated when the system cannot find a particular 
lexical entry to apply) on the basis of the category 
encoded to the lexical tag delivered by FreeLing, 
for virtually unlimited lexical coverage. 6
2.2 The integration of multiword expressions 
All multiword expressions in FreeLing are stored 
in a file. The format of the file is one multiword 
per line, having three fields each: form, lemma and 
PoS.7 (2) shows two examples of multiword fixed 
                                                 
                                                
5 Actually, Spanish weak pronouns are considered pronominal 
affixes rather than pronominal clitics. 
6 The use of underspecified default lexical entries in a 
highly lexicalized grammar, however, may increase 
ambiguity and overgeneration (Marimon and Bel, 
2004). 
7 FreeLing only handles continuous multiword expres-
sions. 
expressions; i.e. the ones that are fully lexicalized 
and never show morpho-syntactic variation, a 
trav?s de (through) and a buenas horas (finally). 
 
(2) a_trav?s_de a_trav?s_de SPS00 
   a_buenas_horas a_buenas_horas RG 
 
The multiword form field may admit lemmas in 
angle brackets, meaning that any form with that 
lemma will be a valid component for the multi-
word. Tags are specified directly or as a reference 
to the tag of some of the multiword components. 
(3) builds a multiword with both singular and plu-
ral forms  (apartado(s) de correos (P.O Box)). The 
tag of the multiform is that of its first form ($1) 
which starts with NC and takes the values for 
number depending on whether the form is singular 
or plural.  
 
(3) <apartado>_de_correos apar-
tado_de _correos \$1:NC 
 
Both fixed expressions and semi-fixed expres-
sions are integrated by means of the inflectional 
rules that we have described in the previous sub-
section and they are treated in the grammar as 
word complex with a single part of speech.  
2.3 The integration of messy details and 
named entities 
FreeLing identifies, classifies and, when appropri-
ate, normalizes special text constructions that may 
be considered peripheral to the lexicon, such as 
dates, numbers, currencies, ratios, physical magni-
tudes, etc.  FreeLing also identifies and classifies 
named entities (i.e. proper names); however, we do 
not activate the classification functionality, since 
high performance of that functionality is only 
achieved with PoS disambiguated contexts.   
To integrate these messy details and named enti-
ties into the grammar, we require special inflec-
tional rules and lexical entry templates for each 
text construction tag delivered by FreeLing. Some 
of these tags are: W for dates, Z for numbers, Zm 
for currencies, ... In order to define one single en-
try for each text construct, we identify the tag and 
the STEM feature. (4) shows the lexical entry for 
dates.8
 
8 Each lexical entry in the SRG consists of a unique identifier, 
a lexical type, an orthography and a semantic relation. 
107
 
(4)  
date := date_le & 
[STEM <?w?>, 
SYNSEM.LKEY.KEYREL.PRED time_n_rel] 
 
The integration of these messy details allows us 
to release the analysis process from certain tasks 
that may be reliably dealt with by shallow external 
components.  
3 Automatic Lexical Acquisition 
We have investigated Machine Learning (ML) 
methods applied to the acquisition of the informa-
tion contained in the lexicon of the SRG. 
ML applied to lexical acquisition is a very active 
area of work linked to deep linguistic analysis due 
to the central role that lexical information has in 
lexicalized grammars and the costs of hand-
crafting them. Korhonen (2002), Carroll and Fang 
(2004), Baldwin (2005), Blunsom and Baldwin 
(2006), and Zhang and Kordoni (2006) are just a 
few examples of reported research work on deep 
lexical acquisition. 
The most successful systems of lexical acquisi-
tion are based on the linguistic idea that the con-
texts where words occur are associated to particu-
lar lexical types. Although the methods are differ-
ent, most of the systems work upon the syntactic 
information on words as collected from a corpus, 
and they develop different techniques to decide 
whether this information is relevant for type as-
signment or it is noise, especially when there are 
just a few examples. In the LKB grammatical 
framework, lexical types are defined as a combina-
tion of grammatical features. For our research, we 
have looked at these morpho-syntactically moti-
vated features that can help in discriminating the 
different types that we will ultimately use to clas-
sify words. Thus, words are assigned a number of 
grammatical features, the ones that define the lexi-
cal types. 
Table 1 and Table 2 show the syntactic features 
that we use to characterize 6 types of adjectives 
and 7 types of nouns in Spanish, respectively.9 As 
can be observed, adjectives are cross-classified 
according to their syntactic position within the NP, 
i.e. (preN(ominal)) vs  postN(ominal), the possibil-
ity of co-occurring in predicative constructions 
                                                 
9 The SRG has 35 types for nouns and 44 types for adjectives. 
(pred) and being modified by degree adverbs (G), 
and their subcategorization frame (pcomp); 
whereas lexical types for nouns are basically de-
fined on the basis of the mass/countable distinction 
and valence information. Thus, an adjective like 
bonito (nice), belonging to the type a_qual_intr, 
may be found both in pre-nominal and post-
nominal position or in predicative constructions, it 
may also be modified by degree adverbs, this type 
of adjectives, however, does not take comple-
ments. Nouns belonging to the type n_intr_count, 
like muchacha (girl), are countable intransitive 
nouns.

Table 2. Some nominal types of the SRG 
 
We have investigated two methods to automati-
cally acquire such linguistic information for Span-
ish nouns and adjectives: a Bayesian model and a 
decision tree. The aim of working with these two 
methods was to compare their performance taking 
into account that while the decision tree gets the 
information from previously annotated data, the 
Bayesian method learns it from the linguistic ty-
pology as defined by the grammar. These methods 
are described in the following subsections.  
3.1 A Bayesian model for lexical acquisition 
We have used a Bayesian model of inductive learn-
ing for assigning grammatical features to words 
occurring in a corpus. Given a hypothesis space 
(the linguistic features of words according to its 
lexical type) and one or more occurrences of the 
108
word to classify, the learner evaluates all hypothe-
ses for word features and values by computing 
their posterior probabilities, proportional to the 
product of prior probabilities and likelihood.  
In order to obtain the likelihood, grammatical 
features are related to the expected contexts where 
their instances might appear. The linguistic typol-
ogy provides likelihood information that is the 
learner?s expectation about which contexts are 
likely to be observed given a particular hypothesis 
of a word type. This likelihood is used as a substi-
tute of the computations made by observing di-
rectly the data, which is what a supervised machine 
learning method does. As said, our aim was to 
compare these two strategies.   
The decision on a particular word is determined 
by averaging the predictions of all hypothesis 
weighted by their posterior probabilities. More 
technically, for each syntactic feature {sf1, sf2, ..., 
sfn} of the set SF (Syntactic Features) represented 
in the lexical typology, we define the goal of our 
system to be the assignment of a value, {no, yes}, 
that maximizes the result of a function f: ?? SF, 
where ? is the collection of its occurrences (? = 
{v1, v2, ..., vz}), each being a n-dimensional vector. 
The decision on value assignment is achieved by 
considering every occurrence as a cumulative evi-
dence in favour or against of having each syntactic 
feature. Thus, our function Z?(SF, ?), shown in (5), 
will assess how much relevant information is got 
from all the vectors. A further function, shown in 
(8), will decide on the maximal value in order to 
assign sfi,x. 
(5)  ?= z
j j
vxisfPxisfZ )|,(),,(' ?
 
To assess P(sfi,x|vj), we use (6), which is the ap-
plication of Bayes Rule for solving the estimation 
of the probability of a vector conditioned to a par-
ticular feature and value.

For solving (6), the prior P(sfi,x) is computed on 
the basis of a lexical typology too, assuming that 
what is more frequent in the typology will corre-
spondingly be more frequent in the data. For com-
puting the likelihood P(vj|sfi,x), as each vector is 
made of m components, that is, the linguistic cues 
vz = {lc1, lc2, ..., lcm}, we proceed as in (7) on the 
basis of P(lcl|sfi,x); i.e. the likelihood of finding the 
word in a particular context given a particular syn-
tactic feature.

For computing the likelihood, we count on the 
conditional probabilities of the correlations be-
tween features as defined in the typology. We use 
these correlations to infer the expectation of ob-
serving the linguistic cues associated to particular 
syntactic features, and to make it to be conditional 
to a particular feature and value. However, linguis-
tic cues and syntactic features are in two different 
dimensions; syntactic features are properties of 
lexical items, while linguistic cues show the char-
acteristics of actual occurrences. As we assume 
that each syntactic feature must have at least one 
corresponding linguistic cue, we must tune the 
probability to acknowledge the factors that affect 
linguistic cues. For such a tuning, we have consid-
ered the following two issues: (i) to include in the 
assessments the known uncertainty of the linguistic 
cues that can be present in the occurrence or not; 
and (ii) to create a dummy variable to deal with the 
fact that, while syntactic features in the typology 
are independent from one another, evidences in 
text are not so. 
We have also observed that the information that 
can be gathered by looking at all word occurrences 
as a complex unit have a conclusive value. Take 
for instance the case of prepositions. The observa-
tion of a given prepositions in different occur-
rences of the same word is a conclusive evidence 
for considering it a bound preposition.  In order to 
take this into account, we have devised a function 
that acts as a dynamic weighting module. The 
function app_lc(sfi, ?) returns the number of con-
texts where the cue is found. In the case that in a 
                                                 
10 In the theoretical case of having the same probability 
for yes and for no, Z is undefined.  
109
particular signature there is no context with such a 
lc, it returns ?1?. Thus, app_lc is used to reinforce 
this conclusive evidence in (5), which is now (9).

3.2 A Decision tree 
Linguistic motivated features have also been 
evaluated using a C4.5 Decision Tree (DT) classi-
fier (Quinlan, 1993) in the Weka implementation 
(Witten and Frank, 2005). These features corre-
spond to the expected contexts for the different 
nominal and adjectival lexical types. 
We have trained the DT with all the vectors of 
the word occurrences that we had in the different 
gold-standards, using their encoding for the super-
vised experiment in a 10-fold cross-validation test-
ing (Bel et al 2007).  
3.3 Evaluation and Results 
For the evaluation, we have applied both methods 
to the lexical acquisition of nouns and adjectives.  
We have worked with a PoS tagged corpus of 
1,091,314 words. Datasets of 496 adjectives and 
289 nouns were selected among the ones that had 
occurrences in the corpus. Some manual selection 
had to be done in order to have all possible types 
represented but still it roughly corresponds to the 
distribution of features in the existing lexicon. 
We evaluated by comparing with Gold-
standard files; i.e. the manually encoded lexicon of 
the SRG. The usual accuracy measures as type 
precision (percentage of feature values correctly 
assigned to all values assigned) and type recall 
(percentage of correct feature values found in the 
dictionary) have been used. F1 is the usual score 
combining precision and recall.  
Table 3 shows the results in terms of F1 score 
for the different methods and PoS for feature as-
signment. From these data, we concluded that the 
probabilistic information inferred from the lexical 
typology defined in our grammar is a good source 
of knowledge for lexical acquisition.

Finally, Table 5 shows the results for 50 Spanish 
nouns with only one occurrence in the corpus. 
These results show that grammatical features can 
be used for lexical acquisition of low frequency 
lexical items, providing a good hypothesis for en-
suring grammar robustness and adding no over-
generation to parsing results.

4 Future Work 
We have presented work on the development of an 
HPSG grammar for Spanish; in particular, we have 
described our approach for pre-processing and on-
going research on automatic lexical acquisition. 
Besides extending the coverage of the SRG and 
continuing research on lexical acquisition, the spe-
cific aims of our future work on the SRG are: 
? Treebank development. 
110
? To extend the shallow/deep architecture 
and integrate the structures generated by 
partial parsing, to provide robust techniques 
for infrequent structural constructions. The 
coverage of these linguistic structures by 
means of structure rules would increase both 
processing time and ambiguity.  
? To use ML methods for disambiguation; 
i.e. for ranking possible parsings according 
to relevant linguistic features, thus enabling 
the setting of a threshold to select the n-best 
analyses. 
? The development of error mining tech-
niques (van Noord, 2004) to identify errone-
ous and incomplete information in the lin-
guistic resources which cause the grammar 
to fail.
