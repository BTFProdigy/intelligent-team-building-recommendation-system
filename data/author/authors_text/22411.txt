Abstract
Microblog has become a major plat-
form for information about real-world
events. Automatically discovering real-
world events from microblog has attracted
the attention of many researchers. Howev-
er, most of existing work ignore the impor-
tance of emotion information for event de-
tection. We argue that people?s emotion-
al reactions immediately reflect the occur-
ring of real-world events and should be im-
portant for event detection. In this study,
we focus on the problem of community-
related event detection by community e-
motions. To address the problem, we pro-
pose a novel framework which include
the following three key components: mi-
croblog emotion classification, community
emotion aggregation and community emo-
tion burst detection. We evaluate our ap-
proach on real microblog data sets. Exper-
imental results demonstrate the effective-
ness of the proposed framework.
1 Introduction
Microblog has become a popular and convenient
platform for people to share information about so-
cial events in real time. When an external even-
t occurs, it will be quickly propagated between
microblog users. During propagation process of
an event, sufficient amount of users will express
their emotions. Taking Sina Weibo
1
as an exam-
ple, more than 12 percent of users use emoticons
2
when reposting an event-related microblog mes-
sage.
The emotion information can not only help us
better understand a given event, but also be u-
tilized to discover new events. Figure 1 shows
