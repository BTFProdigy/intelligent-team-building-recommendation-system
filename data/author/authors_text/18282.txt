Abstract
We present a context-sensitive chart prun-
ing method for CKY-style MT decoding.
Source phrases that are unlikely to have
aligned target constituents are identified
using sequence labellers learned from the
parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained
by pruning corresponding chart cells. The
proposed method is easy to implement, or-
thogonal to cube pruning and additive to
its pruning power. On a full-scale English-
to-German experiment with a string-to-
tree model, we obtain a speed-up of more
than 60% over a strong baseline, with no
loss in BLEU.
1 Introduction
Syntactic MT models suffer from decoding effi-
ciency bottlenecks introduced by online n-gram
language model integration and high grammar
complexity. Various efforts have been devoted to
improving decoding efficiency, including hyper-
graph rescoring (Heafield et al, 2013; Huang and
Chiang, 2007), coarse-to-fine processing (Petrov
et al, 2008; Zhang and Gildea, 2008) and gram-
mar transformations (Zhang et al, 2006). For
more expressive, linguistically-motivated syntac-
tic MT models (Galley et al, 2004; Galley et
al., 2006), the grammar complexity has grown
considerably over hierarchical phrase-based mod-
els (Chiang, 2007), and decoding still suffers from
efficiency issues (DeNero et al, 2009).
In this paper, we study a chart pruning method
for CKY-style MT decoding that is orthogonal to
cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) and additive to its
pruning power. The main intuition of our method
is to find those source phrases (i.e. any sequence
of consecutive words) that are unlikely to have any
consistently aligned target counterparts according
to the source context and grammar constraints. We
show that by using highly-efficient sequence la-
belling models learned from the bitext used for
translation model training, such phrases can be ef-
fectively identified prior to MT decoding, and cor-
responding chart cells can be excluded for decod-
ing without affecting translation quality.
We call our method context-sensitive pruning
(CSP); it can be viewed as a bilingual adap-
tation of similar methods in monolingual pars-
ing (Roark and Hollingshead, 2008; Zhang et al,
2010) which improve parsing efficiency by ?clos-
ing? chart cells using binary classifiers. Our con-
tribution is that we demonstrate such methods can
be applied to synchronous-grammar parsing by la-
belling the source-side alone. This is achieved
through a novel training scheme where the la-
belling models are trained over the word-aligned
bitext and gold-standard pruning labels are ob-
tained by projecting target-side constituents to the
source words. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to apply this technique to MT decoding.
The proposed method is easy to implement
and effective in practice. Results on a full-scale
English-to-German experiment show that it gives
more than 60% speed-up over a strong cube prun-
ing baseline, with no loss in BLEU. While we use
a string-to-tree model in this paper, the approach
can be adapted to other syntax-based models.

from an example word-aligned sentence pair.
2 The Baseline String-to-Tree Model
Our baseline translation model uses the rule ex-
traction algorithm of Chiang (2007) adapted to a
string-to-tree grammar. After extracting phrasal
pairs using the standard approach of Koehn et al
(2003), all pairs whose target phrases are not ex-
haustively dominated by a constituent of the parse
tree are removed and each remaining pair, ?f, e?,
together with its constituent label, C, forms a lex-
ical grammar rule: C ? ?f, e?. The rules r1, r2,
and r3 in Figure 1 are lexical rules. Non-lexical
rules are generated by eliminating one or more
pairs of terminal substrings from an existing rule
and substituting non-terminals. This process pro-
duces the example rules r4 and r5.
Our decoding algorithm is a variant of CKY
and is similar to other algorithms tailored for spe-
cific syntactic translation grammars (DeNero et
al., 2009; Hopkins and Langmead, 2010). By tak-
ing the source-side of each rule, projecting onto it
the non-terminal labels from the target-side, and
weighting the grammar according to the model?s
local scoring features, decoding is a straightfor-
ward extension of monolingual weighted chart
parsing. Non-local features, such as n-gram lan-
guage model scores, are incorporated through
cube pruning (Chiang, 2007).

overgeneration at the span level and render decod-
ing inefficient. Prior work on monolingual syn-
tactic parsing has demonstrated that by exclud-
ing chart cells that are likely to violate constituent
constraints, decoding efficiency can be improved
with no loss in accuracy (Roark and Hollingshead,
2008). We consider a similar mechanism for syn-
tactic MT decoding by prohibiting subtranslation
generation for chart cells violating synchronous-
grammar constraints.
A motivating example is shown in Figure 2a,
where a segment of an English-German sentence
pair from the training data, along with its word
alignment and target-side parse tree is depicted.
The English phrases ?value of? and ?the products?
do not have corresponding German translations in
this example. Although the grammar may have
rules to translate these two phrases, they can be
safely pruned for this particular sentence pair.
In contrast to chart pruning for monolingual
parsing, our pruning decisions are based on the
source context, its target translation and the map-
ping between the two. This distinction is impor-
tant since the syntactic correspondence between
different language pairs is different. Suppose that
we were to translate the same English sentence
into Japanese (Figure 2a); unlike the English to
German example, the English phrase ?the prod-
ucts? will be a valid phrase that has a Japanese
translation under a target constituent, since it is
syntactically aligned to ???? (Figure 2b).
The key question to consider is how to inject
target syntax and word alignment information into
our labelling models, so that pruning decisions can
be based on the source alone, we address this in the
following two sections.
3.2 Pruning by Labelling
We use binary tags to indicate whether a source
word can start or end a multi-word phrase that has

types of tags are assigned independently.
a consistently aligned target constituent. We call
these two types the b-tag and the e-tag, respec-
tively, and use the set of values {0, 1} for both.
Under this scheme, a b-tag value of 1 indi-
cates that a source word can be the start of a
source phrase that has a consistently aligned target
phrase; similarly an e-tag of 0 indicates that a word
cannot end a source phrase. If either the b-tag or
the e-tag of an input phrase is 0, the correspond-
ing chart cells will be pruned. The pruning effects
of the two types of tags are illustrated in Figure 3.
In general, 0-valued b-tags prune a whole column
of chart cells and 0-valued e-tags prune a whole
diagonal of cells; and the chart cells on the first
row and the top-most cell are always kept so that
complete translations can always be found.
We build a separate labeller for each tag type us-
ing gold-standard b- and e-tags, respectively. We
train the labellers with maximum-entropy models
(Curran and Clark, 2003; Ratnaparkhi, 1996), us-
ing features similar to those used for suppertag-
ging for CCG parsing (Clark and Curran, 2004).
In each case, features for a pruning tag consist
of word and POS uni-grams extracted from the 5-
word window with the current word in the middle,
POS trigrams ending with the current word, as well
as two previous tags as a bigram and two separate
uni-grams. Our pruning labellers are highly effi-
cient, run in linear time and add little overhead to
decoding. During testing, in order to prevent over-
pruning, a probability cutoff value ? is used. A tag
value of 0 is assigned to a word only if its marginal
probability is greater than ?.
3.3 Gold-standard Pruning Tags
Gold-standard tags are extracted from the word-
aligned bitext used for translation model train-
ing, respecting rule extraction constraints, which
is crucial for the success of our method.
For each training sentence pair, gold-standard
b-tags and e-tags are assigned separately to the

ment A?f?e and 1-best parse tree ? for f

source words. First, we initialize both tags of each
source word to 0s. Then, we iterate through all tar-
get constituent spans, and for each span, we find
its corresponding source phrase, as determined by
the word alignment. If a constituent exists for the
phrase pair, the b-tag of the first word and the e-tag
of the last word in the source phrase are set to 1s,
respectively. Pseudocode is shown in Algorithm 1.
Note that our definition of the gold-standard al-
lows source-side labels to integrate bilingual in-
formation. On line 6, the target-side syntax is
projected to the source; on line 9, consistency is
checked against word alignment.
Consider again the alignment in Figure 2a. Tak-
ing the target constituent span covering ?der Pro-
dukte? as an example, the source phrase under a
consistent word alignment is ?of the products?.
Thus, the b-tag of ?of? and the e-tag of ?prod-
ucts? are set to 1s. After considering all target
constituent spans, the complete b- and e-tag se-
quences for the source-side phrase in Figure 2a
are [1, 1, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 1, 1], respectively. Note
that, since we never prune single-word spans, we
ignore source phrases under consistent one-to-one
or one-to-many alignments.
From the gold standard data, we found 73.69%
of the 54M words do not begin a multi-word
aligned phrase and 77.71% do not end a multi-
word aligned phrase; the 1-best accuracies of the
two labellers tested on a held-out 20K sentences
are 82.50% and 88.78% respectively.

4 Experiments
4.1 Setup
A Moses (Koehn et al, 2007) string-to-tree sys-
tem is used as our baseline. The training cor-
pus consists of the English-German sections of
the Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and the News Com-
mentary corpus. Discarding pairs without target-
side parses, the final training data has 2M sen-
tence pairs, with 54M and 52M words on the
English and German sides, respectively. Word-
alignments are obtained by running GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2000) in both directions and refined
with ?grow-diag-final-and? (Koehn et al, 2003).
For all experiments, a 5-gram language model
with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman,
1996) built with the SRILM Toolkit (Stolcke and
others, 2002) is used.
The development and test sets are the 2008
WMT newstest (2,051 sentences) and 2009 WMT
newstest (2,525 sentences) respectively. Feature
weights are tuned with MERT (Och, 2003) on
the development set and output is evaluated us-
ing case-sensitive BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002).
For both rule extraction and decoding, up to seven
terminal/non-terminal symbols on the source-side
are allowed. For decoding, the maximum span-
length is restricted to 15, and the grammar is pre-
filtered to match the entire test set for both the
baseline system and the chart pruning decoder.
We use two labellers to perform b- and e-tag la-
belling independently prior to decoding. Training
of the labelling models is able to complete in un-
der 2.5 hours and the whole test set is labelled in
under 2 seconds. A standard perceptron POS tag-
ger (Collins, 2002) trained on Wall Street Journal
sections 2-21 of the Penn Treebank is used to as-
sign POS tags for both our training and test data.
4.2 Results
Figures 4a and 4b compare CSP with the cube
pruning baseline in terms of BLEU. Decoding
speed is measured by the average decoding time
and average number of hypotheses generated per
sentence. We first run the baseline decoder un-
der various beam settings (b = 100 - 2500) un-
til no further increase in BLEU is observed. We
then run the CSP decoder with a range of ? val-
ues (? = 0.91 ? 0.99), at the default beam size
of 1000 of the baseline decoder. The CSP de-
coder, which considers far fewer chart cells and
generates significantly fewer subtranslations, con-
sistently outperforms the slower baseline. It ulti-
mately achieves a BLEU score of 14.86 at a proba-
bility cutoff value of 0.98, slightly higher than the
highest score of the baseline.
At all levels of comparable translation quality,
our decoder is faster than the baseline. On aver-
age, the speed-up gained is 63.58% as measured
by average decoding time, and comparing on a
point-by-point basis, our decoder always runs over
60% faster. At the ? value of 0.98, it yields a
speed-up of 57.30%, compared with a beam size
of 400 for the baseline, where both achieved the
highest BLEU.
Figures 5a and 5b demonstrate the pruning
power of CSP (? = 0.95) in comparison with the
baseline (beam size = 300); across all the cutoff
values and beam sizes, the CSP decoder considers
54.92% fewer translation hypotheses on average
and the minimal reduction achieved is 46.56%.

ferent lengths pruned by CSP (? = 0.98). As ex-

Span Length

pected, longer spans are pruned more often, as
they are more likely to be at the intersections of
cells pruned by the two types of pruning labels,
thus can be pruned by either type.
We also find CSP does not improve search qual-
ity and it leads to slightly lower model scores,
which shows that some higher scored translation
hypotheses are pruned. This, however, is perfectly
desirable. Since our pruning decisions are based
on independent labellers using contextual infor-
mation, with the objective of eliminating unlikely
subtranslations and rule applications. It may even
offset defects of the translation model (i.e. high-
scored bad translations). The fact that the output
BLEU did not decrease supports this reasoning.
Finally, it is worth noting that our string-to-tree
model does not force complete target parses to be
built during decoding, which is not required in our
pruning method either. We do not use any other
heuristics (other than keeping singleton and the
top-most cells) to make complete translation al-
ways possible. The hypothesis here is that good
labelling models should not affect the derivation
of complete target translations.
5 Conclusion
We presented a novel sequence labelling based,
context-sensitive pruning method for a string-to-
tree MT model. Our method achieves more than
60% speed-up over a state-of-the-art baseline on
a full-scale translation task. In future work, we
plan to adapt our method to models with differ-
ent rule extraction algorithms, such as Hiero and
forest-based translation (Mi and Huang, 2008).

Abstract
This paper presents the first dependency
model for a shift-reduce CCG parser. Mod-
elling dependencies is desirable for a num-
ber of reasons, including handling the
?spurious? ambiguity of CCG; fitting well
with the theory of CCG; and optimizing
for structures which are evaluated at test
time. We develop a novel training tech-
nique using a dependency oracle, in which
all derivations are hidden. A challenge
arises from the fact that the oracle needs
to keep track of exponentially many gold-
standard derivations, which is solved by
integrating a packed parse forest with the
beam-search decoder. Standard CCGBank
tests show the model achieves up to 1.05
labeled F-score improvements over three
existing, competitive CCG parsing models.
1 Introduction
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steed-
man (2000)) is able to derive typed dependency
structures (Hockenmaier, 2003; Clark and Curran,
2007), providing a useful approximation to the un-
derlying predicate-argument relations of ?who did
what to whom?. To date, CCG remains the most
competitive formalism for recovering ?deep? de-
pendencies arising from many linguistic phenom-
ena such as raising, control, extraction and coordi-
nation (Rimell et al, 2009; Nivre et al, 2010).
To achieve its expressiveness, CCG exhibits
so-called ?spurious? ambiguity, permitting many
non-standard surface derivations which ease the
recovery of certain dependencies, especially those
arising from type-raising and composition. But
this raises the question of what is the most suit-
able model for CCG: should we model the deriva-
tions, the dependencies, or both? The choice for
some existing parsers (Hockenmaier, 2003; Clark
and Curran, 2007) is to model derivations directly,
restricting the gold-standard to be the normal-form
derivations (Eisner, 1996) from CCGBank (Hock-
enmaier and Steedman, 2007).
Modelling dependencies, as a proxy for the se-
mantic interpretation, fits well with the theory of
CCG, in which Steedman (2000) argues that the
derivation is merely a ?trace? of the underlying
syntactic process, and that the structure which
is built, and predicated over when applying con-
straints on grammaticality, is the semantic inter-
pretation. The early dependency model of Clark
et al (2002), in which model features were defined
over only dependency structures, was partly moti-
vated by these theoretical observations.
More generally, dependency models are desir-
able for a number of reasons. First, modelling
dependencies provides an elegant solution to the
spurious ambiguity problem (Clark and Curran,
2007). Second, obtaining training data for de-
pendencies is likely to be easier than for syn-
tactic derivations, especially for incomplete data
(Schneider et al, 2013). Clark and Curran (2006)
show how the dependency model from Clark and
Curran (2007) extends naturally to the partial-
training case, and also how to obtain dependency
data cheaply from gold-standard lexical category
sequences alone. And third, it has been argued that
dependencies are an ideal representation for parser
evaluation, especially for CCG (Briscoe and Car-
roll, 2006; Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002), and so
optimizing for dependency recovery makes sense
from an evaluation perspective.
In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by
developing the first dependency model for a shift-
reduce CCG parser. Shift-reduce parsing applies
naturally to CCG (Zhang and Clark, 2011), and the
left-to-right, incremental nature of the decoding
fits with CCG?s cognitive claims. The discrimina-
tive model is global and trained with the structured
perceptron. The decoder is based on beam-search
218
(Zhang and Clark, 2008) with the advantage of
linear-time decoding (Goldberg et al, 2013).
A main contribution of the paper is a novel tech-
nique for training the parser using a dependency
oracle, in which all derivations are hidden. A
challenge arises from the potentially exponential
number of derivations leading to a gold-standard
dependency structure, which the oracle needs to
keep track of. Our solution is an integration of
a packed parse forest, which efficiently stores all
the derivations, with the beam-search decoder at
training time. The derivations are not explicitly
part of the data, since the forest is built from the
gold-standard dependencies. We also show how
perceptron learning with beam-search (Collins and
Roark, 2004) can be extended to handle the ad-
ditional ambiguity, by adapting the ?violation-
fixing? perceptron of Huang et al (2012).
Results on the standard CCGBank tests show
that our parser achieves absolute labeled F-score
gains of up to 0.5 over the shift-reduce parser of
Zhang and Clark (2011); and up to 1.05 and 0.64
over the normal-form and hybrid models of Clark
and Curran (2007), respectively.
2 Shift-Reduce with Beam-Search
This section describes how shift-reduce tech-
niques can be applied to CCG, following Zhang
and Clark (2011). First we describe the determin-
istic process which a parser would follow when
tracing out a single, correct derivation; then we
describe how a model of normal-form derivations
? or, more accurately, a sequence of shift-reduce
actions leading to a normal-form derivation ?
can be used with beam-search to develop a non-
deterministic parser which selects the highest scor-
ing sequence of actions. Note this section only de-
scribes a normal-form derivation model for shift-
reduce parsing. Section 3 explains how we extend
the approach to dependency models.
The shift-reduce algorithm adapted to CCG is
similar to that of shift-reduce dependency parsing
(Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Mc-
Donald, 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang and
Sagae, 2010). Following Zhang and Clark (2011),
we define each item in the parser as a pair ?s, q?,
where q is a queue of remaining input, consisting
of words and a set of possible lexical categories for
each word (with q
0
being the front word), and s is
the stack that holds subtrees s
0
, s
1
, ... (with s
0
at
the top). Subtrees on the stack are partial deriva-
step stack (s
n
, ..., s
1
, s
0
) queue (q
0
, q
1
, ..., q
m
) action

tions that have been built as part of the shift-reduce
process. SHIFT, REDUCE and UNARY are the three
types of actions that can be applied to an item. A
SHIFT action shifts one of the lexical categories
of q
0
onto the stack. A REDUCE action combines
s
0
and s
1
according to a CCG combinatory rule,
producing a new category on the top of the stack.
A UNARY action applies either a type-raising or
type-changing rule to the stack-top category s
0
.
1
Figure 1 shows a deterministic example for the
sentence Mr. President visited Paris, giving a sin-
gle sequence of shift-reduce actions which pro-
duces a correct derivation (i.e. one producing the
correct set of dependencies). Starting with the ini-
tial item ?s, q?
0
(row 0), which has an empty stack
and a full queue, a total of nine actions are applied
to produce the complete derivation.
Applying beam-search to a statistical shift-
reduce parser is a straightforward extension to the
deterministic example. At each step, a beam is
used to store the top-k highest-scoring items, re-
sulting from expanding all items in the previous
beam. An item becomes a candidate output once it
has an empty queue, and the parser keeps track of
the highest scored candidate output and returns the
best one as the final output. Compared with greedy
local-search (Nivre and Scholz, 2004), the use of
a beam allows the parser to explore a larger search
space and delay difficult ambiguity-resolving de-
cisions by considering multiple items in parallel.
We refer to the shift-reduce model of Zhang and
Clark (2011) as the normal-form model, where
the oracle for each sentence specifies a unique se-
quence of gold-standard actions which produces
the corresponding normal-form derivation. No de-
pendency structures are involved at training and
test time, except for evaluation. In the next sec-
tion, we describe a dependency oracle which con-
siders all sequences of actions producing a gold-
standard dependency structure to be correct.

3 The Dependency Model
Categories in CCG are either basic (such as NP
and PP ) or complex (such as (S [dcl ]\NP)/NP ).
Each complex category in the lexicon defines one
or more predicate-argument relations, which can
be realized as a predicate-argument dependency
when the corresponding argument slot is con-
sumed. For example, the transitive verb category
above defines two relations: one for the subject
NP and one for the object NP . In this paper a
CCG predicate-argument dependency is a 4-tuple:
?h
f
, f, s, h
a
? where h
f
is the lexical item of the
lexical category expressing the relation; f is the
lexical category; s is the argument slot; and h
a
is
the head word of the argument. Since the lexical
items in a dependency are indexed by their sen-
tence positions, all dependencies for a sentence
form a set, which is referred to as a CCG depen-
dency structure. Clark and Curran (2007) contains
a detailed description of dependency structures.
Fig. 2 shows an example demonstrating spu-
rious ambiguity in relation to a CCG depen-
dency structure. In both derivations, the first
two lexical categories are combined using for-
ward application (>) and the following depen-
dency is realized: ?Mr.,N /N
1
, 1,President?. In
the normal-form derivation (a), the dependency
?visited, (S\NP
1
)/NP
2
, 2,Paris? is created by com-
bining the transitive verb category with the ob-
ject NP using forward application. One final de-
pendency, ?visited, (S\NP
1
)/NP
2
, 1,President?, is re-
alized when the root node S [dcl ] is produced
through backward application (<).
Fig. 2(b) shows a non-normal-form derivation
which uses type-raising (T) and composition (B)
(which are not required to derive the correct de-
pendency structure). In this alternative derivation,
the dependency ?visited, (S\NP
1
)/NP
2
, 1,President?
is realized using forward composition (B), and
?visited, (S\NP
1
)/NP
2
, 2,Paris? is realized when the
S [dcl ] root is produced.
The chart-based dependency model of Clark
and Curran (2007) treats all derivations as hid-
den, and defines a probabilistic model for a de-
pendency structure by summing probabilities of
all derivations leading to a particular structure.
Features are defined over both derivations and
CCG predicate-argument dependencies. We fol-
low a similar approach, but rather than define
a probabilistic model (which requires summing),
we define a linear model over sequences of shift-
reduce actions, as for the normal-form shift-reduce
model. However, the difference compared to the
normal-form model is that we do not assume a sin-
gle gold-standard sequence of actions.
Similar to Goldberg and Nivre (2012), we de-
fine an oracle which determines, for a gold-
standard dependency structure, G, what the valid
transition sequences are (i.e. those sequences cor-
responding to derivations leading to G). More
specifically, the oracle can determine, givenG and
an item ?s, q?, what the valid actions are for that
item (i.e. what actions can potentially lead to G,
starting with ?s, q? and the dependencies already
built on s). However, there can be exponentially
many valid action sequences for G, which we rep-
resent efficiently using a packed parse forest. We
show how the forest can be used, during beam-
search decoding, to determine the valid actions
for a parse item (Section 3.2). We also show, in
Section 3.3, how perceptron training with early-
update (Collins and Roark, 2004) can be used in
this setting.
3.1 The Oracle Forest
A CCG parse forest efficiently represents an
exponential number of derivations. Following
Clark and Curran (2007) (which builds on Miyao
and Tsujii (2002)), and using the same nota-
tion, we define a CCG parse forest ? as a tuple
?C,D,R, ?, ??, where C is a set of conjunctive
220
Algorithm 1 (Clark and Curran, 2007)

nodes and D is a set of disjunctive nodes.
2
Con-
junctive nodes are individual CCG categories in ?,
and are either obtained from the lexicon, or by
combining two disjunctive nodes using a CCG rule,
or by applying a unary rule to a disjunctive node.
Disjunctive nodes are equivalence classes of con-
junctive nodes. Two conjunctive nodes are equiv-
alent iff they have the same category, head and un-
filled dependencies (i.e. they will lead to the same
derivation, and produce the same dependencies, in
any future parsing). R ? D is a set of root dis-
junctive nodes. ? : D ? 2
C
is the conjunctive
child function and ? : C ? 2
D
is the disjunctive
child function. The former returns the set of all
conjunctive nodes of a disjunctive node, and the
latter returns the disjunctive child nodes of a con-
junctive node.
The dependency model requires all the conjunc-
tive and disjunctive nodes of ? that are part of the
derivations leading to a gold-standard dependency
structure G. We refer to such derivations as cor-
rect derivations and the packed forest containing
all these derivations as the oracle forest, denoted
as ?
G
, which is a subset of ?. It is prohibitive to
enumerate all correct derivations, but it is possible
to identify, from ?, all the conjunctive and dis-
junctive nodes that are part of ?
G
. Clark and Cur-
ran (2007) gives an algorithm for doing so, which
we use here. The main intuition behind the algo-
rithm is that a gold-standard dependency structure
decomposes over derivations; thus gold-standard
dependencies realized at conjunctive nodes can be
counted when ? is built, and all nodes that are part
of ?
G
can then be marked out of ? by traversing
it top-down. A key idea in understanding the algo-
2
Under the hypergraph framework (Gallo et al, 1993;
Huang and Chiang, 2005), a conjunctive node corresponds to
a hyperedge and a disjunctive node corresponds to the head
of a hyperedge or hyperedge bundle.
rithm is that dependencies are created when dis-
junctive nodes are combined, and hence are asso-
ciated with, or ?live on?, conjunctive nodes in the
forest.
Following Clark and Curran (2007), we also
define the following three values, where the first
decomposes only over local rule productions,
while the other two decompose over derivations:
cdeps(c) =
{
? if ? ? ? deps(c), ? /? G
|deps(c)| otherwise
dmax(c) =
?
??
??
? if cdeps(c) == ?
? if dmax(d) == ? for some d ? ?(c)
?
d??(c)
dmax(d) + cdeps(c) otherwise
dmax(d) = max{dmax(c) | c ? ?(d)}
deps(c) is the set of all dependencies on con-
junctive node c, and cdeps(c) counts the number
of correct dependencies on c. dmax(c) is the max-
imum number of correct dependencies over any
sub-derivation headed by c and is calculated re-
cursively; dmax(d) returns the same value for a
disjunctive node. In all cases, a special value ?
indicates the presence of incorrect dependencies.
To obtain the oracle forest, we first pre-compute
dmax(c) and dmax(d) for all d and c in ? when ?
is built using CKY, which are then used by Algo-
rithm 1 to identify all the conjunctive and disjunc-
tive nodes in ?
G
.
3.2 The Dependency Oracle Algorithm
We observe that the canonical shift-reduce algo-
rithm (as demonstrated in Fig. 1) applied to a sin-
gle parse tree exactly resembles bottom-up post-
order traversal of that tree. As an example, con-
sider the derivation in Fig. 2a, where the corre-
sponding sequence of actions is: sh N /N , sh N ,
re N , un NP , sh (S [dcl ]\NP)/NP , sh NP ,
re S [dcl ]\NP , re S [dcl ].
3
The order of traversal
is left-child, right-child and parent. For a single
parse, the corresponding shift-reduce action se-
quence is unique, and for a given item this canoni-
cal order restricts the possible derivations that can
be formed using further actions. We now extend
this observation to the more general case of an
oracle forest, where there may be more than one
gold-standard action for a given item.
Definition 1. Given a gold-standard dependency
3
The derivation is ?upside down?, following the conven-
tion used for CCG, where the root is S [dcl ]. We use sh, re
and un to denote the three types of shift-reduce action.

structure G, an oracle forest ?
G
, and an item
?s, q?, we say s is a realization of G, denoted
s ' G, if |s| = 1, q is empty and the single deriva-
tion on s is correct. If |s| > 0 and the subtrees on
s can lead to a correct derivation in ?
G
using fur-
ther actions, we say s is a partial-realization of
G, denoted as s ? G. And we define s ? G for
|s| = 0.
As an example, assume that ?
G
contains only
the derivation in Fig. 2a; then a stack containing
the two subtrees in Fig. 3a is a partial-realization,
while a stack containing the three subtrees in
Fig. 3b is not. Note that each of the three sub-
trees in Fig. 3b is present in ?
G
; however, these
subtrees cannot be combined into the single cor-
rect derivation, since the correct sequence of shift-
reduce actions must first combine the lexical cat-
egories for Mr. and President before shifting the
lexical category for visited.
We denote an action as a pair (x, c), where
x ? {SHIFT, REDUCE, UNARY} and c is the root
of the subtree resulting from that action. For all
three types of actions, c also corresponds to a
unique conjunctive node in the complete forest ?;
and we use c
s
i
to denote the conjunctive node in
? corresponding to subtree s
i
on the stack. Let
?s
?
, q
?
? = ?s, q? ? (x, c) be the resulting item from
applying the action (x, c) to ?s, q?; and let the
set of all possible actions for ?s, q? be X
?s,q?
=
{(x, c) | (x, c) is applicable to ?s, q?}.
Definition 2. Given ?
G
and an item ?s, q? s.t. s ?
G, we say an applicable action (x, c) for the item
is valid iff s
?
? G or s
?
' G, where ?s
?
, q
?
? =
?s, q? ? (x, c).
Definition 3. Given ?
G
, the dependency oracle
function f
d
is defined as:
f
d
(?s, q?, (x, c),?
G
) =
{
true if s
?
? G or s
?
' G
false otherwise
where (x, c) ? X
?s,q?
and ?s
?
, q
?
? = ?s, q? ? (x, c).
The pseudocode in Algorithm 2 implements f
d
.
It determines, for a given item, whether an appli-
cable action is valid in ?
G
.
It is trivial to determine the validity of a SHIFT
action for the initial item, ?s, q?
0
, since the SHIFT
action is valid iff its category matches the gold-
standard lexical category of the first word in
the sentence. For any subsequent SHIFT action
(SHIFT, c) to be valid, the necessary condition is
c ? c
lex
0
, where c
lex
0
denotes the gold-standard
lexical category of the front word in the queue, q
0
(line 3). However, this condition is not sufficient;
a counterexample is the case where all the gold-
standard lexical categories for the sentence in Fig-
ure 2 are shifted in succession. Hence, in general,
the conditions under which an action is valid are
more complex than the trivial case above.
First, suppose there is only one correct deriva-
tion in ?
G
. A SHIFT action (SHIFT, c
lex
0
) is valid
whenever c
s
0
(the conjunctive node in ?
G
cor-
responding to the subtree s
0
on the stack) and
c
lex
0
(the conjunctive node in ?
G
corresponding
to the next gold-standard lexical category from
the queue) are both dominated by the conjunctive
node parent p of c
s
0
in ?
G
.
4
A REDUCE action
(REDUCE, c) is valid if c matches the category of
the conjunctive node parent of c
s
0
and c
s
1
in ?
G
.
A UNARY action (UNARY, c) is valid if c matches
the conjunctive node parent of c
s
0
in ?
G
. We now
generalize the case where ?
G
contains a single
correct parse to the case of an oracle forest, where
each parent p is replaced by a set of conjunctive
nodes in ?
G
.
Definition 4. The left parent set p
L
(c) of con-
junctive node c ? ?
G
is the set of all parent con-
junctive nodes of c in ?
G
, which have the disjunc-
tive node d containing c (i.e. c ? ?(d)) as a left
child.
Definition 5. The ancestor set A(c) of conjunc-
tive node c ? ?
G
is the set of all reachable ances-
tor conjunctive nodes of c in ?
G
.
Definition 6. Given an item ?s, q?, if |s| = 1 we
say s is a frontier stack.
4
Strictly speaking, the conjunctive node parent is a parent
of the disjunctive node containing the conjunctive node c
s
0
.
We will continue to use this shorthand for parents of conjunc-
tive nodes throughout the paper.

A key to defining the dependency oracle func-
tion is the notion of a shared ancestor set. In-
tuitively, shared ancestor sets are built up through
shift actions, and contain sets of nodes which can
potentially become the results of reduce or unary
actions. A further intuition is that shared ances-
tor sets define the space of possible correct deriva-
tions, and nodes in these sets are ?ticked off? when
reduce and unary actions are applied, as a single
correct derivation is built through the shift-reduce
process (corresponding to a bottom-up post-order
traversal of the derivation). The following defi-
nition shows how the dependency oracle function
builds shared ancestor sets for each action type.

is the conjunctive node cor-
responding to the gold-standard lexical category of the
first word in the sentence ( is a dummy symbol indi-
cating the bottom of stack).
The base case for Definition 7 is when the gold-
standard lexical category of the first word in the
sentence has been shifted, which creates an empty
shared ancestor set. Furthermore, the shared an-
cestor set is always empty when the stack is a fron-
tier stack.
The dependency oracle algorithm checks the va-
lidity of applicable actions. A SHIFT action is
valid if R(c
s
?
1
, c
s
?
0
) 6= ? for the resulting stack
s
?
. A valid REDUCE action consumes s
1
and
s
0
. For the new node, its shared ancestor set is
the subset of the conjunctive nodes in R(c
s
2
, c
s
1
)
which dominate the resulting conjunctive node of
a valid REDUCE action. The UNARY case for a
frontier stack is trivial: any UNARY action ap-
plicable to s in ?
G
is valid. For a non-frontier
stack, the UNARY case is similar to REDUCE ex-
cept the resulting shared ancestor set is a subset of
R(c
s
1
, c
s
0
).
We now turn to the problem of finding the
shared ancestor sets. In practice, we do not do this
by traversing ?
G
top-down from the conjunctive
nodes in p
L
(c
s
0
) on-the-fly to find each member of
R. Instead, when we build ?
G
in bottom-up topo-
logical order, we pre-compute the set of reachable
disjunctive nodes of each conjunctive node c in
?
G
as:
D(c) = ?(c) ? (?
c
?
??(d),d??(c)
(D(c
?
)))
Each D is implemented as a hash map, which
allows us to test the membership of one potential
conjunctive node in O(1) time. For example, a
conjunctive node c ? p
L
(c
s
0
) is reachable from
c
lex
0
if there is a disjunctive node d ? D(c) s.t.
c
lex
0
? ?(d). With this implementation, the com-
plexity of checking each valid SHIFT action is then
O(|p
L
(c
s
0
)|).
3.3 Training
We use the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002)
to train a global linear model and score each ac-
tion. The normal-form model of Zhang and Clark
(2011) uses an early update mechanism (Collins
and Roark, 2004), where decoding is stopped to
update model weights whenever the single gold
action falls outside the beam. In our parser, there
can be multiple gold items in a beam. One option
would be to apply early update whenever at least

18: w? w + ?(gold[0])? ?(cand[0])
one of these gold items falls outside the beam.
However, this may not be a true violation of the
gold-standard (Huang et al, 2012). Thus, we use a
relaxed version of early update, in which all gold-
standard actions must fall outside the beam before
an update is performed. This update mechanism is
provably correct under the violation-fixing frame-
work of Huang et al (2012).
Let (y,G) be a training sentence paired with its
gold-standard dependency structure and let ?
?s,q?
be the following set for an item ?s, q?:
{?s, q? ? (x, c) | f
d
(?s, q?, (x, c),?
G
) = true}
?
?s,q?
contains all correct items at step i + 1 ob-
tained by expanding ?s, q?. Let the set of all cor-
rect items at a step i+ 1 be:
5
?
G
=
?
?s,q??B
i
?
?s,q?
Algorithm 3 shows the pseudocode for training
the dependency model with early update for one
input (y,G). The score of an item ?s, q? is calcu-
lated as w ? ?(?s, q?) with respect to the current
model w, where ?(?s, q?) is the feature vector for
the item. At step i, all items are expanded and
added onto the next beam B
i+1
, and the top-k re-
tained. Early update is applied when all gold items
first fall outside the beam, and any candidate out-
put is incorrect (line 14). Since there are poten-
tially many gold items, and one gold item is re-
quired for the perceptron update, a decision needs

In Algorithm 3 we abuse notation by using ?

to be made regarding which gold item to update
against. We choose to reward the highest scoring
gold item, in line with the violation-fixing frame-
work; and penalize the highest scoring incorrect
item, using the standard perceptron update. A fi-
nal update is performed if no more expansions are
possible but the final output is incorrect.
4 Experiments
We implement our shift-reduce parser on top of the
core C&C code base (Clark and Curran, 2007) and
evaluate it against the shift-reduce parser of Zhang
and Clark (2011) (henceforth Z&C) and the chart-
based normal-form and hybrid models of Clark
and Curran (2007). For all experiments, we use
CCGBank with the standard split: sections 2-21
for training (39,604 sentences), section 00 for de-
velopment (1,913 sentences) and section 23 (2,407
sentences) for testing.
The way that the CCG grammar is implemented
in C&C has some implications for our parser.
First, unlike Z&C, which uses a context-free cover
(Fowler and Penn, 2010) and hence is able to use
all sentences in the training data, we are only able
to use 36,036 sentences. The reason is that the
grammar in C&C does not have complete cover-
age of CCGBank, due to the fact that e.g. not
all rules in CCGBank conform to the combinatory
rules of CCG. Second, our parser uses the unifica-
tion mechanism from C&C to output dependencies
directly, and hence does not need a separate post-
processing step to convert derivations into CCG de-
pendencies, as required by Z&C.
The feature templates of our model consist of
all of those in Z&C, except the ones which re-
quire lexical heads to come from either the left or
right child, as such features are incompatible with
the head passing mechanism used by C&C. Each
Z&C template is defined over a parse item, and
captures various aspects of the stack and queue
context. For example, one template returns the
top category on the stack plus its head word, to-
gether with the first word and its POS tag on the
queue. Another template returns the second cat-
egory on the stack, together with the POS tag of
its head word. Every Z&C feature is defined as
a pair, consisting of an instantiated context tem-
plate and a parse action. In addition, we use all
the CCG predicate-argument dependency features
from Clark and Curran (2007), which contribute to
the score of a REDUCE action when dependencies

are realized. Detailed descriptions of all the tem-
plates in our model can be found in the respective
papers. We run 20 training iterations and the re-
sulting model contains 16.5M features with a non-
zero weight.
We use 10-fold cross validation for POS tagging
and supertagging the training data, and automat-
ically assigned POS tags for all experiments. A
probability cut-off value of 0.0001 for the ? pa-
rameter in the supertagger is used for both train-
ing and testing. The ? parameter determines how
many lexical categories are assigned to each word;
? = 0.0001 is a relatively small value which al-
lows in a large number of categories, compared to
the default value used in Clark and Curran (2007).
For training only, if the gold-standard lexical cat-
egory is not supplied by the supertagger for a par-
ticular word, it is added to the list of categories.
4.1 Results and Analysis
The beam size was tuned on the development set,
and a value of 128 was found to achieve a rea-
sonable balance of accuracy and speed; hence this
value was used for all experiments. Since C&C al-
ways enforces non-fragmentary output (i.e. it can
only produce spanning analyses), it fails on some
sentences in the development and test sets, and
thus we also evaluate on the reduced sets, follow-
ing Clark and Curran (2007). Our parser does not
fail on any sentences because it permits fragmen-
tary output (those cases where there is more than
one subtree left on the final stack). The results for
Z&C, and the C&C normal-form and hybrid mod-
els, are taken from Zhang and Clark (2011).
Table 1 shows the accuracies of all parsers on
the development set, in terms of labeled precision
and recall over the predicate-argument dependen-
cies in CCGBank. On both the full and reduced
sets, our parser achieves the highest F-score. In
comparison with C&C, our parser shows signif-
icant increases across all metrics, with 0.57%
and 1.06% absolute F-score improvements over
the hybrid and normal-form models, respectively.
Another major improvement over the other two
parsers is in sentence level accuracy, LSent, which
measures the number of sentences for which the
dependency structure is completely correct.
Table 1 also shows that our parser has improved
recall over Z&C at some expense of precision. To
probe this further we compare labeled precision
and recall relative to dependency length, as mea-
sured by the distance between the two words in a
dependency, grouped into bins of 5 values. Fig. 4
shows clearly that Z&C favors precision over re-
call, giving higher precision scores for almost all
dependency lengths compared to our parser. In

terms of recall (Fig. 4b), our parser outperforms
Z&C over all dependency lengths, especially for
longer dependencies (x ? 20). When compared
with C&C, the recall of the Z&C parser drops
quickly for dependency lengths over 10. While
our parser also suffers from this problem, it is
less severe and is able to achieve higher recall at
x ? 30.
Table 2 compares our parser with Z&C and the
C&C hybrid model, for the most frequent depen-
dency relations. While our parser achieved lower
precision than Z&C, it is more balanced and gives
higher recall for all of the dependency relations ex-
cept the last one, and higher F-score for over half
of them.
Table 3 presents the final test results on Section
23. Again, our parser achieves the highest scores
across all metrics (for both the full and reduced
test sets), except for precision and lexical category
assignment, where Z&C performed better.
5 Conclusion
We have presented a dependency model for a shift-
reduce CCG parser, which fully aligns CCG parsing
with the left-to-right, incremental nature of a shift-
reduce parser. Our work is in part inspired by the
dependency models of Clark and Curran (2007)
and, in the use of a dependency oracle, is close
in spirit to that of Goldberg and Nivre (2012). The
difference is that the Goldberg and Nivre parser
builds, and scores, dependency structures directly,
whereas our parser uses a unification mechanism
to create dependencies, and scores the CCG deriva-
tions, allowing great flexibility in terms of what
dependencies can be realized. Another related
work is Yu et al (2013), which introduced a sim-
ilar technique to deal with spurious ambiguity in
MT. Finally, there may be potential to integrate the
techniques of Auli and Lopez (2011), which cur-
rently represents the state-of-the-art in CCGBank
parsing, into our parser.
