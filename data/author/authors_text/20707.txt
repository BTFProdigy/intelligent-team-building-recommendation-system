Abstract
Temporal information is important for
many NLP tasks, and there has been ex-
tensive research on temporal tagging with
a particular focus on English texts. Re-
cently, other languages have also been ad-
dressed, e.g., HeidelTime was extended to
process eight languages. Chinese temporal
tagging has achieved less attention, and no
Chinese temporal tagger is publicly avail-
able. In this paper, we address the full task
of Chinese temporal tagging (extraction
and normalization) by developing Chinese
HeidelTime resources. Our evaluation on
a publicly available corpus ? which we
also partially re-annotated due to its rather
low quality ? demonstrates the effective-
ness of our approach, and we outperform
a recent approach to normalize temporal
expressions. The Chinese HeidelTime re-
source as well as the corrected corpus are
made publicly available.
1 Introduction
Temporal information plays a crucial role in many
documents, and temporal tagging, i.e., the extrac-
tion of temporal expressions and their normaliza-
tion to some standard format, is crucial for sev-
eral NLP tasks. So far, research on temporal in-
formation extraction mostly focused on western
languages, especially English. In contrast, eastern
languages, e.g., Chinese, are less explored. Nev-
ertheless, there is research on Chinese temporal
tagging. While some works addressed either the
extraction or the normalization subtask, a few full
temporal taggers exist, e.g., CTEMP (Wu et al.,
2005b) and CTAT (Jing et al., 2008), but none of
them is publicly available.
In contrast, some temporal taggers were re-
cently made available, e.g., DANTE (Mazur and
Dale, 2009), TipSem (Llorens et al., 2010), and
HeidelTime (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013). Further-
more, Str?otgen et al. (2013) showed that Hei-
delTime can be extended to further languages
by developing language-specific resources with-
out modifying the source code. Thus, when de-
veloping temporal tagging capabilities for an ad-
ditional language, one is faced with the question
of whether to develop a new temporal tagger or
to extend an existing one. We decided to extend
HeidelTime for Chinese for the following reasons:
(i) HeidelTime was the best temporal tagger in
the TempEval-2 (English) and TempEval-3 (En-
glish and Spanish) competitions (Verhagen et al.,
2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), (ii) it already sup-
ports eight languages, and (iii) it is the only multi-
lingual temporal tagger for cross-domain temporal
tagging, e.g., news- and narrative-style documents
can be processed with high quality.
2 Related Work
For Chinese temporal tagging, machine learning
and rule-based approaches have been employed.
Wu et al. (2005a) and Wu (2010) report that ma-
chine learning techniques do not achieve as good
results as rule-based approaches when processing
Chinese. Thus, it is reasonable to extend a rule-
based system such as HeidelTime to Chinese.
In general, temporal tagging approaches per-
form the extraction, the normalization, or both,
and create TIDES TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) or
TimeML?s TIMEX3 (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) an-
notations. For development and evaluation, there
are two Chinese temporally annotated corpora,
the ACE 2005 training corpus and TempEval-2
(c.f. Section 3). Table 1 lists approaches to Chi-
nese temporal tagging with some further infor-
mation. The most recent work is the learning-
based language-independent discriminative pars-
ing approach for normalizing temporal expres-
sions by Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).

There are also (semi-)automatic approaches to
port a temporal tagger from one language to an-
other. For instance, TERSEO (Negri et al., 2006;
Saquete et al., 2006) has been extended from
Spanish to English and Italian by automatic rule-
translation and automatically developed parallel
corpora. However, the normalization quality of
this approach was rather low compared to a rule-
based tagger manually developed for the specific
language (Negri, 2007). This finding encour-
aged us to manually create Chinese HeidelTime
resources instead of trying automatic methods.
3 The TempEval-2 Chinese Corpus
There are two Chinese temporally annotated cor-
pora available: While the Chinese part of the ACE
2005 multilingual training corpus (Walker et al.,
2006) has been used by some approaches (c.f. Ta-
ble 1), it only contains TIMEX2 extent annota-
tions. In contrast, the TempEval-2 Chinese data
sets (Verhagen et al., 2010) contain TIMEX3 an-
notations with extent and normalization informa-
tion. However, no TempEval-2 participants ad-
dressed Chinese and only Angeli and Uszkoreit
(2013) report evaluation results on this corpus.
Since HeidelTime is TIMEX3-compliant, and we
address the extraction and normalization subtasks,
we use the TempEval-2 corpus in our work.
3.1 Annotation Standard TimeML
For temporal expressions, TimeML (Pustejovsky
et al., 2005) contains TIMEX3 tags with several
attributes. The two most important ones ? also
annotated in the TempEval-2 data ? are type and
value. Type specifies if an expression is a date,
time, duration, or set (set of times), and value con-
tains the normalized meaning in standard format.
3.2 Original TempEval-2 Corpus
The Chinese training and test sets consist of 44 and
15 documents with 746 and 190 temporal expres-
sions, respectively. However, several expressions
have no normalized value information (85 in the
training and 47 in the test set), others no type.
1
This issue was also reported by Angeli and
Uszkoreit (2013). Thus, they report evaluation re-
sults on two versions of the data sets, the original
version and a cleaned version, in which all expres-
sions without value information were removed.
3.3 Re-annotation of the TempEval-2 Corpus
Due to the significant amount of temporal expres-
sions with undefined value attributes, we decided
to manually assign normalized values to these ex-
pressions instead of excluding them. During this
process, we recognized that the corpus contained
several more errors, e.g., some expressions were
annotated as dates although they refer to durations.
Thus, instead of only substituting undefined val-
ues, we checked all annotations in the two data
sets and corrected errors. For this, one Chinese na-
tive and two further TimeML experts discussed all
modified annotations. Although there were sev-
eral difficult expressions and not all normaliza-
tions were straightforward, we significantly im-
proved the annotation quality. After our modifi-
cation, the improved training and test sets contain
765 and 193 temporal expressions with value in-
formation, respectively. In Table 2, statistics about
the three versions of the data sets are provided.
4 Chinese HeidelTime Resources
HeidelTime is a cross-domain, multilingual tem-
poral tagger that strictly separates the source
code and language-dependent resources (Str?otgen
and Gertz, 2013). While the implementation
takes care of domain-dependent normalization is-
sues, language-dependent resources contain pat-
tern, normalization, and rule files. We had to de-
velop such Chinese resources to perform Chinese
temporal tagging with HeidelTime.
1
Note that the TempEval-2 corpus developers stated that
the annotations of the non-English documents are rather ex-
perimental (Verhagen, 2011).

nese TempEval-2 data sets.
4.1 Chinese Linguistic Preprocessing
As input, HeidelTime requires sentence, token,
and part-of-speech information. For most of the
supported languages, HeidelTime uses a UIMA
wrapper of the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). Since
there is also a Chinese model for the TreeTagger
available, we rely on the TreeTagger for Chinese
linguistic preprocessing.
2
4.2 Resource Development Process
To develop Chinese HeidelTime resources, we
followed the strategy applied by Str?otgen et al.
(2013) for Spanish: Using HeidelTime?s English
resources as starting point, we translated the pat-
tern files, the normalization files, and the rules for
extracting and normalizing temporal expressions.
More details on these steps are provided next.
Pattern & Normalization Resources. English
patterns in the pattern files, which also exist in
Chinese in a similar form, were directly trans-
lated. For instance, there are Chinese expressions
for names of months and weekdays. Patterns ex-
isting in English but not used in Chinese were re-
moved, e.g., there are no abbreviations of month
names in Chinese. In contrast, for other patterns
frequently used in Chinese, additional pattern files
were created. Examples are Chinese numerals.
Based on the pattern files, we built the normal-
ization files. Here, the normalized values of the
patterns are stored. An example of the Chinese
resources is as follows: The three patterns ??
???, ?????, and ???? can all be trans-
lated as Tuesday and are thus part of the Weekday
pattern resource. Since weekdays are internally
handled by HeidelTime with their English names,
the normalization file for Chinese weekdays con-
tains ????,Tuesday? ????,Tuesday? and
???,Tuesday?.
2
http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/tools/zh/.
Chinese Rule Development. HeidelTime?s
rules contain three components, a name, an ex-
traction and a normalization part. The extraction
mainly makes use of regular expressions and the
pattern resources, and in the normalization part,
the matched expressions are normalized using the
normalization resources.
3
To develop the rules,
we again followed Str?otgen et al. (2013) and
applied the following strategy:
(i) A few simple Chinese rules were created
based on the English rules. (ii) We reviewed ex-
tracted temporal expressions in the training set and
improved the extraction and normalization parts of
the rules. (iii) We checked the training texts for
undetected expressions and created rules to match
them. In parallel, we adapted the Chinese pattern
and normalization resources when necessary. (iv)
We translated more complex English rules to also
cover valid expressions not occurring in the Chi-
nese training documents. (v) Steps (ii) to (iv) were
iteratively performed until the results on the train-
ing set could not be improved further.
4.3 Chinese Challenges
Chinese is an isolating language without inflection
and depends on word order and function words
to represent grammatical relations. Although we
only consider modern Mandarin as it is the most
widely used variety of Chinese in contemporary
texts, many challenges occurred during the re-
source development process. Some examples are:
Polysemous words: Many Chinese words have
more than one meaning, e.g., dynasty names such
as ??? (Tang) or ??? (Song) can refer to a certain
time period, but also appear as family names.
Further ambiguities: There are many ambigu-
ous expressions in Chinese, e.g., the temporal ex-
pression ????? has two meanings: ?before the
5th day of a certain month? and also ?5 days ago?
? depending on the context.
Calendars: There are various calendars in Chi-
nese culture and thus also in Chinese texts, such
as the lunar calendar and the 24 solar terms, which
are different from the Gregorian calendar and thus
very difficult to normalize. Besides, Taiwan has
a different calendar, which numbers the year from
the founding year of the Republic of China (1911).

and rule syntax, we refer to Str?otgen and Gertz (2013).

5 Evaluation
In this section, we present evaluation results of our
newly developed Chinese HeidelTime resources.
In addition, we compare our results for the normal-
ization sub-task to Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).
5.1 Evaluation Setup
Corpus: We use three versions of the TempEval-
2 training and test sets: (i) the original versions,
(ii) the improved versions described in Section 3.3,
and (iii) the cleaned versions also used by Angeli
and Uszkoreit (2013) in which temporal expres-
sions without value information are removed.
Setting: Since the TempEval-2 data already con-
tains sentence and token information, we only
had to perform part-of-speech tagging as linguistic
preprocessing step. For this, we used the TreeTag-
ger (Schmid, 1994) with its Chinese model.
Measures: We use the official TempEval-2 eval-
uation script. For the extraction, precision, recall,
and f-score are calculated on the token-level. For
the normalization, accuracy for the attributes type
and value are calculated on the expression-level.
Note that the use of accuracy makes it difficult to
compare systems having a different recall in the
extraction, as will be explained below.
5.2 Evaluation Results
Table 3 (top) shows the evaluation results on the
training set. Extraction and normalization quality
are high, and value accuracies of over 90% on the
cleaned and improved versions are promising.
4
The results on the test sets (Table 3, bottom) are
lower than on the training sets. However, value ac-
curacies of almost 90% with a recall of more than
80% are valuable and comparable to state-of-the-
art systems in other languages. A first error anal-
ysis revealed that while the training documents

Note that the lower value accuracy on the original set
is due to expressions without value information in the gold
standard, and that the low extraction precision in the clean
version is due to some of those expressions being (correctly)
extracted by the system but removed from the gold standard.

are written in modern Mandarin, some test doc-
uments contain Taiwan-specific expressions (c.f.
Section 4.3) not covered by our rules yet.
Finally, we compare the normalization quality
of our approach to the multilingual parsing ap-
proach of Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013). How-
ever, their approach performs only the normaliza-
tion subtask assuming that the extents of temporal
expressions are provided. For this, they used gold
extents for evaluation. HeidelTime only normal-
izes those expressions that it knows how to extract.
Thus, we run HeidelTime performing the extrac-
tion and the normalization. However, since the
accuracy measure used by the TempEval-2 script
calculates the ratio of correctly normalized expres-
sions to all extracted expressions and not to all
expressions in the gold standard, we additionally
present the raw numbers of correctly normalized
expressions for the two systems. Table 4 shows the
comparison between our approach and the one by
Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013). We outperform their
approach not only with respect to the accuracy but
also with respect to the numbers of correctly nor-
malized expressions (574 vs. 484
5
and 121 vs. 86
5
on the training and test sets, respectively) ? despite
the fact that we perform the full task of temporal
tagging and not only the normalization.
6 Conclusions & Ongoing Work
In this paper, we addressed Chinese temporal
tagging by developing Chinese HeidelTime re-
sources. These make HeidelTime the first publicly
available Chinese temporal tagger. Our evaluation
showed the high quality of the new HeidelTime re-
sources, and we outperform a recent normalization
approach. Furthermore, the re-annotated Chinese
TempEval-2 data sets will also be made available.
Currently, we are performing a detailed error
analysis and hope to gain insights to further im-
prove HeidelTime?s Chinese resources.

Abstract
In this paper, we describe our participation in
the TempEval-3 challenge. With our multi-
lingual temporal tagger HeidelTime, we ad-
dressed task A, the extraction and normaliza-
tion of temporal expressions for English and
Spanish. Exploiting HeidelTime?s strict sep-
aration between source code and language-
dependent parts, we tuned HeidelTime?s ex-
isting English resources and developed new
Spanish resources. For both languages, we
achieved the best results among all partici-
pants for task A, the combination of extraction
and normalization. Both the improved English
and the new Spanish resources are publicly
available with HeidelTime.
1 Introduction
The task of temporal annotation, which is addressed
in the TempEval-3 challenge, consists of three sub-
tasks: (A) the extraction and normalization of tem-
poral expressions, (B) event extraction, and (C) the
annotation of temporal relations (UzZaman et al,
2012). This makes sub-task A, i.e., temporal tag-
ging, a prerequisite for the full task of temporal an-
notating documents. In addition, temporal tagging
is important for many further natural language pro-
cessing and understanding tasks, and can also be ex-
ploited for search and exploration scenarios in infor-
mation retrieval (Alonso et al, 2011).
In the context of the TempEval-2 challenge (Ver-
hagen et al, 2010), we developed our temporal tag-
ger HeidelTime (Stro?tgen and Gertz, 2010), which
achieved the best results for the extraction and nor-
malization of temporal expressions for English doc-
uments. For our work on multilingual information
retrieval (e.g., Stro?tgen et al (2011)), we extended
HeidelTime with a focus on supporting the simple
integration of further languages (Stro?tgen and Gertz,
2012a). For TempEval-3, we now tuned Heidel-
Time?s English resources and developed new Span-
ish resources to address both languages that are part
of TempEval-3. As the evaluation results demon-
strate, HeidelTime outperforms the systems of all
other participants for the full task of temporal tag-
ging by achieving high quality results for the extrac-
tion and normalization for English and Spanish.
The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: We explain HeidelTime?s system architecture
in Section 2. Section 3 covers the tuning of Heidel-
Time?s English and the development of the Spanish
resources. Finally, we discuss the evaluation results
in Section 4, and conclude the paper in Section 5.
2 HeidelTime
HeidelTime is a multilingual, cross-domain tempo-
ral tagger. So far, it can process English, Ger-
man, and Dutch text. In previous work, we an-
alyzed domain-dependent challenges and demon-
strated that domain-sensitive strategies for normal-
izing temporal expressions result in significant nor-
malization improvements when switching between
news- and narrative-style documents (Stro?tgen and
Gertz, 2012b). Although TempEval-3 only ad-
dresses news documents, the tuned English and new
Spanish resources can be used to process news and
also narrative-style documents such as Wikipedia ar-
ticles with high extraction and normalization quality.
15
Architecture of HeidelTime. HeidelTime is a
rule-based system with a strict separation between
source code and language-dependent resources.
While the strategies for processing different do-
mains are part of the source code, resources con-
sist of files for (i) patterns, (ii) normalizations, and
(iii) rules. They are read by HeidelTime?s resource
interpreter and thus have to be developed based on
HeidelTime?s well-defined rule syntax.
The pattern files contain words and phrases,
which are typically used to express temporal ex-
pressions, e.g., names of months. The normaliza-
tion files contain normalization information about
the patterns, e.g., the value of a specific month?s
name. Finally, the rule files contain rules for date,
time, duration, and set expressions.
All rules have an extraction part and a normal-
ization part. The extraction part, in which the pat-
tern resources can be used for generalization, de-
fines the expressions that have to be matched in a
document. The normalization part normalizes the
context-independent content of the expression using
the normalization resources. While explicit tempo-
ral expressions (e.g., May 1st, 2013) can directly
be fully normalized, underspecified (November) and
relative (today, two weeks ago) expressions can only
be normalized in an underspecified manner. The full
normalization depends on the domain of the docu-
ment that is to be processed and the context of the
expression. For this, HeidelTime applies domain-
sensitive strategies to normalize such expressions
during its disambiguation phase, which is called af-
ter the extraction and the normalization phases.
The TempEval-3 data is from the news domain.
Here, HeidelTime usually uses the document cre-
ation time as reference time. The temporal relation
to it is identified based on the tense in the sentence.1
Preprocessing. HeidelTime requires sentence, to-
ken, and part-of-speech information. For this, the
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) is used. Since there is
a Spanish model for the TreeTagger, adding Spanish
preprocessing capabilities to HeidelTime was fairly
easy. A wrapper for the TreeTagger is also part of
the UIMA HeidelTime kit described next.

dependent normalization strategies, and its architecture in gen-
eral, we refer to Stro?tgen and Gertz (2012a).
UIMA HeidelTime kit. For processing Temp-
Eval-3 data, we used the UIMA version of Heidel-
Time, developed a collection reader and a CAS con-
sumer to read and write TempEval-3 input and out-
put data, and added both components to our UIMA
HeidelTime kit. This makes HeidelTime?s evalua-
tion results reproducible on the training and test sets.
3 HeidelTime for TempEval-3
In TempEval-3, we participated with one Spanish
and three English runs: For Spanish, we used our
newly developed resources. For English, we used
(i) HeidelTime 1.2, which was released in May
2012, (ii) a version containing several bug fixes and
improvements, which were implemented indepen-
dently from TempEval-3, and (iii) HeidelTime with
its new English resources tuned for TempEval-3.
In general, our goal when developing HeidelTime
resources is to achieve high quality normalization re-
sults. Thus, we only want to extract temporal ex-
pressions which can be normalized correctly with
high probability ? an issue, which will be further
looked at in the discussion in the evaluation section.
Before that, we next describe language-independent
adaptations to HeidelTime. Then, we present the
tuning of the English resources (Section 3.2) and the
development of the Spanish resources (Section 3.3).
3.1 General HeidelTime Adaptations
We performed the following language-independent
changes to HeidelTime:
(i) Weekday normalization: In news-style doc-
uments, extracted weekdays that are equal to the
weekday of the document creation time (dct) are
now normalized to the date of the dct independent
of the tense in the sentence.
(ii) Century/decade normalization: So far, decade
and century expressions were not correctly normal-
ized by HeidelTime according to TimeML, e.g.,
?199X? instead of ?199? for ?the 1990s?.
The first change is based on the intuitive assump-
tion that information in news-style documents is
temporally focused around the dct. In addition,
this assumption is supported by the English and the
Spanish training data. The second change is related
to the annotation standard. Both changes can thus
be generalized in a language-independent manner.
16
3.2 Tuning HeidelTime?s English Resources
Three training corpora were provided by the orga-
nizers: the Aquaint and TimeBank gold standard
corpora, and a large corpus referred to as silver stan-
dard, which was created by merging results of three
tools (Llorens et al, 2012). After a brief analysis,
we decided not to use the silver standard due to the
rather low annotation quality. Motivated by observa-
tions in the gold standard corpora, we performed the
following English-specific modifications in addition
to the general adaptations described above:
(i) REF-value expressions: expressions normal-
ized to past, present, or future are not consistently
annotated in the training data. Since such expres-
sions are rather less valuable for further tasks and
to avoid false positives, we removed some of those
patterns from the resources.
(ii) Ambiguous expressions: We added negative
rules for expressions such as may, march, and fall to
filter them out if they do not refer to a date.
(iii) Article/modifier: We allowed some more
combinations of articles and modifiers.
Note that HeidelTime was already a state-of-the-
art tool for English temporal tagging so that the
changes are rather minor.
3.3 Developing Spanish Resources
In this section, we explain the resource develop-
ment process for Spanish. Then, we detail language-
specific challenges we faced during this process.
Resource Development Process. So far, there
were no HeidelTime resources for Spanish, and we
thus started the development from scratch.
(i) Preprocessing: As mentioned in Section 2, we
use the TreeTagger with its Spanish module for sen-
tence, token, and part-of-speech annotation.
(ii) Translation of pattern files: Starting with Hei-
delTime?s English pattern resources, we developed
the Spanish pattern resources. The goal was that all
patterns that are frequently used to express tempo-
ral expressions are included in the resources. Note
that it is not important that the patterns are context
independent. The context in which a pattern should
occur can be defined within the rules.
(iii) Translation of normalization files: Similar to
the patterns, we translated the English normalization
files and adapted them to the new Spanish patterns.
(iv) Rule Development: Based on the English
rules for dates, times, durations, and sets, we de-
veloped similar Spanish rules. Using the Spanish
training corpus to check for partially matching pat-
terns, false positives, false negatives, and incorrect
normalizations, we then iteratively adapted the rules,
but also the pattern and normalization resources.
Challenges. Spanish as a Romance language is
rich in inflection. Nouns, adjectives, and determin-
ers are inflected with respect to number and gender.
During the development of the pattern and normal-
ization resources, this had to be taken into account.
As for nouns, there are many inflection forms of
verbs in Spanish, e.g., to represent tense. While
verbs are usually not part of temporal expressions,
the inflection of verbs has to be considered for the
normalization of ambiguous expressions such as el
lunes (Monday) or junio (June). As mentioned
above, in news-style documents, HeidelTime uses
the tense of the sentence to determine the relation
to the reference time, i.e., to decide whether the ex-
pression refers to a previous or upcoming date.
The tense is determined using part-of-speech in-
formation, and, if necessary, pattern information of
words with specific part-of-speech tags. For each
language, this information is defined in the pattern
resources. Unfortunately, the Spanish tag-set of the
TreeTagger module does not contain tags covering
tense information, e.g., all finite lexical verbs are
tagged as VLfin. Thus, we created regular expres-
sion patterns to match typical inflection patterns rep-
resenting tense information and check words tagged
as verbs by the tagger for these patterns.
However, due to the ambiguity of the Spanish in-
flection, we can only add patterns to detect future
tense. If no tense is identified, the year is set to the
year of the reference time. As detailed in the discus-
sion of the evaluation results described in Section 4,
identifying the correct relation to the reference time
is a frequent source of normalization errors.
4 Evaluation Results
Measures. For the extraction task, precision (P),
recall (R), and f1-score (F1) are used for strict and
relaxed matching. The value F1 and type F1 mea-
sures combine relaxed matching with correct nor-
malization. Systems are ranked by value F1 (value).

Results on Training Data. Table 1 shows the re-
sults on the Aquaint (a), TimeBank (b), and Spanish
training corpora (c). On both English corpora, Hei-
delTime?s TempEval-3 tuned version outperforms
the other two versions. The big differences between
the two English corpora are rather due to the better
annotation quality of TimeBank than due to different
challenges in the documents of the two corpora.
TempEval-3 Evaluation. The evaluation results
on the test data are presented in Table 2. For English,
HeidelTime?s TempEval-3 tuned version achieves
the best results, and all three HeidelTime versions
outperform the systems of the eight other partici-
pating teams with a total number of 21 submissions
(task A ranking measure value F1). For comparison,
the results of the next best system (NavyTime) is
listed in Table 2(a). For Spanish, we highly outper-
form the other two systems, as shown in Table 2(b).
Discussion. In order to be able to interpret Hei-
delTime?s results on the training and test data, we
performed an error analysis (TimeBank and Spanish
training corpus). The most important findings are:
(i) For a rule-based system, HeidelTime?s recall
is relatively low (many false negatives; FN). How-
ever, note that several FN are intentional. 55% and
29% of 117 and 149 FN in the English and Span-
ish training corpora are due to imprecise expressions
(some time; the latest period). These are difficult
to normalize correctly, e.g., some time can refer to
seconds or years. To guarantee high quality normal-
ization, we do not extract expressions that cannot be
normalized correctly with high probability.
(ii) There is a trade-off between precision and re-
call due to expressions referring to past, present, or
future (X REF). These are annotated either only in
some contexts or inconsistently throughout the train-
strict match relaxed match normalization

ing data, and thus result in FN (21%/en; 34%/es) and
false positives (43% of 98 FP in English training and
43%/es of 35 FP in Spanish training corpora).
(iii) The main sources for incorrect value normal-
ization of underspecified expressions (Feb. 1; Mon-
day) are wrongly detected reference times or rela-
tions to them (e.g., due to wrong tense identifica-
tion), annotation errors in the corpora (e.g., last week
annotated as WXX instead of the week it is referring
to), granularity errors (e.g., a year ago can refer to a
day, month, quarter, or year), and ambiguities (e.g.,
the year can be a duration or a specific year).
(iv) Some expressions in the Spanish test set were
extracted and normalized correctly although no sim-
ilar expressions exist in the Spanish training data.
Here, the Spanish resources highly benefited from
the high quality English resources as starting point
of the development process, and from HeidelTime?s
language-independent normalization strategies.
(v) A reoccurring error in the English test set
is that HeidelTime matches and normalizes expres-
sions such as two days earlier while only two days
should be annotated according to TimeML. This re-
sults in a relaxed match with false type and value.
5 Conclusions & Ongoing Work
In this paper, we presented HeidelTime?s results in
the TempEval-3 temporal tagging task. For both lan-
guages, English and Spanish, we achieved the best
results of all participants (value F1). We showed that
adding a new language to HeidelTime can result in
high quality temporal tagging of the new language.
Currently, we are working on improving the Span-
ish tense detection to better normalize underspec-
ified temporal expressions. Furthermore, we will
make available HeidelTime resources for Arabic,
Italian, and Vietnamese (HeidelTime, 2013).
