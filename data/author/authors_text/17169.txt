Abstract 
Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in 
sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical 
models have been used for the task. However, 
such models without any domain knowledge 
often produce aspects that are not interpreta-
ble in applications. To tackle the issue, some 
knowledge-based topic models have been 
proposed, which allow the user to input some 
prior domain knowledge to generate coherent 
aspects. However, existing knowledge-based 
topic models have several major shortcom-
ings, e.g., little work has been done to incor-
porate the cannot-link type of knowledge or 
to automatically adjust the number of topics 
based on domain knowledge. This paper pro-
poses a more advanced topic model, called 
MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to ad-
dress these problems, which is based on an 
Extended generalized P?lya urn (E-GPU) 
model (which is also proposed in this paper).  
Experiments on real-life product reviews 
from a variety of domains show that MC-
LDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art 
models markedly. 
1 Introduction 
In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, aspect 
extraction aims to extract entity aspects or features 
on which opinions have been expressed (Hu and 
Liu, 2004; Liu, 2012). For example, in a sentence 
?The picture looks great,? the aspect is ?picture.? 
Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1) 
extracting all aspect terms (e.g., ?picture?) from 
the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with 
similar meanings (e.g., cluster ?picture? and ?pho-
to? into one aspect category as they mean the 
same in the domain ?Camera?). In this work, we 
adopt the topic modeling approach as it can per-
form both sub-tasks simultaneously (see ? 2). 
Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al, 2003), 
provide an unsupervised framework for extracting 
latent topics in text documents. Topics are aspect 
categories (or simply aspects) in our context. 
However, in recent years, researchers have found 
that fully unsupervised topic models may not pro-
duce topics that are very coherent for a particular 
application. This is because the objective functions 
of topic models do not always correlate well with 
human judgments and needs (Chang et al, 2009). 
To address the issue, several knowledge-based 
topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA 
model (Andrzejewski et al, 2009) incorporates 
two forms of prior knowledge, also called two 
types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. 
A must-link states that two words (or terms) 
should belong to the same topic whereas a cannot-
link indicates that two words should not be in the 
same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al, 2011), more 
general knowledge can be specified using first-
order logic. In (Burns et al, 2012; Jagarlamudi et 
al., 2012; Lu et al, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 
2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable 
the user to specify prior knowledge as seed 
words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al (2010) 
also used word similarity as priors for guidance.  
However, none of the existing models is capable 
of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge 
except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al, 2009). Fur-
thermore, none of the existing models, including 
DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the num-
ber of topics based on domain knowledge. The 
domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may 
change the number of topics. There are two types 
of cannot-links: consistent and inconsistent with 
the domain corpus. For example, in the reviews of 
1655
domain ?Computer?, a topic model may generate 
two topics Battery and Screen that represent two 
different aspects. A cannot-link {battery, screen} 
as the domain knowledge is thus consistent with 
the corpus. However, words Amazon and Price 
may appear in the same topic due to their high co-
occurrences in the Amazon.com review corpus. To 
separate them, a cannot-link {amazon, price} can 
be added as the domain knowledge, which is in-
consistent with the corpus as these two words have 
high co-occurrences in the corpus. In this case, the 
number of topics needs to be increased by 1 since 
the mixed topic has to be separated into two indi-
vidual topics Amazon and Price. Apart from the 
above shortcoming, earlier knowledge-based topic 
models also have some major shortcomings: 
Incapability of handling multiple senses: A 
word typically has multiple meanings or senses. 
For example, light can mean ?of little weight? or 
?something that makes things visible.? DF-LDA 
cannot handle multiple senses because its defini-
tion of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B 
form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it 
implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A, 
B, and C should be in the same topic. This case 
also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al, 
2011), (Petterson et al, 2010), and (Mukherjee and 
Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et 
al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that 
each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed 
set), which is restrictive as the amount of 
knowledge should not be limited. 
Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge: 
When using must-links or seeds, existing models 
basically try to ensure that the words in a must-
link or a seed set have similar probabilities under a 
topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link com-
prises of a frequent word and an infrequent word, 
due to the redistribution of probability mass, the 
probability of the frequent word will decrease 
while the probability of the infrequent word will 
increase. This can harm the final topics because 
the attenuation of the frequent (often domain im-
portant) words can result in some irrelevant words 
being ranked higher (with higher probabilities). 
To address the above shortcomings, we define 
m-set (for must-set) as a set of words that should 
belong to the same topic and c-set (cannot-set) as a 
set of words that should not be in the same topic. 
They are similar to must-link and cannot-link but 
m-sets do not enforce transitivity. Transitivity is 
the main cause of the inability to handle multiple 
senses. Our m-sets and c-sets are also more con-
cise providing knowledge in the context of a set. 
As in (Andrzejewski et al, 2009), we assume that 
there is no conflict between m-sets and c-sets, i.e., 
if ?1  is a cannot-word of ?2  (i.e., shares a c-set 
with ?2), any word that shares an m-set with ?1 is 
also a cannot-word of ?2. Note that knowledge as 
m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al, 2013a) 
and (Chen et al, 2013b). 
We then propose a new topic model, called MC-
LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not on-
ly able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust 
the number of topics, but also deal with the multi-
ple senses and adverse effect of knowledge prob-
lems at the same time. For the issue of multiple 
senses, a new latent variable ? is added to LDA to 
distinguish multiple senses (? 3). Then, we employ 
the generalized P?lya urn (GPU) model 
(Mahmoud, 2008) to address the issue of adverse 
effect of knowledge (? 4). Deviating from the 
standard topic modeling approaches, we propose 
the Extended generalized P?lya urn (E-GPU) 
model (? 5). E-GPU extends the GPU model to 
enable multi-urn interactions. This is necessary for 
handling c-sets and for adjusting the number of 
topics. E-GPU is the heart of MC-LDA. Due to the 
extension, a new inference mechanism is designed 
for MC-LDA (? 6). Note that E-GPU is generic 
and can be used in any appropriate application. 
In summary, this paper makes the following 
three contributions: 
1. It proposed a new knowledge-based topic mod-
el called MC-LDA, which is able to use both 
m-sets and c-sets, as well as automatically ad-
just the number of topics based on domain 
knowledge. At the same time, it can deal with 
some other major shortcomings of early exist-
ing models. To our knowledge, none of the ex-
isting knowledge-based models is as compre-
hensive as MC-LDA in terms of capabilities. 
2. It proposed the E-GPU model to enable multi-
urn interactions, which enables c-sets to be nat-
urally integrated into a topic model. To the best 
of our knowledge, E-GPU has not been pro-
posed and used before.  
3. A comprehensive evaluation has been conduct-
ed to compare MC-LDA with several state-of-
the-art models. Experimental results based on 
both qualitative and quantitative measures 
demonstrate the superiority of MC-LDA.

2  Related Work 
Sentiment analysis has been studied extensively in 
recent years (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 
2008; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wiebe et al, 2004). 
According to (Liu, 2012), there are three main ap-
proaches to aspect extraction: 1) Using word fre-
quency and syntactic dependency of aspects and 
sentiment words for extraction (e.g., Blair-
goldensohn et al, 2008; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ku et 
al., 2006; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al, 
2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al, 
2009; Yu et al, 2011; Zhang and Liu, 2011; 
Zhuang et al, 2006); 2) Using supervised se-
quence labeling/classification (e.g., Choi and 
Cardie, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; 
Kobayashi et al, 2007; Li et al, 2010); 3) Topic 
models (Branavan et al, 2008; Brody and Elhadad, 
2010; Fang and Huang, 2012; Jo and Oh, 2011; 
Kim et al, 2013; Lazaridou et al, 2013; Li et al, 
2011; Lin and He, 2009; Lu et al, 2009, 2012, 
2011; Lu and Zhai, 2008; Mei et al, 2007; 
Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 
2012; Sauper et al, 2011; Titov and McDonald, 
2008; Wang et al, 2010, 2011; Zhao et al, 2010). 
Other approaches include shallow semantic pars-
ing (Li et al, 2012b), bootstrapping (Xia et al, 
2009), Non-English techniques (Abu-Jbara et al, 
2013; Zhou et al, 2012), graph-based representa-
tion (Wu et al, 2011), convolution kernels 
(Wiegand and Klakow, 2010) and domain adap-
tion (Li et al, 2012). Stoyanov and Cardie (2011), 
Wang and Liu (2011), and Meng et al (2012) 
studied opinion summarization outside the reviews. 
Some other works related with sentiment analysis 
include (Agarwal and Sabharwal, 2012; Kennedy 
and Inkpen, 2006; Kim et al, 2009; Mohammad et 
al., 2009). 
In this work, we focus on topic models owing to 
their advantage of performing both aspect extrac-
tion and clustering simultaneously. All other ap-
proaches only perform extraction. Although there 
are several related works on clustering aspect 
terms (e.g., Carenini et al, 2005; Guo et al, 2009; 
Zhai et al, 2011), they all assume that the aspect 
terms have been extracted beforehand. We also 
notice that some aspect extraction models in sen-
timent analysis separately discover aspect words 
and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper 
and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al, 2010). Our pro-
posed model does not separate them as most sen-
timent words also imply aspects and most adjec-
tives modify specific attributes of objects. For ex-
ample, sentiment words expensive and beautiful 
imply aspects price and appearance respectively. 
Regarding the knowledge-based models, be-
sides those discussed in ? 1, the model (Hu et al, 
2011) enables the user to provide guidance interac-
tively. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) and Ramage et 
al. (2009) used document labels in supervised set-
ting. In (Chen et al, 2013a), we proposed MDK-
LDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which 
serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in 
MC-LDA. In (Chen et al, 2013b), we proposed a 
framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal 
with the wrong knowledge when exploring the 
lexical semantic relations as the general (domain 
independent) knowledge in topic models. But 
these models above did not consider the 
knowledge in the form of c-sets (or cannot-links). 
The generalized P?lya urn (GPU) model 
(Mahmoud, 2008) was first introduced in LDA by 
Mimno et al (2011). However, Mimno et al (2011) 
did not use domain knowledge. Our results in ? 7 
show that using domain knowledge can signifi-
cantly improve aspect extraction. The GPU model 
was also employed in topic models in our work of 
(Chen et al, 2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we pro-
pose the Extended GPU (E-GPU) model. The E-
GPU model is more powerful in handling complex 
situations in dealing with c-sets. 
3 Dealing with M-sets and Multiple Senses 
Since the proposed MC-LDA model is a major 
extension to our earlier work in (Chen et al, 
2013a), which can deal with m-sets, we include 
this earlier work here as the background.     
To incorporate m-sets and deal with multiple 
senses of a word, the MDK-LDA(b) model was 
proposed in (Chen et al, 2013a), which adds a 
new latent variable ? into LDA. The rationale here 
is that this new latent variable ? guides the model 
to choose the right sense represented by an m-set. 
The generative process of MDK-LDA(b) is (the 
notations are explained in Table 1): 
                     ?  ~ ?????????(?) 
                     ??|??  ~ ???????????(??) 
                     ? ~ ?????????(?) 
                     ??|??,? ~ ???????????????? 
                     ? ~ ?????????(?) 
                     ??|?? , ??,? ~ ???????????????,??? 
1657
The corresponding plate is shown in Figure 1. Un-
der MDK-LDA(b), the probability of word ? giv-
en topic ?, i.e., ??(?), is given by: 
 ??(?) = ? ??(?) ? ??,?(?)
?
?=1    (1) 
where ??(?)  denotes the probability of m-set ? 
occurring under topic ? and ??,?(?) is the proba-
bility of word ? appearing in m-set ? under topic ?. 
According to (Chen et al, 2013a), the condi-
tional probability of Gibbs sampler for MDK-
LDA(b) is given by (see notations in Table 1): 
    ???? = ?, ?? = ? ???? , ??? ,?,?,?, ?? ?

? ???,??
?? + ?????=1

The superscript ??  denotes the counts excluding 
the current assignments (?? and ??) for word ??. 
4 Handling Adverse Effect of Knowledge 
4.1 Generalized P?lya urn (GPU) Model 
The P?lya urn model involves an urn containing 
balls of different colors. At discrete time intervals, 
balls are added or removed from the urn according 
to their color distributions. 
In the simple P?lya urn (SPU) model, a ball is 
first drawn randomly from the urn and its color is 
recorded, then that ball is put back along with a 
new ball of the same color. This selection process 
is repeated and the contents of the urn change over 
time, with a self-reinforcing property sometimes 
expressed as ?the rich get richer.? SPU is actually 
exhibited in the Gibbs sampling for LDA.  
The generalized P?lya urn (GPU) model differs 
from the SPU model in the replacement scheme 
during sampling. Specifically, when a ball is ran-
domly drawn, certain numbers of additional balls 
of each color are returned to the urn, rather than 
just two balls of the same color as in SPU. 
4.2 Promoting M-sets using GPU 
To deal with the issue of sensitivity to the adverse 
effect of knowledge, MDK-LDA(b) is extended to 
MDK-LDA which employs the generalized P?lya 
urn (GPU) sampling scheme. 
As discussed in ? 1, due to the problem of the 
adverse effect of knowledge, important words may 
suffer from the presence of rare words in the same 
m-set. This problem can be dealt with the very 
sampling scheme of the GPU model (Chen et al, 
2013a). Specifically, by adding additional ??,??,? 
balls of color ? into ??
?  while keeping the drawn 
ball, we increase the proportion (probability) of 
seeing the m-set ? under topic ? and thus promote 
m-set ? as a whole. Consequently, each word in ? 
is more likely to be emitted. We define ??,??,? as: 
 ??,??,? = ?
1           ? = ??                                   
?           ? ? ?,?? ? ?,? ? ??        
 0           otherwise

5 Incorporating C-sets 
5.1 Extended Generalized P?lya urn Model 
To handle the complex situation resulted from in-
corporating c-sets, we propose an Extended gener-
alized P?lya urn (E-GPU) model. Instead of 
involving only one urn as in SPU and GPU, E-
GPU model considers a set of urns in the sampling 
process. The E-GPU model allows a ball to be 
transferred from one urn to another, enabling mul-
ti-urn interactions. Thus, during sampling, the 
populations of several urns will evolve even if on-
ly one ball is drawn from one urn. This capability 
makes the E-GPU model more powerful as it 
models relationships among multiple urns. 
We define three sets of urns which will be used 
in the new sampling scheme in the proposed MC-
LDA model. The first set of urns is the topic urns 
???{1??}
? , where each topic urn contains ? colors 
(topics) and each ball inside has a color ? ?
 {1 ??}. It corresponds to the document-topic dis-
tribution ? in Table 1. The second set of urns (m-
set urn ??? {1??}
? )  corresponds to the topic-m-set 
distribution ? , with balls of colors (m-sets) 
? ?  {1 ? ?}  in each m-set urn. The third set of 
urns is the word urns ??,?
? ,where ? ?  {1 ??} and 
? ?  {1 ? ?} . Each ball inside a word urn has a 
color (word) ? ?  {1 ??}. The distribution ? can 
be reflected in this set of urns. 
5.2 Handling C-sets using E-GPU 
As MDK-LDA can only use m-sets but not c-sets, 
we now extend MDK-LDA to the MC-LDA model 
in order to exploit c-sets. As pointed out in ? 1, c-
sets may be inconsistent with the corpus domain, 
which makes them considerably harder to deal 
with. To tackle the issue, we utilize the proposed 
E-GPU model and incorporate c-sets handling in-
side the E-GPU sampling scheme, which is also 
designed to enable automated adjustment of the 
number of topics based on domain knowledge. 
Based on the definition of c-set, each pair of 
words in a c-set cannot both have large probabili-
ties under the same topic. As the E-GPU model 
allows multi-urn interactions, when sampling a 
ball represents word ? from a word urn ??,?
? , we 
want to transfer the balls representing cannot-
words of ? (sharing a c-set with ?) to other urns 
(see Step 3 a below). That is, decrease the proba-
bilities of those cannot-words under this topic 
while increasing their corresponding probabilities 
under some other topics. In order to correctly 
transfer a ball that represents word ?, it should be 
transferred to an urn which has a higher proportion 
of ? and its related words (i.e., words sharing m-
sets with ?). That is, we randomly sample an urn 
that has a higher proportion of any m-set of ? to 
transfer ? to (Step 3 b below). However, the situa-
tion becomes more involved when a c-set is not 
consistent with the corpus. For example, aspects 
price and amazon may be mixed under one topic 
(say ?) in LDA. The user may want to separate 
them by providing a c-set {price, amazon}. In this 
case, according to LDA, word price has no topic 
with a higher proportion of it (and its related 
words) than topic ?. To transfer it, we need to in-
crement the number of topics by 1 and then trans-
fer the word to this new topic urn (step 3 c below). 
Based on these ideas, we propose the E-GPU sam-
pling scheme for the MC-LDA model below: 
1. Sample a topic ? from ??
? , an m-set ? from ??
?, and 
a word ?  from ??,?
?  sequentially, where ?  is the 
?th document. 
2. Record ?, ? and ?, put back two balls of color ? in-
to urn ??
? , one ball of color ? into urn ??
?, and two 
balls of color ? into urn ??,?
? . Given the matrix ? 
(in Equation 3), for each word ?? ? ?, we put back 
??,?? ,? number of balls of color ? into urn ??
?. 
3.  For each word ?? that shares a c-set with ?: 
a) Sample an m-set ??  from ??
?  which satisfies 
?? ? ?? . Draw a ball ? of color ?? (to be trans-
ferred) from ??,??
?  and remove it from ??,??
? . The 
document of ball ? is denoted by ??. If no ball 
of color ?? can be drawn (i.e., there is no ball 
of color ?? in ??,??
? ), skip steps b) to d). 
b) Produce an urn set {???,??
? } such that each urn in 
it satisfies the following conditions: 
i)   ?? ? ?, ?? ? ?
? 
ii) The proportion of balls of color ?? in ???
?  is    
higher than that of balls of color ??  in ??
?. 
c) If {???,??
? } is not empty, randomly select one urn 
???,??
?  from it. If {???,??
? } is empty, set ? = ? +
1, ?? = ?, draw an m-set ?? from ???
?  which sat-
isfies ?? ? ?
?. Record ?? for step d). 
d) Put the ball ? drawn from Step a) into ???,??
? , as 
well as a ball of color ?? into ???
?  and a ball of 
color ?? into ???
? . 
Note that the E-GPU model cannot be reflected in 
the graphical model in Figure 1 as it is essentially 
1659
sampling scheme, and hence MC-LDA shares the 
same plate as MDK-LDA(b). 
6 Collapsed Gibbs Sampling 
We now describe the collapsed Gibbs sampler 
(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) with the detailed 
conditional distributions and algorithms for MC-
LDA. Inference of ? and ? can be computationally 
expensive due to the non-exchangeability of words 
under the E-GPU models. We take the approach of 
(Mimno et al, 2011) which approximates the true 
Gibbs sampling distribution by treating each word 
as if it were the last. 
For each word ?? , we perform hierarchical 
sampling consisting of the following three steps 
(the detailed algorithms are given in Figures 2 and 
3): 
Step 1 (Lines 1-11 in Figure 2): We jointly 
sample a topic ??  and an m-set ??  (containing ??) 
for ?? , which gives us a blocked Gibbs sampler 
(Ishwaran and James, 2001), with the conditional 
probability given by: 
     ?(?? = ?, ?? = ?|?
?? , ??? ,?,?,?, ?,?) ?
     
??,?
?? +?
? ??
?,??
?? +???
??=1
?
? ? ??,??,?? ???,?,??

??=1
?
??=1 +?
? ?? ? ???,??,?????,??,??

??=1

+???
??=1
?
     
??,?,??
?? +??
? ??
?,?,??
?? +???
?
??=1
  
 (4) 
This step is the same as the Gibbs sampling for the 
MDK-LDA model. 
Step 2 (lines 1-5 in Figure 3): For every cannot-
word (say ??) of ??, randomly pick an urn ???,??
?  
from the urn set {???,??
? } where ??? ? ??. If there ex-
ists at least one ball of color ?? in urn ???,??
? , we 
sample one ball (say ?? ) of color ??  from urn 
???,??
? , based on the following conditional distribu-
tion: 
     ?(? = ??|?, ?,?,?,?, ?,?) ?
???,?+?
? ????,??
+???
??=1
  (5) 
where ??  denotes the document of the ball ??  of

accordingly. 
7 Experiments 
We now evaluate the proposed MC-LDA model 
and compare it with state-of-the-art existing mod-
els. Two unsupervised baseline models that we 
compare with are:  
? LDA: LDA is the basic unsupervised topic 
model (Blei et al, 2003). 
? LDA-GPU: LDA with GPU (Mimno et al, 
2011). Specifically, LDA-GPU applies GPU in 
LDA using co-document frequency.  
As for knowledge-based models, we focus on 
comparing with DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et 
al., 2009), which is perhaps the best known 
knowledge-based model and it allows both must-
links and cannot-links.  
For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider 
the following variations of MC-LDA and DF-LDA:  
? MC-LDA: MC-LDA with both m-sets and c-
sets. This is the newly proposed model.   
? M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is 
the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al, 2013a). 
? DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. 
? DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and 
cannot-links. This is the full DF-LDA model in 
(Andrzejewski et al, 2009).  
We do not compare with seeded models in (Burns 
et al, 2012; Jagarlamudi et al, 2012; Lu et al, 
2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) as seed sets are 
special cases of must-links and they also do not 
allow c-sets (or cannot-links). 
7.1 Datasets and Settings 
Datasets: We use product reviews from four do-
mains (types of products) from Amazon.com for 
evaluation. The corpus statistics are shown in Ta-
ble 2 (columns 2 and 3). The domains are ?Cam-
era,? ?Food,? ?Computer,? and ?Care? (short for 
?Personal Care?). We have made the datasets pub-
lically available at the website of the first author. 
Pre-processing: We ran the Stanford Core NLP 
Tools1 to perform sentence detection and lemmati-
zation. Punctuations, stopwords 2 , numbers and 
words appearing less than 5 times in each corpus 
were removed. The domain name was also re-
moved, e.g., word camera in the domain ?Camera?, 
since it co-occurs with most words in the corpus, 
leading to high similarity among topics/aspects. 
Sentences as documents: As noted in (Titov and 
McDonald, 2008), when standard topic models are 
applied to reviews as documents, they tend to pro-
duce topics that correspond to global properties of 
products (e.g., brand name), which make topics 
overlapping with each other. The reason is that all 
reviews of the same type of products discuss about 
the same aspects of these products. Only the brand 
names and product names are different. Thus, us-
ing individual reviews for modeling is not very 
effective. Although there are approaches which 
model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and 
McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody 
and Elhadad, 2010), dividing each review into sen-
tences and treating each sentence as an independ-
ent document. Sentences can be used by all three 
baselines without any change to their models. Alt-
hough the relationships between sentences are lost, 
the data is fair to all models. 
Parameter settings: For all models, posterior in-
ference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations 
with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all 
models, we set ? = 1 and ? = 0.1. We found that 
small changes of ? and ? did not affect the results 
much, which was also reported in (Jo and Oh, 
2011) who also used online reviews. For the num-
ber of topics T, we tried different values (see ?7.2) 
as it is hard to know the exact number of topics. 
While non-parametric Bayesian approaches (Teh 
et al, 2006) aim to estimate ?  from the corpus, 
they are often sensitive to the hyper-parameters 
(Heinrich, 2009).

For DF-LDA, we followed (Andrzejewski et al, 
2009) to generate must-links and cannot-links 
from our domain knowledge. We then ran DF-
LDA3 while keeping its parameters as proposed in 
(Andrzejewski et al, 2009) (we also experimented 
with different parameter settings but they did not 
produce better results). For our proposed model, 
we estimated the thresholds using cross validation 
in our pilot experiments. Estimated value ? = 0.2 
in equation 3 yielded good results. The second 
stage (steps 2 and 3) of the Gibbs sampler for MC-
LDA (for dealing with c-sets) is applied after 
burn-in phrase. 
Domain knowledge: User knowledge about a do-
main can vary a great deal. Different users may 
have very different knowledge. To reduce this var-
iance for a more reliable evaluation, instead of 
asking a human user to provide m-sets, we obtain 
the synonym sets and the antonym sets of each 
word that is a noun or adjective (as words of other 
parts-of-speech usually do not indicate aspects) 
from WordNet (Miller, 1995) and manually verify 
the words in those sets for the domain. Note that if 
a word ?  is not provided with any m-set, it is 
treated as a singleton m-set {?}. For c-sets, we ran 
LDA in each domain and provide c-sets based on 
the wrong results of LDA as in (Andrzejewski et 
al., 2009). Then, the knowledge is provided to 
each model in the format required by each model. 
The numbers of m-sets and c-sets are listed in col-
umns 4 and 5 of Table 2. Duplicate sets have been 
removed. 
7.2 Objective Evaluation 
In this section, we evaluate our proposed MC-
3 http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~andrzeje/research/df_lda.html 
LDA model objectively. Topic models are often 
evaluated using perplexity on held-out test data. 
However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the 
semantic coherence of individual topics learned by 
a topic model (Newman et al, 2010). Recent re-
search has shown potential issues with perplexity 
as a measure: (Chang et al, 2009) suggested that 
the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human 
judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect 
our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate 
semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of 
how well the model fits the data. 
The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al, 
2011) (also called the ?UMass? measure (Stevens 
and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alter-
native for assessing topic quality. This metric re-
lies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the 
documents, and does not depend on external re-
sources or human labeling. It was shown that topic 
coherence is highly consistent with human expert 
labeling by Mimno et al (2011). Higher topic co-
herence score indicates higher quality of topics, 
i.e., better topic interpretability. 
Effects of Number of Topics 
Since our proposed models and the baseline mod-
els are all parametric models, we first compare 
each model given different numbers of topics. 
Figure 4 shows the average Topic Coherence score 
of each model given different numbers of topics. 
From Figure 4, we note the following: 
1. MC-LDA consistently achieves the highest To-
pic Coherence scores given different numbers 
of topics. M-LDA also works better than the 
other baseline models, but not as well as MC-
LDA. This shows that both m-sets and c-sets 
are beneficial in producing coherent aspects. 
2. DF-LDA variants, DF-M and DF-MC, do not 
perform well due to the shortcomings discussed

across different number of topics.

in ? 1. It is slightly better than LDA when ? = 
15, but worse than LDA in other cases. We will 
further analyze the effects of knowledge on 
MC-LDA and DF-LDA shortly. 
3. LDA-GPU does not perform well due to its use 
of co-document frequency. As frequent words 
usually have high co-document frequency with 
many other words, the frequent words are 
ranked top in many topics. This shows that the 
guidance using domain knowledge is more ef-
fective than using co-document frequency. 
In terms of improvements, MC-LDA outperforms 
M-LDA significantly ( ? < 0.03 ) and all other 
baseline models significantly (? < 0.01) based on 
a paired t-test. It is important to note that by no 
means do we say that LDA-GPU and DF-LDA are 
not effective. We only say that for the task of as-
pect extraction and leveraging domain knowledge, 
these models do not generate as coherent aspects 
as ours because of their shortcomings discussed in 
? 1. In general, with more topics, the Topic Coher-
ence scores increase. We found that when ?  is 
larger than 15, aspects found by each model be-
came more and more overlapping, with several 
aspects expressing the same features of products. 
So we fix ? = 15 in the subsequent experiments.  
Effects of Knowledge 
To further analyze the effects of knowledge on 
models, in each domain, we randomly sampled 
different proportions of knowledge (i.e., different 
numbers of m-sets/must-links and c-sets/cannot-
links) as shown in Figure 5, where 0% means no 
knowledge (same as LDA and LDA-GPU, which 
do not incorporate knowledge) and 100% means 
all knowledge. From Figure 5, we see that MC-
LDA and M-LDA both perform consistently better 
than DF-MC and DF-M across different propor-
tions of knowledge. With the increasing number of 
knowledge sets, MC-LDA and M-LDA achieve 
higher Topic Coherence scores (i.e., produce more 
coherent aspects). In general, MC-LDA performs 
the best. For both DF-MC and DF-M, the Topic 
Coherence score increases from 0% to 25% 
knowledge, but decreases with more knowledge 
(50% and 100%). This shows that with limited 
amount of knowledge, the shortcomings of DF-
LDA are not very obvious, but with more 
knowledge, these issues become more serious and 
thus degrade the performance of DF-LDA.  
7.3 Human Evaluation 
Since our aim is to make topics more interpretable 
and conformable to human judgments, we worked 
with two judges who are familiar with Amazon 
products and reviews to evaluate the models sub-
jectively. Since topics from topic models are rank-
ings based on word probability and we do not 
know the number of correct topical words, a natu-
ral way to evaluate these rankings is to use Preci-
sion@n (or p@n) which was also used in 
(Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al, 2010), 
where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 
5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: 
topic labeling and word labeling. 
Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in 
(Mimno et al, 2011) and asked the judges to label 
each topic as good or bad. Each topic was present-
ed as a list of 10 most probable words in descend-
ing order of their probabilities under that topic. 
The models which generated the topics for label-
ing were obscure to the judges. In general, each 
topic was annotated as good if it had more than 
half of its words coherently related to each other 
representing a semantic concept together; other-
wise bad. Agreement of human judges on topic

labeling using Cohen?s Kappa yielded a score of 
0.92 indicating almost perfect agreements accord-
ing to the scale in (Landis and Koch, 1977). This 
is reasonable as topic labeling is an easy task and 
semantic coherence can be judged well by humans. 
Word Labeling: After topic labeling, we chose 
the topics, which were labeled as good by both 
judges, as good topics. Then, we asked the two 
judges to label each word of the top 10 words in 
these good topics. Each word was annotated as 
correct if it was coherently related to the concept 
represented by the topic; otherwise incorrect. 
Since judges already had the conception of each 
topic in mind when they were labeling topics, la-
beling each word was not difficult which explains 
the high Kappa score for this labeling task (score = 
0.892). 
Quantitative Results 
Figures 6 and 7 give the average p@5 and p@10 
of all good topics over all four domains. The num-
bers of good topics generated by each model are 
shown in Table 3. We can see that the human 
evaluation results are highly consistent with Topic 
Coherence results in ?7.2. MC-LDA improves 
over M-LDA significantly (? < 0.01) and both 
MC-LDA and M-LDA outperforms the other base-
line models significantly ( ? < 0.005 ) using a 
paired t-test. We also found that when the domain 
knowledge is simple with one word usually ex-
pressing only one meaning/sense (e.g., in the do-
main ?Computer?), DF-LDA performs better than 
LDA. In other domains, it performs similarly or 
worse than LDA. Again, it shows that DF-LDA is 
not effective to handle complex knowledge, which 
is consistent with the results of effects of 
knowledge on DF-LDA in ?7.2. 
Qualitative Results 
We now show some qualitative results to give an 
intuitive feeling of the outputs from different mod-
els. There are a large number of aspects that are 
dramatically improved by MC-LDA. Due to space 
constraints, we only show some examples. To fur-
ther focus, we just show some results of MC-LDA, 
M-LDA and LDA. The results from LDA-GPU 
and DF-LDA were inferior and hard for the human 
judges to match them with aspects found by the 
other models for qualitative comparison. 
Table 4 shows three aspects Amazon, Price, 
Battery generated by each model in the domain 
?Camera?. Both LDA and M-LDA can only dis-
cover two aspects but M-LDA has a higher aver-
age precision. Given the c-set {amazon, price, 
battery}, MC-LDA can discover all three aspects 
with the highest average precision. 
8 Conclusion  
This paper proposed a new model to exploit do-
main knowledge in the form of m-sets and c-sets 
to generate coherent aspects (topics) from online 
reviews. The paper first identified and character-
ized some shortcomings of the existing 
knowledge-based models. A new model called 
MC-LDA was then proposed, whose sampling 
scheme was based on the proposed Extended GPU 
(E-GPU) model enabling multi-urn interactions. A 
comprehensive evaluation using real-life online 
reviews from multiple domains shows that MC-
LDA outperforms the state-of-the-art models sig-
nificantly and discovers aspects with high seman-
tic coherence. In our future work, we plan to 
incorporate aspect specific sentiments in the MC-
LDA model.

Abstract 
This paper proposes to study the problem of 
identifying intention posts in online discus-
sion forums. For example, in a discussion fo-
rum, a user wrote ?I plan to buy a camera,? 
which indicates a buying intention. This in-
tention can be easily exploited by advertisers. 
To the best of our knowledge, there is still no 
reported study of this problem. Our research 
found that this problem is particularly suited 
to transfer learning because in different do-
mains, people express the same intention in 
similar ways. We then propose a new transfer 
learning method which, unlike a general 
transfer learning algorithm, exploits several 
special characteristics of the problem. Exper-
imental results show that the proposed meth-
od outperforms several strong baselines, 
including supervised learning in the target 
domain and a recent transfer learning meth-
od. 
1 Introduction 
Social media content is increasingly regarded as 
an information gold mine. Researchers have stud-
ied many problems in social media, e.g., senti-
ment analysis (Pang & Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010) and 
social network analysis (Easley & Kleinberg, 
2010). In this paper, we study a novel problem 
which is also of great value, namely, intention 
identification, which aims to identify discussion 
posts expressing certain user intentions that can be 
exploited by businesses or other interested parties. 
For example, one user wrote, ?I am looking for a 
brand new car to replace my old Ford Focus?. 
Identifying such intention automatically can help 
social media sites to decide what ads to display so 
that the ads are more likely to be clicked. 
This work focuses on identifying user posts 
with explicit intentions. By explicit we mean that 
the intention is explicitly stated in the text, no 
need to deduce (hidden or implicit intention). For 
example, in the above sentence, the author clearly 
expressed that he/she wanted to buy a car. On the 
other hand, an example of an implicit sentence is 
?Anyone knows the battery life of iPhone?? The 
person may or may not be thinking about buying 
an iPhone. 
To our knowledge, there is no reported study of 
this problem in the context of text documents. The 
main related work is in Web search, where user 
(or query) intent classification is a major issue 
(Hu et al, 2009; Li, 2010; Li, Wang, & Acero, 
2008). Its task is to determine what the user is 
searching for based on his/her keyword queries (2 
to 3 words) and his/her click data. We will discuss 
this and other related work in Section 2. 
We formulate the proposed problem as a two-
class classification problem since an application 
may only be interested in a particular intention. 
We define intention posts (positive class) as the 
posts that explicitly express a particular intention 
of interest, e.g., the intention to buy a product. 
The other posts are non-intention posts (negative 
class). Note that we do not exploit intention spe-
cific knowledge since our aim is to propose a ge-
neric method applicable to different types of 
intentions. 
There is an important feature about this prob-
lem which makes it amenable to transfer learning 
so that we do not need to label data in every do-
main. That is, for a particular kind of intention 
such as buying, the ways to express the intention 
in different domains are often very similar. This 
1041
fact can be exploited to build a classifier based on 
labeled data in some domains and apply it to a 
new/target domain without labeling any training 
data in the target domain. However, this problem 
also has some special difficulties that existing 
general transfer learning methods do not deal 
with. The two special difficulties of the proposed 
problem are as follows: 
1. In an intention post, the intention is typically 
expressed in only one or two sentences while 
most sentences do not express intention, which 
provide very noisy data for classifiers. Fur-
thermore, words/phrases used for expressing 
intention are quite limited compared to other 
types of expressions. These mean that the set 
of shared (or common) features in different 
domains is very small. Most of the existing ad-
vanced transfer learning methods all try to ex-
tract and exploit these shared features. The 
small number of such features in our task 
makes it hard for the existing methods to find 
them accurately, which in turn learn poorer 
classifiers. 
2. As mentioned above, in different domains, the 
ways to express the same intention are often 
similar. This means that only the positive (in-
tention) features are shared among different 
domains, while features indicating the negative 
class in different domains are very diverse. We 
then have an imbalance problem, i.e., the 
shared features are almost exclusively features 
indicating the positive class. To our 
knowledge, none of the existing transfer learn-
ing methods deals with this imbalance problem 
of shared features, which also results in inaccu-
rate classifiers.  
We thus propose a new transfer learning (or do-
main adaptation) method, called Co-Class, which, 
unlike a general transfer learning method, is able 
to deal with these difficulties in solving the prob-
lem. Co-Class works as follows: we first build a 
classifier   using the labeled data from existing 
domains, called the source data, and then apply 
the classifier to classify the target (domain) data 
(which is unlabeled). Based on the target data la-
beled by  , we perform a feature selection on the 
target data. The selected set of features is used to 
build two classifiers, one (  ) from the labeled 
source data and one (  ) from the target data 
which has been labeled by  . The two classifiers 
(   and   ) then work together to perform classi-
fication of the target data. The process then runs 
iteratively until the labels assigned to the target 
data stabilize. Note that in each iteration both 
classifiers are built using the same set of features 
selected from the target domain in order to focus 
on the target domain. The proposed Co-Class ex-
plicitly deals with the difficulties mentioned 
above (see Section 3). Our experiments using four 
real-life data sets extracted from four forum dis-
cussion sites show that Co-Class outperforms sev-
eral strong baselines. What is also interesting is 
that it works even better than fully supervised 
learning in the target domain itself, i.e., using both 
training and test data in the target domain. It also 
outperforms a recent state-of-the-art transfer 
learning method (Tan et al, 2009), which has 
been successfully applied to the NLP task of sen-
timent classification.  
In summary, this paper makes two main contri-
butions: 
1. It proposes to study the novel problem of inten-
tion identification. User intention is an im-
portant type of information in social media 
with many applications. To our knowledge, 
there is still no reported study of this problem.  
2. It proposes a new transfer learning method Co-
Class which is able to exploit the above two 
key issues/characteristics of the problem in 
building cross-domain classifiers. Our experi-
mental results demonstrate its effectiveness. 
2 Related Work 
Although we have not found any paper studying 
intention classification of social media posts, there 
are some related works in the domain of Web 
search, where user or query intent classification is 
a major issue (Hu et al, 2009; Li, 2010; Li et al, 
2008). The task there is to classify a query submit-
ted to a search engine to determine what the user 
is searching for. It is different from our problem 
because they classify based on the user-submitted 
keyword queries (often 2 to 3 words) together 
with the user?s click-through data (which repre-
sent the user?s behavior). Such intents are typical-
ly implicit because people usually do not issue a 
search query like ?I want to buy a digital cam-
era.? Instead, they may just type the keywords 
?digital camera?. Our interest is to identify explic-
it intents expressed in full text documents (forum 
posts). Another related problem is online com-
mercial intention (OCI) identification (Dai et al, 
1042
2006; Hu et al, 2009), which focuses on capturing 
commercial intention based on a user query and 
web browsing history. In this sense, OCI is still a 
user query intent problem. 
In NLP, (Kanayama & Nasukawa, 2008) stud-
ied users? needs and wants from opinions. For 
example, they aimed to identify the user needs 
from sentences such as ?I?d be happy if it is 
equipped with a crisp LCD.? This is clearly dif-
ferent from our explicit intention to buy or to use 
a product/service, e.g., ?I plan to buy a new TV.? 
Our proposed Co-Class technique is related to 
transfer learning or domain adaptation. The pro-
posed method belongs to ?feature representation 
transfer" from source domain to target domain 
(Pan & Yang, 2010). Aue & Gamon (2005) tried 
training on a mixture of labeled reviews from oth-
er domains where such data are available and test 
on the target domain. This is basically one of our 
baseline methods 3TR-1TE in Section 4. Their 
work does not do multiple iterations and does not 
build two separate classifiers as we do. Some re-
lated methods were also proposed in (W. Dai, 
Xue, Yang & Yu, 2007; Tan et al, 2007; Yang, Si 
& Callan, 2006). More sophisticated transfer 
learning methods try to find common features in 
both the source and target domains and then try to 
map the differences of the two domains (Blitzer, 
Dredze, & Pereira, 2007; Pan, et al 2010; Bolle-
gala, Weir & Carroll, 2011; Tan et al, 2009). 
Some researchers also used topic modeling of 
both domains to transfer knowledge (Gao & Li, 
2011; He, Lin & Alani, 2011). However, none of 
these methods deals with the two prob-
lems/difficulties of our task. Co-Class tackles 
them explicitly and effectively (Section 4). 
The proposed Co-Class method is also related 
to Co-Training method in (Blum & Mitchell, 
1998). We will compare them in detail in Section 
3.3. 
3 The Proposed Technique 
We now present the proposed technique. Our ob-
jective is to perform classification in the target 
domain by utilizing labeled data from the source 
domains. We use the term ?source domains? as 
we can combine labeled data from multiple source 
domains. The target domain has no labeled data. 
Only the source domain data are labeled. 
To deal with the first problem in Section 1 (i.e., 
the difficulty of finding common features across 
different domains), Co-Class avoids it by using an 
EM-based method to iteratively transfer from the 
source domains to the target domain while ex-
ploiting feature selection in the target domain to 
focus on important features in the target domain. 
Since our ideas are developed starting from the 
EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm and its 
shortcomings, we now introduce EM. 
3.1 EM Algorithm 
EM (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) is a popu-
lar class of iterative algorithms for maximum like-
lihood estimation in problems with incomplete 
data. It is often used to address missing values in 
the data by computing expected values using ex-
isting values. The EM algorithm consists of two 
steps, the Expectation step (E-step) and the Max-
imization step (M-step). E-step basically fills in 
the missing data, and M-step re-estimates the pa-
rameters. This process iterates until convergence. 
Since our target data have no labels, which can be 
treated as missing values/data, the EM algorithm 
naturally applies. For text classification, each iter-
ation of EM (Nigam, McCallum, Thrun, & Mitch-
ell, 2000) usually uses the na?ve Bayes (NB) 
classifier. Below, we first introduce the NB classi-
fier. 
Given a set of training documents  , each doc-
ument      is an ordered list of words. We use 
      to denote the word in the position   of   , 
where each word is from the vocabulary    
         | | , which is the set of all words con-
sidered in classification. We also have a set of 
classes         representing positive and neg-
ative classes. For classification, we compute the 
posterior probability      |   . Based on the 
Bayes rule and multinomial model, we have: 
      
   (1) 
 
and with Laplacian smoothing: 
    (2) 
where          is the number of times that the 
word    occurs in document   , and   (  |  )  
      is the probability of assigning class    to   . 
Assuming that word probabilities are independent 
given a class, we have the NB classifier:

The EM algorithm basically builds a classifier 
iteratively using NB and both the labeled source 
data and the unlabeled target data. However, the 
major shortcoming is that the feature set, even 
with feature selection, may fit the labeled source 
data well but not the target data because the target 
data has no labels to be used in feature selection. 
Feature selection is shown to be very important 
for this application as we will see in Section 4. 
3.2 FS-EM 
Based on the discussion above, the key to solve 
the problem of EM is to find a way to reflect the 
features in the target domain during the iterations. 
We propose two alternatives, FS-EM (Feature 
Selection EM) and Co-Class (Co-Classification). 
This sub-section presents FS-EM. 
EM can select features only before iterations 
using the labeled source data and keep using the 
same features in each iteration. However, these 
features only fit the labeled source data but not the 
target data. We then propose to select features 
during iterations, i.e., after each iteration, we re-
do feature selection. For this, we use the predicted 
classes of the target data. In na?ve Bayes, we de-
fine the predicted class for document    as 
 
        
    
     |    (4) 
The detailed algorithm for FS-EM is given in 
Figure 1. First, we select a feature set from the 
labeled source data    and then build an initial 
NB classifier (lines 1 and 2). The feature selection 
is based on Information Gain, which will be intro-
duced in Section 3.4. After that, we classify each 
document in the target data    to obtain its pre-
dicted class (lines 4-6). A new target data set    
is produced in line 7, which is    with added 
classes (predicted in line 5). Line 8 selects a new 
feature set   from the data    (which is discussed 
below), from which a new classifier   is built 
(line 9). The iteration stops when the predicted 
classes of    do not change any more (line 10). 
We now turn to the data set   , which can be 
formed with one of the two methods: 
1.          
2.       
The first method (called FS-EM1) merges the 
labeled source data    and the target data    
(with predicted classes). However, this method 
does not work well because the labeled source 
data can dominate    and the target domain fea-
tures are still not well represented. 
The second method (     ), denoted as FS-
EM2, selects features from the target domain data 
   only based on the predicted classes. The clas-
sifiers are built in iterations (lines 3-10) using on-
ly the target domain data. The weakness of this is 
that it completely ignores the labeled source data 
after initialization, but the source data does con-
tain some valuable information. Our final pro-
posed method Co-Class is able to solve this 
problem. 
3.3 Co-Class 
Co-Class is our final proposed algorithm. It con-
siders both the source labeled data and the target 
data with predicted classes. It uses the idea of FS-
EM, but is also inspired by Co-Training in (Blum 
& Mitchell, 1998). It additionally deals with the 
second issue identified in Section 1 (i.e., the im-
balance of shared positive and negative features). 
Co-Training is originally designed for semi-
supervised learning to learn from a small labeled 
and a large unlabeled set of training examples, 
which assumes the set of features in the data can 
be partitioned into two subsets, and each subset is 
sufficient for building an accurate classifier. The 
proposed Co-Class model is similar to Co-
Training in that it also builds two classifiers. 
However, unlike Co-Training, Co-Class does not 
partition the feature space. Instead, one classifier 
is built based on the target data with predicted 
classes (  ), and the other classifier is built using 
only the source labeled data (  ). Both classifiers 
use the same features (this is an important point) 
that are selected from the target data    only, in 
order to focus on the target domain. The final 
classification is based on both classifiers. Fur-
thermore, Co-Training only uses the data from the 
same domain. 
The detailed Co-Class algorithm is given in 
Figure 2. Lines 1-6 are the same as lines 1, 2 and 
4-7 in FS-EM. Line 8 selects new features   from 
  . Two na?ve Bayes classifiers,    and   , are 
then built using the source data    and predicted 
target data    respectively with the same set of

ers.  (             ) is the aggregate function to 
combine the results of two classifiers. It is defined 
as: 
 (             )  {
                          
                                      
  
This aims to deal with the imbalanced feature 
problem. As discussed before, the expressions for 
stating a particular intention (e.g., buying) are 
very similar across domains but the non-intention 
expressions across domains are highly diverse, 
which result in strong positive features and weak 
negative features. We then need to restrict the 
positive class by requiring both classifiers to give 
positive predictions. If we use the method in Co-
Training (multiplying the probabilities of the two 
NB classifiers), the classification results deterio-
rate from iteration to iteration because the positive 
class recall gets higher and higher due to strong 
positive features, but the precision gets lower and 
lower. 
Since we build and use two classifiers for the 
final classification, we call the method Co-Class, 
short for Co-Classification. Co-Class is different 
from EM (Nigam et al, 2000) in two main aspects. 
First, it integrates feature selection into the itera-
tions, which has not been done before. Feature 
selection refines features to enhance the correla-
tion between the features and classes. Second, two 
classifiers are built based on different domains 
and combined to improve the classification. Only 
one classifier is built in existing EM methods, 
which gives poorer results (Section 4). 
3.4 Feature Selection 
As feature selection is important for our task, we 
briefly introduce the Information Gain (IG) meth-
od given in (Yang & Pedersen, 1997), which is a 
popular feature selection algorithm for text classi-
fication. IG is based on entropy reflecting the pu-
rity of the categories or classes by knowing the 
presence or absence of each feature, which is de-
fined as:

Using the IG value of each feature  , all fea-
tures can be ranked. As in normal classification 
tasks, the common practice is to use a set of top 
ranked features for classification. 
4 Evaluation 
We have conducted a comprehensive set of exper-
iments to compare the proposed Co-Class method 
with several strong baselines, including a state-of-
the-art transfer learning method.

For our experiments, we are interested in the in-
tention to buy, which is our intention or positive 
class. For each dataset, we manually labeled 1000 
posts. 
Labeling: We initially labeled about one fifth of 
posts by two human annotators. We found their 
labels highly agreed. We then used only one anno-
tator to complete the remaining labeling. The rea-
son for the strong labeling agreement is that we 
are interested in only explicit buying intentions, 
which are clearly expressed in each post, e.g., ?I 
am in the market for a new smartphone.? There is 
little ambiguity or subjectivity in labeling. 
To ensure that the task is realistic, for all da-
tasets we keep their original class distributions as 
they are extracted from their respective websites 
to reflect the real-life situation. The intention class 
is always the minority class, which makes it much 
harder to predict due to the imbalanced class dis-
tribution. Table 1 gives the statistics of each da-
taset. On average, each post contains about 7.5 
sentences and 122 words. We have made the da-
tasets used in this paper publically available at the 
websites of the first two authors.  
Evaluation measures: For all experiments, we 
use precision, recall and F1-score as the evalua-
tion measures. They are suitable because our ob-
jective is to identify intention posts. 
4.2 One Domain Learning 
The objective of our work is to classify the target 
domain instances without labeling any target do-
main data. To set the background, we first give 
the results of one domain learning, i.e., assuming 
that there is labeled training data in the target do-
main (which is the traditional fully supervised 
learning).  We want to see how the results of Co-
Class compare with the fully supervised learning. 
For this set of experiments, we use na?ve Bayes 
and SVM. For na?ve Bayes, we use the Lingpipe 
implementation (http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/). For 
SVM, we use SVMLight (Joachims, 1999) from 
(http://svmlight.joachims.org/) with the linear 
kernel as it has been shown by many researchers 
that linear kernel is sufficient for text classifica-
tion (Joachims, 1998; Yang and Liu, 1999). 
During labeling, we observed that the intention 
in an intention (positive) post is often expressed in 
the first few or the last few sentences. Hence, we 
tried to use the full post (denoted by Full), the first 
5 sentences (denoted by (5, 0)), and first 5 and last 
5 sentences (denoted by (5, 5)). We also experi-
mented with the first 3 sentences, and first 3 and 
last 3 sentences but their results were poorer. 
The experiments were done using 10-fold cross 
validation. For the number of selected features, 
we tried 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and all. We 
also tried unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-
grams. To compare na?ve Bayes with SVM, we 
tried each combination, i.e. number of features 
and n-grams, and found the best model for each 
method. We found that na?ve Bayes works best 
when using trigrams with 1500 selected features. 
Bigrams with 1000 features are the best combina-
tion for SVM. Figure 3 shows the comparison of 
the best results (F1-scores) of na?ve Bayes and 
SVM. 
From Figure 3, we make the following observa-
tions: 
1. SVM does not do well for this task. We tuned 
the parameters of SVM, but the results were 
similar to the default setting, and all were 
worse than na?ve Bayes. We believe the main 
reason is that the data for this application is 
highly noisy because apart from one or two in-
tention sentences, other sentences in an inten-
tion post have little difference from those in a 
non-intention post. SVM does not perform well 
with very noisy data. When there are data 
points far away from their own classes, SVM

Table 1: Datasets statistics with the buy intention

tends to be strongly affected by such points 
(Wu & Liu, 2007). Na?ve Bayes is more robust 
in the presence of noise due to its probabilistic 
nature. 
2. SVM using only the first few and/or last few 
sentences performs better than using full posts 
because full posts have more noise. However, 
it is still worse than na?ve Bayes. 
3. For na?ve Bayes, using full posts and the first 5 
and last 5 (5, 5) sentences give similar results, 
which is not surprising as (5, 5) has almost all 
the information needed. Without using the last 
5 sentence (5, 0), the results are poorer. 
We also found that without feature selection (us-
ing all features), the results are markedly worse 
for both na?ve Bayes and SVM. This is under-
standable (as we discussed earlier) because most 
words and sentences in both intention and non-
intention posts are very similar. Thus, feature se-
lection is highly desirable for this application. 
Effect of different combinations: Table 2 gives 
the detailed F1-score results of na?ve Bayes with 
best results in different n-grams (with best number 
of features). We can see that using trigrams pro-
duces the best results on average, but bigrams and 
4-grams are quite similar. It turns out that using 
trigrams with 1500 selected features performs the 
best. SVM results are not shown as they are poor-
er. 
In summary, we say that na?ve Bayes is more 
suitable than SVM for our application and feature 
selection is crucial. In our experiments reported 
below, we will only use na?ve Bayes with feature 
selection. 
4.3 Evaluation of Co-Class 
We now compare Co-Class with the baseline 
methods listed below. Note that for this set of ex-
periments, the source data all contain labeled 
posts from three domains and the target data con-
tain unlabeled posts in one domain. That is, for 
each target domain, we merge three other domains 
for training and the target domain for testing. For 
example, for the target of ?Cellphone?, the model 
is built using the data from the other three do-
mains (i.e., ?Electronics?, ?Camera? and ?TV?). 
The results are the classification of the model on 
the target domain ?Cellphone?. Several strong 
baselines are described as follows: 
3TR-1TE: Use labeled data from three do-
mains to train and then classify the target (test) 
domain. There is no iteration. This method was 
used in (Aue & Gamon, 2005). 
EM: This is the algorithm in Section 3.1. The 
combined data from three domains are used as the 
labeled source data. The data of the remaining one 
domain are used as the unlabeled target data, 
which is also used as the test data (since it is unla-
beled). 
ANB: This is a recent transfer learning method 
(Tan et al, 2009). ANB uses frequently co-
occurring entropy (FCE) to pick out generalizable 
(or shared) features that occur frequently in both 
the source and target domains. Then, a weighted 
transfer version of na?ve Bayes classifier is ap-
plied. We chose this method for comparison as it 
is a recent method, also based on na?ve Bayes, and 
has been applied to the NLP task of sentiment

classification, which to some extend is related to 
the proposed task of intention classification. ANB 
was also shown to perform better than EM and 
na?ve Bayes transfer learning method (Dai et al, 
2007). 
We look at the results of 3TR-1TE first, which 
are shown in Table 3. Due to space limitations, we 
only show the trigrams F1-scores as they perform 
the best on average. Table 3 gives the number of 
features with trigrams. We can observe that on 
average using 3000 features gives the best F1-
score results. It has 1000 more features than one 
domain learning because we now combine three 
domains (3000 posts) for training and thus more 
useful features. 
From Table 3, we observe that the F1-score re-
sults of 3TR-1TE are worse than those of one do-
main learning (Table 2), which is intuitive 
because no training data are used from the target 
domain. But the results are not dramatically worse 
which indicate that there are some common fea-
tures in different domains, meaning people ex-
pressing the same intention in similar ways. 
Since we found that trigrams with 3000 features 
perform the best on average, we run EM, FS-
EM1, FS-EM2 and Co-Class based on trigrams 
with 3000 features. For the baseline ANB, we 
tuned the parameters using a development set 
(1/10 of the training data). We found that select-
ing 2000 generalizable/shared features gives the 
best results (the default is 500 in (Tan et al, 
2009)). We kept ANB?s other original parameter 
values. The F1-scores (averages over all 4 da-
tasets) with the number of iterations are shown in 
Figure 4. Iteration 0 is the result of 3TR-1TE. 
From Figure 4, we can make the following obser-
vations: 
1. EM makes a little improvement in iteration 1. 
After that, the results deteriorate. The gain of 
iteration 1 shows that incorporating the target 
domain data (unlabeled) is helpful. However, 
the selected features from source domains can 
only fit the labeled source data but not the tar-
get data, which was explained in Section 3.1. 
2. ANB improves slightly from iteration 1 to iter-
ation 6, but the results are all worse than those 
of Co-Class. We checked the generaliza-
ble/shared features of ANB and found that they 
were not suitable for our problem since they 
were mainly adjectives, nouns and sentiment 
verbs, which do not have strong correlation 
with intentions. This shows that it is hard to 
find the truly shared features indicating inten-
tions. Furthermore, ANB?s results are almost 
the same as those of EM. 
3. FS-EM2 behaves similarly to FS-EM1. After 
two iterations, the results start to deteriorate. 
Selecting features only from the target domain 
makes sense since it can reflect target domain 
data well. However, it also becomes worse 
with the increased number of iterations, due to 
strong positive features. With increased itera-
tions, positive features get stronger due to the 
imbalanced feature problem discussed in Sec-
tion 1. 
4. Co-Class performs much better than all other 
methods. With the increased number of itera-
tions, the results actually improve. Starting 
from iteration 7, the results stabilize. Co-Class 
solves the problem of strong positive features 
by requiring strong conditions for positive 
classification and focusing on features in the 
target domain only. Although the detailed re-
sults of precision and recall are not shown, the 
Co-Class model actually improves the F1-score 
by improving both the precision and recall.  
Significance of improvement: We now discuss 
the significance of improvements by comparing 
the results of Co-Class with other models. Table 4 
summarizes the results among the models. For 
Co-Class, we use the converged models at itera-
tion 7. We also include the One Domain learning 
results which are from fully supervised classifica-
tion in the target domains with trigrams and 1500 
features. The results of 3TR-1TE, EM, ANB, FS-
EM1, and FS-EM2 are obtained based on their 
settings which give the best results in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4 ? Comparison EM, ANB, FS-EM1, FS-EM2, 
and Co-Class across iterations (0 is 3TR-1TE) 
1048
It is clear from Table 4 that Co-Class is the best 
method in general. It is even better than the fully 
supervised One-Domain learning, although their 
results are not strictly comparable because One-
Domain learning uses training and test data from 
the same domain via 10-fold cross validation, 
while all other methods use one domain as the test 
data (the labeled data are from the other three do-
mains). One possible reason is that the labeled 
data are much bigger than those in One-Domain 
learning, which contain more expressions of buy-
ing intention. Note that FS-EM1 and FS-EM2 
work slightly better than Co-Class in domain 
?Camera? because it is the least noisy domain 
with very short posts while other domains (as 
source data) are quite noisy. With good quality 
data, FS-EM1 and FS-EM2 (also proposed in this 
paper) can do slightly better than Co-Class. Statis-
tical paired t-test shows that Co-Class performs 
significantly better than baseline methods 3TR-
1TE, EM, ANB and FS-EM1 at the confidence 
level of 95%, and better than FS-EM2 at the con-
fidence level of 94%. 
Effect of the number of training domains: In 
our experiments above, we used 3 source domain 
data and tested on one target domain. We now 
show what happens if we use only one or two 
source domain data and test on one target domain. 
We tried all possible combinations of source and 
target data. Figure 5 gives the average results over 
the four target/test domains. We can see that using 
more source domains is better due to more labeled 
data. With more domains, Co-Class also improves 
more over 3TR-1TE. 
5 Conclusion 
This paper studied the problem of identifying in-
tention posts in discussion forums. The problem 
has not been studied in the social media context. 
Due to special characteristics of the problem, we 
found that it is particularly suited to transfer learn-
ing. A new transfer learning method, called Co-
Class, was proposed to solve the problem. Unlike 
a general transfer learning method, Co-Class can 
deal with two specific difficulties of the problem 
to produce more accurate classifiers. Our experi-
mental results show that Co-Class outperforms 
strong baselines including classifiers trained using 
labeled data in the target domains and classifiers 
from a state-of-the-art transfer learning method.
