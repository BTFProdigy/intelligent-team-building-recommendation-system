Abstract
This paper presents on-going work on
constructing bilingual multimodal corpora
of referring expressions in collaborative
problem solving for English and Japanese.
The corpora were collected from dia-
logues in which two participants collab-
oratively solved Tangram puzzles with
a puzzle simulator. Extra-linguistic in-
formation such as operations on puzzle
pieces, mouse cursor position and piece
positions were recorded in synchronisa-
tion with utterances. The speech data
was transcribed and time-aligned with the
extra-linguistic information. Referring
expressions in utterances that refer to puz-
zle pieces were annotated in terms of their
spans, their referents and their other at-
tributes. The Japanese corpus has already
been completed, but the English counter-
part is still undergoing annotation. We
have conducted a preliminary comparative
analysis of both corpora, mainly with re-
spect to task completion time, task suc-
cess rates and attributes of referring ex-
pressions. These corpora showed signif-
icant differences in task completion time
and success rate.
1 Introduction
A referring expression (RE) is a linguistic de-
vice that refers to a certain object of interest (e.g.
used in describing where the object is located in
space). REs have attracted a great deal of atten-
tion in both language analysis and language gen-
eration research. In language analysis research,
reference resolution, particularly anaphora resolu-
tion (Mitkov, 2002), has a long research history as
far back as the mid-1970s (Hobbs, 1978). Much
research has been conducted from both theoretical
and empirical perspectives, mainly concerning the
identification of antecedents or entities mentioned
within the same text. This trend, targeting refer-
ence resolution in written text, is still dominant in
the language analysis, perhaps because such tech-
niques are intended for use in applications such as
information extraction.
In contrast, in language generation research in-
terest has recently shifted from the generation of
one-off references to entities to generation of REs
in discourse context (Belz et al, 2010) and inves-
tigating human referential behaviour in real world
situations, with the aim of using such techniques
in applications like human-robot interaction (Pi-
wek, 2007; Foster et al, 2008; Bard et al, 2009).
In both analysis and generation, machine-
learning approaches have come to replace rule-
based approaches as the predominant research
trend since the 1990s. This trend has made anno-
tated corpora an indispensable component of re-
search for training and evaluating proposed meth-
ods. In fact, research on reference resolution has
developed significantly as a result of large scale
corpora, e.g. those provided by the Message Un-
derstanding Conference (MUC)1 and the Auto-
matic Content Extraction (ACE)2 project. These
corpora were constructed primarily for informa-
tion extraction research, thus were annotated with
co-reference relations within texts. Also in the
language generation community, several corpora
1http://www.nlpir.nist.gov/related projects/muc/
2http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/tests/ace/
38
have been developed (Di Eugenio et al, 2000; By-
ron, 2005; van Deemter et al, 2006; Foster and
Oberlander, 2007; Foster et al, 2008; Stoia et al,
2008; Spanger et al, 2009a; Belz et al, 2010).
Unlike the corpora of MUC and ACE, many are
collected from situated dialogues, and therefore
include multimodal information (e.g. gestures and
eye-gaze) other than just transcribed text (Martin
et al, 2007). Foster and Oberlander (2007) em-
phasised that any corpus for language generation
should include all possible contextual information
at the appropriate granularity. Since constructing
a dialogue corpus generally requires experiments
for data collection, this kind of corpus tends to be
small-scale compared with corpora for reference
resolution.
Against this background, we have been de-
veloping multimodal corpora of referring expres-
sions in collaborative problem-solving settings.
This paper presents on-going work of construct-
ing bilingual (English and Japanese) comparable
corpora in this domain. We achieve our goal by
replicating, for the English corpus, the same pro-
cess of data collection and annotation as we used
for our existing Japanese corpus (Spanger et al,
2009a). Our aim is to create bilingual multimodal
corpora collected from dialogues in dynamic situ-
ations. From the point of view of reference anal-
ysis, our corpora contribute to augmenting the re-
sources of multimodal dialogue corpora annotated
with reference relations which have been minor
in number compared to other types of text cor-
pora. From the point of view of reference gen-
eration, our corpora contribute to increasing the
resources available that can be used to further re-
search of this kind. In addition, our corpora con-
tribute to comparative studies of human referential
behaviour in different languages
The structure of the paper is as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the experimental set-up for data
collection which was introduced in our previous
work (Spanger et al, 2009a). The setting is basi-
cally the same for the construction of the English
corpus. Section 3 explains the annotation scheme
adopted in our corpora, followed by a description
of a preliminary analysis of the corpora in sec-
tion 4. Section 5 briefly mentions related work
to highlight the characteristics of our corpora. Fi-
nally, Section 6 concludes the paper and looks at
possible future directions.

2 Data collection
2.1 Experimental set-up
We recruited subjects in pairs of friends and col-
leagues. Each pair was instructed to solve Tan-
gram puzzles collaboratively. Tangram puzzles
are geometrical puzzles that originated in ancient
China. The goal of a Tangram puzzle is to con-
struct a given goal shape by arranging seven sim-
ple shapes, as shown in Figure 1. The pieces in-
clude two large triangles, a medium-sized trian-
gle, two small triangles, a parallelogram and a
square.
With the aim of recording the precise position
of every piece and every action the participants
made during the solving process, we implemented
a Tangram simulator in which the pieces can be
moved, rotated and flipped with simple mouse op-
erations on a computer display. The simulator dis-
plays two areas: a goal shape area and a work-
ing area where the pieces can be manupulated and
their movements are shown in real time.
We assigned a different role to each participant
of a pair: one acted as the solver and the other as
the operator. The operator has a mouse for manip-
ulating Tangram pieces, but does not have a goal
shape on the screen. The solver has a goal shape
on the screen but does not have a mouse. This set-
ting naturally leads to a situation where given a
certain goal shape, the solver thinks of the neces-
sary arrangement of the pieces and gives instruc-
tions to the operator how to move them, while the
operator manipulates the pieces with the mouse
39
according to the solver?s instructions.
Figure 2: Picture of the experiment setting
As we mentioned in our previous
study (Spanger et al, 2009a), this interaction
produces frequent use of referring expressions
intended to distinguish specific pieces of the
puzzle. In our Tangram simulator, all pieces
are of the same color, thus color is not useful
in identifying a specific piece, i.e. only size
and shape are discriminative object-intrinsic
attributes. Instead, we can expect other attributes
such as spatial relations and deictic reference to
be used more often.
Each pair of participants sat side by side as
shown in Figure 2. Each participant had his/her
own computer display showing the shared work-
ing area. A room-divider screen was set between
the solver (right side) and operator (left side) to
prevent the operator from seeing the goal shape on
the solver?s screen, and to restrict their interaction
to speech only.

Figure 3: The goal shapes given to the subjects
Each participant pair was assigned 4 trials con-
sisting of two symmetric and two asymmetric
goal shapes as shown in Figure 3. In Cogni-
tive Science, a wide variety of different kinds of
puzzles have been employed extensively in the
field of Insight Problem solving. This has been
termed the ?puzzle-problem approach? (Sternberg
and Davidson, 1996; Suzuki et al, 2001) and
in the case of physical puzzles has relatively of-
ten involved puzzle tasks of symmetric shapes
like the so-called T-puzzle, e.g. (Kiyokawa and
Nakazawa, 2006). In more recent work Tangram
puzzles have been used as a means to study var-
ious new aspects of human problem solving ap-
proaches, including collection of of eye-gaze in-
formation (Baran et al, 2007). In order to col-
lect data as broadly as possible in this context, we
set up puzzle-problems including both symmetri-
cal as well as asymmetrical ones as shown in Fig-
ure 3.
The participants exchanged their roles after two
trials, i.e. a participant first solves a symmetric and
then an asymmetric puzzle as the solver and then
does the same as the operator, and vice versa. The
order of the puzzle trials is the same for all pairs.
Before starting the first trial as the operator,
each participant had a short training exercise in
order to learn how to manipulate pieces with the
mouse. The initial arrangement of the pieces was
randomised every time. We set a time limit of 15
minutes for the completion of each trial (i.e. con-
struction of the goal shape). In order to prevent the
solver from getting into deep thought and keeping
silent, the simulator is designed to give a hint ev-
ery five minutes by showing a correct piece posi-
tion in the goal shape area. After 10 minutes have
passed, a second hint is provided, while the pre-
vious hint disappears. A trial ends when the goal
shape is complete or the time is up. Utterances by
the participants are recorded separately in stereo
through headset microphones in synchronisation
with the position of the pieces and the mouse op-
erations. Piece positions and mouse actions were
automatically recorded by the simulator at inter-
vals of 10 msec.

2.2 Subjects and collected data
For our Japanese corpus, we recruited 12 Japanese
graduate students of the Cognitive Science depart-
ment, 4 females and 8 males, and split them into 6
pairs. All pairs knew each other previously and
were of the same sex and approximately same
age3. We collected 24 dialogues (4 trials by 6
pairs) of about 4 hours and 16 minutes. The av-
erage length of a dialogue was 10 minutes 40 sec-
onds (SD = 3 minutes 18 seconds).
For the comparable English corpus, we re-
cruited 12 native English speakers of various oc-
cupations, 6 males and 6 females. Their aver-
age age was 30. There were 6 pairs all of whom
knew each other beforehand except for one pair.
Whereas during the creation of the Japanese cor-
pus we had to give extra attention to ensuring that
social relationships did not have an impact on how
the subjects communicated with one another, for
the English corpus there was no such concern. We
collected 24 dialogues (4 trials by 6 pairs) of 5
hours and 7 minutes total length. The average
length of a dialogue was 12 minutes 47 seconds
(SD = 3 minutes 34 seconds).
3 Annotation
The recorded speech data was transcribed and
the referring expressions were annotated with
the Web-based multi-purpose annotation tool
3In Japan, the relationship of senior to junior or socially
higher to lower placed might affect the language use. We
carefully recruited pairs to avoid the effects of this social re-
lationship such as the possible use of overly polite and indi-
rect language, reluctance to correct mistakes etc.
Table 2: Attributes of referring expressions
dpr : demonstrative pronoun, e.g. ?the same one?,
?this?, ?that?, ?it?
dad : demonstrative adjective, e.g. ?that triangle?
siz : size, e.g. ?the large triangle?
typ : type, e.g. ?the square?
dir : direction of a piece, e.g. ?the triangle facing the
left?.
prj : projective spatial relation (including directional
prepositions or nouns such as ?right?, ?left?,
?above?. . . ) e.g. ?the triangle to the left of the
square?
tpl : topological spatial relation (including non-
directional prepositions or nouns such as ?near?,
?middle?. . . ), e.g. ?the triangle near the square?
ovl : overlap, e.g. ?the small triangle under the large
one?
act : action on pieces, e.g ?the triangle that you are
holding now?, ?the triangle that you just rotated?
cmp : complement, e.g. ?the other one?
sim : similarity, e.g. ?the same one?
num : number, e.g. ?the two triangle?
rpr : repair, e.g. ?the big, no, small triangle?
err : obvious erroneous expression, e.g. ?the square?
referring to a triangle
nest : nested expression; when a referring expression
includes another referring expression, only the
outermost expression is annotated with this at-
tribute, e.g. ?(the triangle to the left of (the small
triangle))?
meta: metaphorical expression, e.g. ?the leg?, ?the
head?
SLAT (Noguchi et al, 2008)4. Our target expres-
sions in this corpus are referring expressions re-
ferring to a puzzle piece or a set of puzzle pieces.
We do not deal with expressions referring to a lo-
cation, a part of a piece or a constructed shape.
These expressions are put aside for future work.
The annotation of referring expressions is three-
fold: (1) identification of the span of expressions,
(2) identification of their referents, and (3) assign-
ment of a set of attributes to each referring expres-
sion.
Using the multimodal annotation tool ELAN,5
the annotations of referring expressions were then
merged with extra-linguistic data recorded by the
Tangram simulator. The available extra-linguistic
information from the simulator consists of (1) the
action on a piece, (2) the coordinates of the mouse
cursor and (3) the position of each piece in the
4We did not use SLAT for English corpus annotation. In-
stead, ELAN was directly used for annotating referring ex-
pressions.

working area. Actions and mouse cursor positions
are recorded at intervals of 10 msec, and are ab-
stracted into (1) a time span labeled with an action
symbol (?move?, ?rotate? or ?flip?) and its target
piece number (1?7), and (2) a time span labeled
with a piece number which is under the mouse
cursor during that span. The position of pieces is
updated and recorded with a timestamp when the
position of any piece changes. Information about
piece positions is not merged into the ELAN files
and is kept in separate files. As a result, we have
11 time-aligned ELAN Tiers as shown in Table 1.
Two annotators (two of the authors) first an-
notated four Japanese dialogues separately and
based on a discussion of discrepancies, decided
on the following criteria to identify a referring ex-
pression.
? The minimum span of a noun phrase in-
cluding necessary information to identify a
referent is annotated. The span might in-
clude repairs with their reparandum and dis-
fluency (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993) if
needed.
? Demonstrative adjectives are included in ex-
pressions.
? Erroneous expressions are annotated with a
special attribute.
? An expression without a definite referent (i.e.
a group of possible referents or none) is as-
signed a referent number sequence consist-
ing of a prefix, followed by the sequence of
possible referents as its referent, if any are
present.
? All expressions appearing in muttering to
oneself are excluded.
Table 2 shows a list of attributes of referring
expressions used in annotating the corpus.
The rest of the 20 Japanese dialogues were an-
notated by two of the authors and discrepancies
were resolved by discussion. Four English dia-
logues have been annotated so far by one of the
authors.
4 Preliminary corpus analysis
We have already completed the Japanese corpus,
which is named REX-J (2008-08), but only 4 out
of 24 dialogues have been annotated for the En-
glish counterpart (REX-E (2010-03)). Table 3
shows a summary of the trials. The horizontal
42
lines divide the trials by pairs, ?o? in the ?suc-
cess? column denotes that the trial was success-
fully completed in the time limit (15 minutes), and
the ?OP-REX? and ?SV-REX? columns show the
number of referring expressions used by the op-
erator and the solver respectively. The following
subsections describe a preliminary comparison of
the English and Japanese corpora.

(167.3) (168.5) (242.2) (215.2)
* Average (SD)
4.1 Task performance
We conducted a two-way ANOVA with the task
completion time as the dependent variable, and
the goal shape and the language as the indepen-
dent variables. Only the main effect of the lan-
guage was significant (F (1, 40) = 5.82, p <
0.05). Table 4 shows the average and the standard
deviation of the completion time. Note that we set
a time limit (15 minutes) for solving the puzzle.
We considered the completion time as 15 minutes
even when a puzzle was not actually solved in the
time limit. We also conducted a two-way ANOVA
using only the successful cases. Both main effects
and their interaction were not significant.
We then conducted an ANOVA with the num-
ber of successfully solved puzzles by each pair as
the dependent variable and the language as the in-
dependent variable. The main effect was signifi-
cant (F (1, 10) = 6.79, p < 0.05). Table 5 shows
the average number of success goals per pair and
the success rate with their standard deviations in
parentheses.
Finally, we conducted an ANOVA with the
number of pairs who succeeded in solving a goal

rates

shape as the dependent variable and the goal shape
as the independent variable. The main effect was
not significant.
In summary, we found a difference in the task
performance between the languages in terms of
the task completion time and the success rate, but
no difference among the goal shapes. This dif-
ference could be explained by the diversity of the
subjects rather than the difference of languages.
The Japanese subject group consisted of univer-
sity graduate students from the same department
(Cognitive Science) and roughly of the same age
(Average = 23.3, SD = 1.5). In contrast, the En-
glish subjects have diverse backgrounds (e.g. high
school students, university faculty, writer, pro-
grammer, etc.) and age (Average = 30.8, SD =
11.7). In addition, a familiarity with this kind of
geometric puzzle might have some effect. How-
ever, we collected a familiarity with the puzzle
only from the English subjects, we could not con-
duct further analysis on this viewpoint. Anyhow,
in this respect, the independent variable should
have been named ?subject group? instead of ?lan-
guage?.
4.2 Referring expressions
It is important to note that since we have only
completed the annotation of four dialogs, all by
one pair of subjects, our analyses of referring ex-
pressions are tentative and pending further analy-
sis.
We have 200 and 1,243 referring expressions by
the operator and the solver respectively, 1,444 in
total in the 24 Japanese dialogues. On the other
hand we have 26 (operator) and 315 (solver) re-
ferring expressions in 4 English dialogues. The
average number of referring expressions per di-
alogue in Table 3 suggests that English subjects
use more referring expressions than Japanese sub-
jects. Since we have only the data from a single
pair, we cannot say whether this tendency applies
to the other pairs. We cannot draw a decisive con-
clusion until we complete the annotation of the
English corpus.
Table 6 shows the total frequencies of the at-
tributes and their frequencies per dialogue. The
table gives us an impression of significantly fre-
quent use of demonstrative pronouns (dpr) by the

attributes of projective spatial relations (prj) and
actions on the referent (act).6 The English subjects
use more complement attributes (cmp) as well as
more number attributes (num).
5 Related work
Over the last decade, with a growing recogni-
tion that referring expressions frequently appear
in collaborative task dialogues (Clark and Wilkes-
Gibbs, 1986; Heeman and Hirst, 1995), a num-
ber of corpora have been constructed to study the
nature of their use. This tendency also reflects
the recognition that this area yields both challeng-
ing research topics as well as promising applica-
tions such as human-robot interaction (Foster et
al., 2008; Kruijff et al, 2010).
The COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al,
2000) was collected from keyboard-dialogs be-
tween two participants, who worked together on
a simple 2-D design task, buying and arranging
furniture for two rooms. The COCONUT cor-
pus is limited in annotations which describe sym-
bolic object information such as object intrinsic
attributes and location in discrete co-ordinates. As
an initial work of constructing a corpus for collab-
orative tasks, the COCONUT corpus can be char-
acterised as having a rather simple domain as well
6We called such expressions as action-mentioning expres-
sions (AME) in our previous work.
as limited annotation.
The QUAKE corpus (Byron, 2005) and its suc-
cessor, the SCARE corpus (Stoia et al, 2008) deal
with a more complex domain, where two partici-
pants collaboratively play a treasure hunting game
in a 3-D virtual world. Despite the complexity
of the domain, the participants were only allowed
limited actions, e.g. moving step forward, pushing
a button etc.
As a part of the JAST project, the Joint Con-
struction Task (JCT) corpus was created based on
dialogues in which two participants constructed a
puzzle (Foster et al, 2008). The setting of the
experiment is quite similar to ours except that
both participants have even roles. Since our main
concern is referring expressions, we believe our
asymmetric setting elicits more referring expres-
sions than the symmetric setting of the JCT cor-
pus.
In contrast to these previous corpora, our cor-
pora record a wide range of information useful
for analysis of human reference behaviour in situ-
ated dialogue. While the domain of our corpora is
simple compared to the QUAKE and SCARE cor-
pora, we allowed a comparatively large flexibil-
ity in the actions necessary for achieving the goal
shape (i.e. flipping, turning and moving of puzzle
pieces at different degrees), relative to the com-
plexity of the domain. Providing this relatively
larger freedom of actions to the participants to-
gether with the recording of detailed information
allows for research into new aspects of referring
expressions.
As for a multilingual aspect, all the above cor-
pora are English. There have been several recent
attempts at collecting multilingual corpora in situ-
ated domains. For instance, (Gargett et al, 2010)
collected German and English corpora in the same
setting. Their domain is similar to the QUAKE
corpus. Van der Sluis et al (2009) aim at a com-
parative study of referring expressions between
English and Japanese. Their domain is still static
at the moment. Our corpora aim at dealing with
the dynamic nature of situated dialogues between
very different languages, English and Japanese.

6 Conclusion and future work
This paper presented an overview of our English-
Japanese bilingual multimodal corpora of refer-
ring expressions in a collaborative problem solv-
ing setting. The Japanese corpus was completed
and has already been used for research (Spanger et
al., 2009b; Spanger et al, 2010; Iida et al, 2010),
but the English counterpart is still undergoing an-
notation. We have also presented a preliminary
comparative analysis of these corpora in terms of
the task performance and usage of referring ex-
pressions. We found a significant difference of the
task performance, which could be attributed to the
difference in diversity of subjects. We have tenta-
tive results on the usage of referring expressions,
since only four English dialogues are available at
the moment.
The data collection experiments were con-
ducted in August 2008 for Japanese and in March
2010 for English. Between these periods, we
conducted various data collections to build differ-
ent types of Japanese corpora (March, 2009 and
November 2009). These experiments involve cap-
turing eye-gaze information of participants during
problem solving, and introducing variants of puz-
zles (Polyomino, Double Tangram and Tangram
without any hints7). They are also under prepa-
ration for publication. Table 7 gives an overview
of the REX-J corpus family, where ?#valid? de-
notes the number of dialogues with valid eye-
gaze data. Eye-gaze data is difficult to capture
cleanly throughout a dialogue. We discarded di-
alogues in which eye-gaze was captured success-
fully less than 70% of the total time of the dia-
logue. Namely, we annotated or will annotate di-
alogues with validated eye-gaze data only.
These corpora enable research on utilising eye-
gaze information in reference resolution and gen-
7N2009-11 in Table 7
eration, and evaluation in different tasks (puzzles)
as well. We are planning to distribute the REX-J
corpus family through GSK (Language Resources
Association in Japan)8, and the REX-E corpus
from both University of Brighton and GSK.

Abstract
In the field of referring expression gener-
ation, while in the static domain both in-
trinsic and extrinsic evaluations have been
considered, extrinsic evaluation in the dy-
namic domain, such as in a situated col-
laborative dialog, has not been discussed
in depth. In a dynamic domain, a cru-
cial problem is that referring expressions
do not make sense without an appropriate
preceding dialog context. It is unrealistic
for an evaluation to simply show a human
evaluator the whole period from the be-
ginning of a dialog up to the time point
at which a referring expression is used.
Hence, to make evaluation feasible it is
indispensable to determine an appropriate
shorter context. In order to investigate the
context necessary to understand a referring
expression in a situated collaborative dia-
log, we carried out an experiment with 33
evaluators and a Japanese referring expres-
sion corpus. The results contribute to find-
ing the proper contexts for extrinsic evalu-
tion in dynamic domains.
1 Introduction
In recent years, the NLG community has paid sig-
nificant attention to the task of generating referring
expressions, reflected in the seting-up of several
competitive events such as the TUNA and GIVE-
Challenges at ENLG 2009 (Gatt et al, 2009; By-
ron et al, 2009).
With the development of increasingly complex
generation systems, there has been heightened in-
terest in and an ongoing significant discussion on
different evaluation measures for referring expres-
sions. This discussion is carried out broadly in the
field of generation, including in the multi-modal
domain, e.g. (Stent et al, 2005; Foster, 2008).

Figure 1: Overview of recent work on evaluation
of referring expressions
Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of recent
work on evaluation of referring expressions along
the two axes of evaluation method and domain in
which referring expressions are used.
There are two different evaluation methods cor-
responding to the bottom and the top of the verti-
cal axis in Figure 1: intrinsic and extrinsic eval-
uations (Sparck Jones and Galliers, 1996). In-
trinsic methods often measure similarity between
the system output and the gold standard corpora
using metrics such as tree similarity, string-edit-
distance and BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002). Intrin-
sic methods have recently become popular in the
NLG community. In contrast, extrinsic methods
evaluate generated expressions based on an exter-
nal metric, such as its impact on human task per-
formance.
While intrinsic evaluations have been widely
used in NLG, e.g. (Reiter et al, 2005), (Cahill
and van Genabith, 2006) and the competitive 2009
TUNA-Challenge, there have been a number of
criticisms against this type of evaluation. (Reiter
and Sripada, 2002) argue, for example, that gener-
ated text might be very different from a corpus but
still achieve the specific communicative goal.
An additional problem is that corpus-similarity
metrics measure how well a system reproduces
what speakers (or writers) do, while for most NLG
systems ultimately the most important considera-
tion is its effect on the human user (i.e. listener
or reader). Thus (Khan et al, 2009) argues that
?measuring human-likeness disregards effective-
ness of these expressions?.
Furthermore, as (Belz and Gatt, 2008) state
?there are no significant correlations between in-
trinsic and extrinsic evaluation measures?, con-
cluding that ?similarity to human-produced refer-
ence texts is not necessarily indicative of quality
as measured by human task performance?.
From early on in the NLG community, task-
based extrinsic evaluations have been considered
as the most meaningful evaluation, especially
when having to convince people in other commu-
nities of the usefulness of a system (Reiter and
Belz, 2009). Task performance evaluation is rec-
ognized as the ?only known way to measure the ef-
fectiveness of NLG systems with real users? (Re-
iter et al, 2003). Following this direction, the
GIVE-Challenges (Koller et al, 2009) at INLG
2010 (instruction generation) also include a task-
performance evaluation.
In contrast to the vertical axis of Figure 1, there
is the horizontal axis of the domain in which refer-
ring expressions are used. Referring expressions
can thus be distinguished according to whether
they are used in a static or a dynamic domain, cor-
responding to the left and right of the horizontal
axis of Figure 1. A static domain is one such as the
TUNA corpus (van Deemter, 2007), which col-
lects referring expressions based on a motionless
image. In contrast, a dynamic domain comprises a
constantly changing situation where humans need
context information to identify the referent of a re-
ferring expression.
Referring expressions in the static domain have
been evaluated relatively extensively. A recent ex-
ample of an intrinsic evaluation is (van der Sluis
et al, 2007), who employed the Dice-coefficient
measuring corpus-similarity. There have been a
number of extrinsic evaluations as well, such as
(Paraboni et al, 2006) and (Khan et al, 2009), re-
spectively measuring the effect of overspecifica-
tion on task performance and the impact of gener-
ated text on accuracy as well as processing speed.
They belong thus in the top-left quadrant of Fig-
ure 1.
Over a recent period, research in the generation
of referring expressions has moved to dynamic do-
mains such as situated dialog, e.g. (Jordan and
Walker, 2005) and (Stoia et al, 2006). However,
both of them carried out an intrinsic evaluation
measuring corpus-similarity or asking evaluators
to compare system output to expressions used by
human (the right bottom quadrant in Figure 1).
The construction of effective generation sys-
tems in the dynamic domain requires the imple-
mentation of an extrinsic task performance evalu-
ation. There has been work on extrinsic evalua-
tion of instructions in the dynamic domain on the
GIVE-2 challenge (Byron et al, 2009), which is a
task to generate instructions in a virtual world. It is
based on the GIVE-corpus (Gargett et al, 2010),
which is collected through keyboard interaction.
The evaluation measures used are e.g. the number
of successfully completed trials, completion time
as well as the numbers of instructions the system
sent to the user. As part of the JAST project, a
Joint Construction Task (JCT) puzzle construction
corpus (Foster et al, 2008) was created which is
similar in some ways in its set-up to the REX-
J corpus which we use in the current research.
There has been some work on evaluating gener-
ation strategies of instructions for a collaborative
construction task on this corpus, both considering
intrinsic as well as extrinsic measures (Foster et
al., 2009). Their main concern is, however, the in-
teraction between the text structure and usage of
referring expressions. Therefore, their ?context?
was given a priori.
However, as can be seen from Figure 1, in the
field of referring expression generation, while in
the static domain both intrinsic and extrinsic eval-
uations have been considered, the question of re-
alizing an extrinsic evaluation in the dynamic do-
main has not been dealt with in depth by previous
work. This paper addresses this shortcoming of
previous work and contributes to ?filling in? the
missing quadrant of Figure 1 (the top-right).
The realization of such an extrinsic evaluation
faces one key difficulty. In a static domain, an ex-
trinsic evaluation can be realized relatively easily
by showing evaluators the static context (e.g. any
image) and a referring expression, even though
this is still costly in comparison to intrinsic meth-
ods (Belz and Gatt, 2008).
In contrast, an extrinsic evaluation in the dy-
namic domain needs to present an evaluator with
the dynamic context (e.g. a certain length of the
recorded dialog) preceding a referring expression.
It is clearly not feasible to simply show the whole
preceding dialog; this would make even a very
small-scale evaluation much too costly. Thus, in
order to realize a cost-effective extrinsic evalua-
tion in a dynamic domain we have to deal with the
additional parameter of time length and content of
the context shown to evaluators.
This paper investigates the context necessary for
humans to understand different types of referring
expressions in a situated domain. This work thus
charts new territory and contributes to developing
a extrinsic evaluation in a dynamic domain. Sig-
nificantly, we consider not only linguistic but also
extra-linguistic information as part of the context,
such as the actions that have been carried out in the
preceding interaction. Our results indicate that, at
least in this domain, extrinsic evaluation results
in dynamic domains can depend on the specific
amount of context shown to the evaluator. Based
on the results from our evaluation experiments, we
discuss the broader conclusions to be drawn and
directions for future work.
2 Referring Expressions in the REX-J
Corpus
We utilize the REX-J corpus, a Japanese corpus
of referring expressions in a situated collaborative
task (Spanger et al, 2009a). It was collected by
recording the interaction of a pair of dialog partic-
ipants solving the Tangram puzzle cooperatively.
The goal of the Tangram puzzle is to construct a
given shape by arranging seven pieces of simple
figures as shown in Figure 2
!"#$%&'#()
*"+,-.!%#+)#
Figure 2: Screenshot of the Tangram simulator
In order to record the precise position of every
piece and every action by the participants, we im-
plemented a simulator. The simulator displays two
areas: a goal shape area, and a working area where
pieces are shown and can be manipulated.
We assigned different roles to the two partici-
pants of a pair: solver and operator. The solver
can see the goal shape but cannot manipulate the
pieces and hence gives instructions to the opera-
tor; by contrast, the operator can manipulate the
pieces but can not see the goal shape. The two
participants collaboratively solve the puzzle shar-
ing the working area in Figure 2.
In contrast to other recent corpora of refer-
ring expressions in situated collaborative tasks
(e.g. COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al, 2000)
and SCARE corpora (Byron et al, 2005)), in
the REX-J corpus we allowed comparatively large
real-world flexibility in the actions necessary to
achieve the task (such as flipping, turning and
moving of puzzle pieces at different degrees), rel-
ative to the task complexity. The REX-J corpus
thus allows us to investigate the interaction of lin-
guistic and extra-linguistic information. Interest-
ingly, the GIVE-2 challenge at INLG 2010 notes
its ?main novelty? is allowing ?continuous moves
rather than discrete steps as in GIVE-1?. Our work
is in line with the broader research trend in the
NLG community of trying to get away from sim-
ple ?discrete? worlds to more realistic settings.
The REX-J corpus contains a total of 1,444 to-
kens of referring expressions in 24 dialogs with a
total time of about 4 hours and 17 minutes. The
average length of each dialog is 10 minutes 43
seconds. The asymmetric data-collection setting
encouraged referring expressions from the solver
(solver: 1,244 tokens, operator: 200 tokens). We
exclude from consideration 203 expressions refer-
ring to either groups of pieces or whose referent
cannot be determined due to ambiguity, thus leav-
ing us 1,241 expressions.
We identified syntactic/semantic features in the
collected referring expressions as listed in Table 1:
(a) demonstratives (adjectives and pronouns), (b)
object attribute-values, (c) spatial relations and (d)
actions on an object. The underlined part of the
examples denotes the feature in question.
3 Design of Evaluation Experiment
The aim of our experiment is to investigate the
?context? (content of the time span of the recorded
Table 1: Syntactic and semantic features of refer-
ring expressions in the REX-J corpus

(a) demonstrative 742 ano migigawa no sankakkei

(b) attribute 795 tittyai sankakkei

(the small triangle on the left)
(d) action-mentioning 85 migi ue ni doketa sankakkei
(the triangle you put away to

interaction prior to the uttering of the referring ex-
pression) necessary to enable successful identifi-
cation of the referent of a referring expression.
Our method is to vary the context presented to
evaluators and then to study the impact on human
referent identification. In order to realize this, for
each instance of a referring expression, we vary
the length of the video shown to the evaluator.

Figure 3: The interface presented to evaluators
The basic procedure of our evaluation experi-
ment is as follows:
(1) present human evaluators with speech and
video from a dialog that captures shared
working area of a certain length previous to
the uttering of a referring expression,
(2) stop the video and display as text the next
solver?s utterance including the referring ex-
pression (shown in red),
(3) ask the evaluator to identify the referent
of the presented referring expression (if the
evaluator wishes, he/she can replay the video
as many times as he likes),
(4) proceed to the next referring expression (go
to (1)).
Figure 3 shows a screenshot of the interface pre-
pared for this experiment.
The test data consists of three types of referring
expressions: DPs (demonstrative pronouns),
AMEs (action-mentioning expressions), and
OTHERs (any other expression that is neither a
DP nor AME, e.g intrinsic attributes and spatial
relations). DPs are the most frequent type of
referring expression in the corpus. AMEs are
expressions that utilize an action on the referent
such as ?the triangle you put away to the top
right? (see Table 1)1. As we pointed out in our
previous paper (Spanger et al, 2009a), they are
also a fundamental type of referring expression in
this domain.
The basic question in investigating a suitable
context is what information to consider about the
preceding interaction; i.e. over what parameters to
vary the context. In previous work on the gener-
ation of demonstrative pronouns in a situated do-
main (Spanger et al, 2009b), we investigated the
role of linguistic and extra-linguistic information,
and found that time distance from the last action
(LA) on the referent as well as the last mention
(LM) to the referent had a significant influence on
the usage of referring expressions. Based on those
results, we focus on the information on the refer-
ent, namely LA and LM.
For both AMEs and OTHERs, we only consider
two possibilities of the order in which LM and LA
appear before a referring expression (REX), de-
pending on which comes first. These are shown in
Figure 4, context patterns (a) LA-LM and (b) LM-
LA. Towards the very beginning of a dialog, some
referring expressions have no LM and LA; those
expressions are not considered in this research.
All instances of AMEs and OTHERs in our test
data belong to either the LA-LM or the LM-LA
1An action on the referent is usually described by a verb
as in this example. However, there are cases with a verb el-
lipsis. While this would be difficult in English, it is natural
and grammatical in Japanese.

pattern. For each of these two context patterns,
there are three possible contexts2: Both (including
both LA and LM), LA/LM (including either LA or
LM) and None (including neither). Depending on
the order of LA and LM prior to an expression,
only one of the variations of LA/LM is possible
(see Figure 4 (a) and (b)).
In contrast, DPs tend to be utilized in a deic-
tic way in such situated dialogs (Piwek, 2007).
We further noted in (Spanger et al, 2009b), that
DPs in a collaborative task are also frequently used
when the referent is under operation. While they
belong neither to the LA-LM nor the LM-LA pat-
tern, it would be inappropriate to exclude those
cases. Hence, for DPs we consider another situa-
tion where the last action on the referent overlaps
with the utterance of the DP (Figure 4 (c) LM-LA?
pattern). In this case, we consider an ongoing op-
eration on the referent as a ?last action?. Another
peculiarity of the LM-LA? pattern is that we have
no None context in this case, since there is no way
to show a video without showing LA (the current
operation).
Given the three basic variations of context, we
recruited 33 university students as evaluators and

contexts as shown in Figure 4.

evaluators per group. As for the referring ex-
pressions to evaluate, we selected 60 referring ex-
pressions used by the solver from the REX-J cor-
pus (20 from each category), ensuring all were
correctly understood by the operator during the
recorded dialog. We selected those 60 instances
from expressions where both LM and LA ap-
peared within the last 30 secs previous to the re-
ferring expression. This selection excludes initial
mentions, as well as expressions where only LA
or only LM exists or they do not appear within 30
secs. Hence the data utilized for this experiment
is limited in this sense. We need further experi-
ments to investigate the relation between the time
length of contexts and the accuarcy of evaluators.
We will return to this issue in the conclusion.
We combined 60 referring expressions and the
three contexts to make the test instances. Follow-
ing the Latin square design, we divided these test
instances into three groups, distributing each of
the three contexts for every referring expression
to each group. The number of contexts was uni-
formly distributed over the groups. Each instance
group was assigned to each evaluator group.
For each referring expression instance, we
record whether the evaluator was able to correctly
identify the referent, how long it took them to
identify it and whether they repeated the video
(and if so how many times).
Reflecting the distribution of the data available
in our corpus, the number of instances per context
pattern differs for each type of referring expres-
sion. For AMEs, overwhelmingly the last action
on the referent was more recent than the last men-
tion. Hence we have only two LA-LM patterns
among the 20 AMEs in our data. For OTHERs, the
balance is 8 to 12, with a slight majority of LM-
LA patterns. For DPs, there is a strong tendency to
use a DP when a piece is under operation (Spanger
et al, 2009b). Of the 20 DPs in the data, 2 were
LA-LM, 5 were LM-LA pattern while 13 were of
the LM-LA? pattern (i.e. their referents were under
operation at the time of the utterance). For these
13 instances of LM-LA? we do not have a None
context.
The average stimulus times, i.e. time period of
presented context, were 7.48 secs for None, 11.04
secs for LM/LA and 18.10 secs for Both.

4 Results and Analysis
In this section we discuss the results of our evalua-
tion experiment. In total 33 evaluators participated
in our experiment, each solving 60 problems of
referent identification. Taking into account the ab-
sence of the None context for the DPs of the LM-
LA? pattern (see (c) in Figure 4), we have 1,815
responses to analyze. We focus on the impact of
the three contexts on the three types of referring
expressions, considering the two context patterns
LA-MA and LM-LA.
4.1 Overview of Results
Table 2 shows the micro averages of the accura-
cies of referent identification of all evaluators over
different types of referring expressions with differ-
ent contexts. Accuracies increase with an increase
in the amount of information in the context; from
None to Both by between 13.2% (OTHERs) and
35.9% (AMEs). The average increase of accuracy
is 27.4%.
Overall, for AMEs the impact of the context is
the greatest, while for OTHERs it is the smallest.
This is not surprising given that OTHERs tend to
include intrinsic attributes of the piece and its spa-
tial relations, which are independent of the pre-
ceding context. We conducted ANOVA with the
context as the independent variable, testing its ef-
fect on identification accuracy. The main effect
of the context was significant on accuracy with
F (2, 1320) = 9.17, p < 0.01. Given that for
DPs we did not have an even distribution between
contexts, we only utilized the results of AMEs and
OTHERs.
There are differences between expression types
in terms of the impact of addition of LM/LA into
the context, which underlines that when studying
context, the relative role and contribution of LA
and LM (and their interaction) must be looked at in
detail for different types of referring expressions.
Over all referring expressions, the addition into
a None context of LM yields an average increase
in accuracy of 9.1% for all referring expression
types, while for the same conditions the addition
of LA yields an average increase of 21.3%. Hence,
interestingly for our test data, the addition of LA
to the context has a positive impact on accuracy by
more than two times over the addition of LM.
It is also notable that even with neither LA nor
LM present (i.e. the None context), the evaluators
were still able to correctly identify referents in be-
tween 50?68.6% (average: 62.9%) of the cases.
While this accuracy would be insufficient for the
evaluation of machine generated referring expres-
sions, it is still higher than one might expect and
further investigation of this case is necessary.
4.2 Demonstrative Pronouns
For DPs, there is a very clear difference between
the two patterns (LM-LA and LA-LM) in terms of
the increase of accuracy with a change of context.
While accuracy for the LA-LM pattern remains at
a high level (over 90%) for all three contexts (and
there is only a very small increase from None to
Both), for the LM-LA pattern there is a strong in-
crease from None to Both of 38.8%.
The difference in accuracy between the two
context patterns of DPs in the None context might
come from the mouse cursor effect. The two ex-
pressions of LA-LM pattern happened to have a
mouse cursor on the referent, when they were
used, resulting in high accuracy. On the other
hand, 4 out of 5 expressions of LM-LA pattern did
not have a mouse cursor on the referent. We have
currently no explanation for the relation between
context patterns and the mouse position. While
we have only 7 expressions in the None context
for DPs and hence cannot draw any decisive con-
clusions, we note that the impact of the mouse po-
sition is a likely factor.
For the LM-LA pattern, there is an increase
in accuracy of 32.8% from None to the LA-
context. Overwhelmingly, this represents in-
stances in which the referents are being operated
at the point in time when the solver utters a DP
(this is in fact the LM-LA? pattern, which has no
None context). For those instances, the current
operation information is sufficient to identify the
referents. In contrast, addition of LM leads only
to a small increase in accuracy of 5.6%. This re-
sult is in accordance with our previous work on the
generation of DPs, which stressed the importance
of extra-linguistic information in the framework of
considering the interaction between linguistic and
extra-linguistic information.
4.3 Action-mentioning Expressions
While for AMEs the number of instances is very
uneven between patterns (similar to the distribu-
tion for DPs), there is a strong increase in accuracy
from the None context to the Both context for both
patterns (between 30% to almost 50%). However,
there is a difference between the two patterns in
terms of the relative contribution of LM and LA to
this increase.
While for the LA-LM pattern the impact of
adding LM and LA is very similar, for the LM-LA
pattern the major increase in accuracy is due to
adding LA into the None context. This indicates
that for AMEs, LA has a stronger impact on ac-
curacy than LM, as is to be expected. The strong
increase for AMEs of the LM-LA pattern when
adding LA into the context is not surprising, given
that the evaluators were able to see the action men-
tioned in the AME.
For the opposite reason, it is not surprising that
AMEs show the lowest accuracy in the None con-
text, given that the last action on the referent is
not seen by the evaluators. However, accuracy
was still slightly over 50% in the LM-LA pattern.
Overall, of the 18 instances of AMEs of the LM-
LA pattern, in the None context a majority of eval-
uators correctly identified 9 and erred on the other
9. Further analysis of the difference between cor-
rectly and incorrectly identified AMEs led us to
note again the important role of the mouse cursor
also for AMEs.
Comparing to the LM-LA pattern, we had very
low accuracy even with the Both context. As we
mentioned in the previous section, we had very
skewed test instances for AME, i.e. 18 LM-LA
patterns vs. 2 LA-LM patterns. We need further
investigation on the LA-LM pattern of AME with
more large number of instances.
Of the 18 LM-LA instances of AMEs, there are
14 instances that mention a verb describing an ac-
tion on the referent. The referents of 6 of those
14 AMEs were correctly determined by the evalu-
ators and in all cases the mouse cursor played an
important role in enabling the evaluator to deter-
mine the referent. The evaluators seem to utilize
the mouse position at the time of the uttering of the
referring expression as well as mouse movements
in the video shown. In contrast, for 8 out of the
9 incorrectly determined AMEs no such informa-
tion from the mouse was available. There was a
very similar pattern for AMEs that did not include
a verb. These points indicate that movements and
the position of the mouse both during the video as
well as the time point of the uttering of the refer-
ring expression give important clues to evaluators.
4.4 Other Expressions
There is a relatively even gain in identification ac-
curacy from None to Both of between about 10?
15% for both patterns. However, there is a simi-
lar tendency as for AMEs, since there is a differ-
ence between the two patterns in terms of the rel-
ative contribution of LM and LA to this increase.
While for the LA-LM pattern the impact of adding
LM and LA is roughly equivalent, for the LM-LA
pattern the major increase in accuracy is due to
adding LM into the LA-context.
For this pattern of OTHERs, LM has a stronger
impact on accuracy than LA, which is exactly the
opposite tendency to AMEs. For OTHERs (e.g.
use of attributes for object identification), seeing
the last action on the target has a less positive im-
pact than listening to the last linguistic mention.
Furthermore, we note the relatively high accuracy
in the None context for OTHERs, underlining the
context-independence of expressions utilizing at-
tributes and spatial relations of the pieces.
4.5 Error Analysis
We analyzed those instances whose referents were
not correctly identified by a majority of evalua-
tors in the Both context. Among the three expres-
sion types, there were about 13?16% of wrong an-
swers. In total for 7 of the 60 expressions a ma-
jority of evaluators gave wrong answers (4 DPs, 2
AMEs and 1 OTHER). Analysis of these instances
indicates that some improvements of our concep-
tion of ?context? is needed.
For 3 out of the 4 DPs, the mouse was not over
the referent or was closer to another piece. In addi-
tion, these DPs included expressions that pointed
to the role of a piece in the overall construction of
the goal shape, e.g. ?soitu ga atama (that is the
head)?, or where a DP is used as part of a more
complex referring expression, e.g. ?sore to onazi
katati . . . (the same shape as this)?, intended to
identify a different piece. For a non-participant
of the task, such expressions might be difficult to
understand in any context. This phenomenon is
related to the ?overhearer-effect? (Schober et al,
1989).
The two AMEs that the majority of evaluators
failed to identify in the Both context were also
misidentified in the LA context. Both AMEs were
missing a verb describing an action on the referent.
While for AMEs including a verb the accuracy in-
creased from None to Both by 50%, for AMEs
without a verb there was an increase by slightly
over 30%, indicating that in the case where an
AME lacks a verb, the context has a smaller pos-
itive impact on accuracy than for AMEs that in-
clude a verb. In order to account for those cases,
further work is necessary, such as investigating
how to account for the information on the distrac-
tors.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
In order to address the task of designing a flexi-
ble experiment set-up with relatively low cost for
extrinsic evaluations of referring expressions, we
investigated the context that needs to be shown to
evaluators in order to correctly determine the ref-
erent of an expression.
The analysis of our results showed that the con-
text had a significant impact on referent identifi-
cation. The impact was strongest for AMEs and
DPs and less so for OTHERs. Interestingly, we
found for both DPs and AMEs that including LA
in the context had a stronger positive impact than
including LM. This emphasizes the importance of
taking into account extra-linguistic information in
a situated domain, as considered in this study.
Our analysis of those expressions whose refer-
ent was incorrectly identified in the Both context
indicated some directions for improving the ?con-
text? used in our experiments, for example look-
ing further into AMEs without a verb describing
an action on the referent. Generally, there is a
necessity to account for mouse movements during
the video shown to evaluators as well as the prob-
lem for extrinsic evaluations of how to address the
?overhearer?s effect?.
While likely differing in the specifics of the set-
up, the methodology in the experiment design dis-
cussed in this paper is applicable to other domains,
in that it allows a low-cost flexible design of eval-
uating referring expressions in a dynamic domain.
In order to avoid the additional effort of analyzing
cases in relation to LM and LA, in the future it will
be desirable to simply set a certain time period and
base an evaluation on such a set-up.
However, we cannot simply assume that a
longer context would yield a higher identification
accuracy, given that evaluators in our set-up are
not actively participating in the interaction. Thus
there is a possibility that identification accuracy
actually decreases with longer video segments,
due to a loss of the evaluator?s concentration. Fur-
ther investigation of this question is indicated.
Based on the work reported in this paper, we
plan to implement an extrinsic task-performance
evaluation in the dynamic domain. Even with
the large potential cost-savings based on the re-
sults reported in this paper, extrinsic evaluations
will remain costly. Thus one important future task
for extrinsic evaluations will be to investigate the
correlation between extrinsic and intrinsic evalua-
tion metrics. This in turn will enable the use of
cost-effective intrinsic evaluations whose results
are strongly correlated to task-performance eval-
uations. This paper made an important contribu-
tion by pointing the direction for further research
in extrinsic evaluations in the dynamic domain.
