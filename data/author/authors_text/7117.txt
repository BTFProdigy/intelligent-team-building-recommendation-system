Abstract 
In this paper we describe the analytic 
question answering system HITIQA (High-
Quality Interactive Question Answering) 
which has been developed over the last 2 years 
as an advanced research tool for information 
analysts. HITIQA is an interactive open-
domain question answering technology 
designed to allow analysts to pose complex 
exploratory questions in natural language and 
obtain relevant information units to prepare 
their briefing reports. The system uses novel 
data-driven semantics to conduct a 
clarification dialogue with the user that 
explores the scope and the context of the 
desired answer space. The system has 
undergone extensive hands-on evaluations by 
a group of intelligence analysts. This 
evaluation validated the overall approach in 
HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the 
current prototype.  
1 Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as 
?What has been Russia?s reaction to the U.S. 
bombing of Kosovo?? The distinguishing property 
of such questions is that one cannot generally 
anticipate what might constitute the answer. While 
certain types of things may be expected (e.g., 
diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily 
conditioned by what information is in fact 
available on the topic. From a practical viewpoint, 
analytical questions are often underspecified, thus 
casting a broad net on a space of possible answers. 
Questions posed by professional analysts are 
aimed to probe the available data along certain 
dimensions. The results of these probes determine 
follow up questions, if necessary. Furthermore, at 
any stage clarifications may be needed to adjust 
the scope and intent of each question. Figure 1 
shows a fragment of an analytical session with 
HITIQA; note that these questions are not aimed at 
factoids, despite their simple form. 
User: What is the history of the nuclear arms 
program linking Iraq and other countries in the 
region? 
HITIQA: [responses and clarifications] 
User: Who financed the nuclear arms program 
in Iraq? 
HITIQA:? 
User: Has Iraq been able to import uranium? 
HITIQA:? 
User: What type of debt does exist between Iraq 
and her trading partners in the region? 
FIGURE 1: A fragment of an analyst?s session 
with HITIQA 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in 
the state of the art of automated question 
answering.  In this paper we focus on three aspects 
of our work: 
1. Question Semantics: how the system 
?understands? user requests 
2. Human-Computer Dialogue: how the user and 
the system negotiate this understanding 
3. User Evaluations and Results 
2 Factoid vs. Analytical QA 
There are significant differences between 
factoid, or fact-finding, and analytical question 
answering.  A factoid question is normally 
understood to seek a piece of information that 
would make a corresponding statement true (i.e., it 
becomes a fact): ?How many states are in the 
U.S.?? / ?There are X states in the U.S.? In this 
sense, a factoid question usually has just one 
correct answer that can generally be judged for its 
truthfulness with respect to some information 
source.  
As noted by Harabagiu et al (1999), factoid 
questions display a distinctive ?answer type?, 
which is the type of the information item needed 
for the answer, e.g., ?person? or ?country?, etc. 
Most existing factoid QA systems deduct this 
expected answer type from the form of the 
question using a finite list of possible answer 
types. For example, ?Who was the first man in 
space? expects a ?person? as the answer type. This 
is generally a very good strategy that has been 
exploited successfully in a number of automated 
QA systems, especially in the context of TREC 
QA1 evaluations. Given the excellent results posted 
by the best systems and an adequate performance 
attained even by some entry-level system, we 
believe that the process of factoid question 
answering is now fairly well understood 
(Harabagiu et al, 2002; Hovy et al, 2000; Prager 
at al., 2001, Wu et al, 2003). 
   In contrast to a factoid question, an analytical 
question has a virtually unlimited variety of 
syntactic forms with only a loose connection 
between their syntax and the expected answer. 
Given the many possible forms of analytical 
questions, it would be counter-productive to 
restrict them to a predefined number of 
question/answer types. Therefore, the formation of 
an answer in analytical QA should instead be 
guided by the user?s intended interest expressed in 
the question, as well as through any follow up 
dialogue with the system. This clearly involves 
user's intentions (the speech acts) and how they 
evolve with respect to the overall information 
strategy they are pursuing. 
In this paper we argue that the semantics 
(though not necessarily the intent) of an analytical 
question is more likely to be deduced from the 
information that is considered relevant to the 
question than through a detailed analysis of its 
particular form. We noted that the questions 
analysts ask, while clearly part of a strategy, are 
generally quite flexible and ?forgiving?, in the 
sense that there is always a strong possibility that 
the answer may not arrive in the expected form, 
and thus a change of strategy, and even the initial 
expectations, may be warranted. This suggests 
strongly that a solution to analytic QA must 
involve a dialogue that combines information 
seeking and problem solving strategies. 
3 Document Retrieval 
HITIQA works with unstructured text data, 
which means that a document retrieval step is 
required to detect any information that may be 
relevant to the user question. It has to be noted that 
determining ?relevant? information is not the same 
as finding an answer; indeed we can use relatively 
simple information retrieval methods (keyword 
matching, etc.) to obtain perhaps 200 ?relevant? 
                                                     
1 TREC QA is the annual Question Answering evaluation 
sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology 
www.trec.nist.gov 
documents from a database. This gives us an initial 
information space to work on in order to determine 
the scope and complexity of the answer, but we are 
nowhere near the answer yet. The current version 
of HITIQA uses the INQUERY system (Callan et 
al., 1992), although we have also used SMART 
(Buckley, 1985) and other IR systems (such as 
Google).   
4 Text Framing 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to 
delineate the gap between the possible meaning of 
the user?s question and the system ?understanding? 
of this question. We can approximate the meaning 
of the question by extracting references to known 
concepts in it, including named entities. The 
information retrieved from the database may well 
lead to other interpretations of the question, and we 
need to determine which of these are ?correct?.  
The framing process imposes a partial structure 
on the text passages that allows the system to 
systematically compare different passages against 
each other and against the question. Framing is not 
attempting to capture the entire meaning of the 
passage; it needs to be just sufficient enough to 
communicate with the user about the differences in 
their question and the returned text. In particular, 
the framing process may uncover topics or aspects 
within the answer space which the user has not 
explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of 
their existence. If these topics or aspects align 
closely with the user?s question, (i.e., matching 
many of the salient attributes) we may want to 
make the user aware of them and let him/her 
decide if they should be included in the answer.   
Frames are built from the retrieved data, after 
clustering it into several topical groups. Passages 
are clustered using a combination of hierarchical 
clustering and n-bin classification (Hardy et al, 
2002a). Each cluster represents a topic theme 
within the retrieved set: usually an alternative or 
complimentary interpretation of the user?s 
question. Since clusters are built out of small text 
passages, we initially associate a frame with each 
passage that serves as a seed of a cluster. We 
subsequently merge passages and their associated 
frames to arrive at one or more combined frames 
for the cluster. 
HITIQA starts text framing by building a 
general frame on the seed passages of the clusters 
and any of the top N (currently N=10) scored 
passages that are not already in a cluster. The 
general frame represents an event or a relation 
involving any number of entities, which make up 
the frame?s attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, 
ORGANIZATION, DATE, etc. Attributes are extracted 
from text passages by BBN?s Identifinder, which 
tags 24 types of named entities. The event/relation 
itself could be pretty much anything, e.g., accident, 
pollution, trade, etc. and it is captured into the 
TOPIC attribute from the central verb or noun 
phrase of the passage. In the general frame, 
attributes have no assigned roles; they are loosely 
grouped around the TOPIC (Figure 2).  
We have also defined three slightly more 
specialized typed frames by assigning roles to 
selected attributes in the general frame. These 
three ?specialized? frames are: (1) a Transfer 
frame with three roles including FROM, TO and 
OBJECT; (2) a two-role Relation frame with AGENT 
and OBJECT roles; and (3) an one-role Property 
frame. These typed frames represent certain 
generic events/relationships, which then map into 
more specific event types in each domain. Other 
frame types may be defined if needed, but we do 
not anticipate there will be more than a handful all 
together.2 For example, another 3-role frame may 
be State-Change frame with AGENT, OBJECT and 
INSTRUMENT roles, etc.3  
FRAME TYPE: General 
TOPIC: imported 
LOCATION: Iraq, France, Israel 
ORGANIZATION: IAEA [missed: Nukem] 
PERSON: Leonard Spector 
WEAPON: uranium, nuclear bomb 
DATES: 1981, 30 November 1990, .. 
FIGURE 2: A general frame obtained from the 
text passage in Figure 3 (not all attributes shown). 
 
Where the general frame is little more than just 
a ?bag of attributes?, the typed frames capture 
some internal structure of an event, but only to the 
extent required to enable an efficient dialogue with 
the user. Typed frames are ?triggered? by 
appearance of specific words in text, for example 
the word export may trigger a Transfer frame. A 
single text passage may invoke one or more typed 
frames, or none at all. When no typed frame is 
invoked, the general frame is used as default. If a 
typed frame is invoked, HITIQA will attempt to 
identify the roles, e.g. FROM, TO, OBJECT, etc. This 
is done by mapping general frame attributes 
selected from text onto the typed attributes in the 
frames. In any given domain, e.g., weapon non-
proliferation, both the trigger words and the role 
identification rules can be specialized from a 
                                                     
2 Scalability is certainly an outstanding issue here, and we are 
working on effective frame acquisition methods, which is outside of 
the scope of this paper. While classifications such as (Levin, 1993) or 
FrameNet (Fillmore, 2001) are relevant, we are currently aiming at a 
less detailed system. 
3 A more detailed discussion of possible frame types is beyond the 
scope of the current paper. 
training corpus of typical documents and 
questions. For example, the role-id rules rely both 
on syntactic cues and the expected entity types, 
which are domain adaptable.  
Domain adaptation is desirable for obtaining 
more focused dialogue, but it is not necessary for 
HITIQA to work. We used both setups under 
different conditions: the generic frames were used 
with TREC document collection to measure impact 
of IR precision on QA accuracy (Small et al, 
2004). The domain-adapted frames were used for 
sessions with intelligence analysts working with 
the WMD Domain (see below). Currently, the 
adaptation process includes manual tuning 
followed by corpus bootstrapping using an 
unsupervised learning method (Strzalkowski & 
Wang, 1996). We generally rely on BBN?s 
Identifinder for extraction of basic entities, and use 
bootstrapping to define additional entity types as 
well as to assign roles to attributes. 
The version of HITIQA reported here and used 
by analysts during the evaluation has been adapted 
to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-
Proliferation domain (WMD domain, henceforth).  
Figure 3 contains an example passage from this 
data set. In the WMD domain, the typed frames 
were mapped onto WMDTransfer 3-role frame, 
and two 2-role frames WMDTreaty  and 
WMDDevelop. Adapting the frames to the WMD 
domain required very minimal modification, such 
as adding the WEAPON entity to augment the 
Identifinder entity set, generating a list of 
international weapon control treaties, etc. 
The Bush Administration claimed that Iraq was 
within one year of producing a nuclear bomb. On 
30 November 1990... Leonard Spector said that 
Iraq possesses 200 tons of natural uranium 
imported and smuggled from several countries. 
Iraq possesses a few working centrifuges and the 
blueprints to build them. Iraq imported centrifuge 
materials from Nukem of the FRG and from other 
sources. One decade ago, Iraq imported 27 pounds 
of weapons-grade uranium from France, for Osirak 
nuclear research center. In 1981, Israel destroyed 
the Osirak nuclear reactor. In November 1990, the 
IAEA inspected Iraq and found all material 
accounted for....  
FIGURE 3: A text passage from the WMD 
domain data    
 
HITIQA frames define top-down constraints on 
how to interpret a given text passage, which is 
quite different from MUC4 template filling task 
                                                     
4 MUC, the Message Understanding Conference, funded by 
DARPA, involved the evaluation of information extraction systems 
applied to a common task. 
(Humphreys et al, 1998). What we?re trying to do 
here is to ?fit? a frame over a text passage. This 
also means that multiple frames can be associated 
with a text passage, or to be exact, with a cluster of 
passages. Since most of the passages that undergo 
the framing process are part of some cluster of 
very similar passages, the added redundancy helps 
to reinforce the most salient features for extraction. 
This makes the framing process potentially less 
error-prone than MUC-style template filling. 
A very similar framing process is applied to the 
user?s question, resulting in one or more Goal 
frames, which are subsequently compared to the 
data frames obtained from retrieved text passages. 
A Goal frame can be a general frame or any of the 
typed frames. Goal frames generated from the 
question, ?Has Iraq been able to import 
uranium?? are shown in Figures 4 and 5. 
FRAME TYPE: General 
TOPIC: import 
WEAPON:  uranium 
LOCATION: Iraq 
FIGURE 4: A general goal frame from the Iraq 
question 
The frame in Figure 4 is simply a General 
frame which is invoked first. HITIQA then 
discovers that TOPIC=import denotes a Transfer-
event in the WMD domain, so it creates a 
WMDTransfer frame that replaces the general 
frame. This new frame, shown in Figure 5, has 
three role attributes TRF_TO, TRF_FROM and 
TRF_OBJECT, plus the relation type (TRF_TYPE). 
Each role attribute is defined over an underlying 
general frame attribute (given in parentheses), 
which are used to compare frames of different 
types.  The role-id rules rely both on syntactic cues 
and the expected entity types, which are domain 
adaptable. 
FRAME TYPE: WMDTransfer 
TRF_TYPE (TOPIC): import 
TRF_TO (LOCATION): Iraq 
TRF_FROM (LOCATION, ORGANIZATION): ? 
TRF_OBJECT (WEAPON): uranium 
FIGURE 5: A typed goal frame from the Iraq 
question 
HITIQA automatically judges a particular data 
frame as relevant, and subsequently the 
corresponding segment of text as relevant, by 
comparison to the Goal frame. The data frames are 
scored based on the number of conflicts found with 
the Goal frame. The conflicts are mismatches on 
values of corresponding attributes, specifically 
when the data frame attribute list does not contain 
any of the entities in the corresponding Goal 
Frame attribute list.  If a data frame is found to 
have no conflicts, it is given the highest relevance 
rank, and a conflict score of zero.   
All other data frames are scored with an 
increasing value based on the number of conflicts, 
score 1 for frames with one conflict with the Goal 
frame, score 2 for two conflicts etc. Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the query are 
given the score 99 indicating the lowest rank. 
Currently, frames with a conflict score 99 are 
excluded from further processing as outliers. The 
frame in Figure 6 is scored as relevant to the user?s 
query and included in the answer space. 
FRAME TYPE: WMDTransfer 
TRF_TYPE (TOPIC): imported 
TRF_TO (LOCATION): Iraq 
TRF_FROM (LOCATION): France 
TRF_OBJECT (WEAPON): uranium 
CONFLICT SCORE: 0

text passage in Figure 3, in response to the Iraq 
question 
5 Enabling Dialogue with the User 
Framed information allows HITIQA to 
automatically judge text passages as fully or 
partially relevant and to conduct a meaningful 
dialogue with the user about their content. The 
purpose of the dialogue is to help the user navigate 
the answer space and to negotiate more precisely 
what information he or she is seeking. The main 
principle here is that the dialogue is primarily 
content oriented. Thus, it is okay to ask the user 
whether information about the AIDS conference in 
Cape Town should be included in the answer to a 
question about combating AIDS in Africa. 
However, the user should never be asked if a 
particular keyword is useful or not, or if a 
document is relevant or not.  
Our approach to dialogue in HITIQA is 
modeled to some degree upon the mixed-initiative 
dialogue management adopted in the AMITIES 
project (Hardy et al, 2002b). The main advantage 
of the AMITIES model is its reliance on data-
driven semantics which allows for spontaneous 
and mixed initiative dialogue to occur. By contrast, 
the major approaches to implementation of 
dialogue systems to date rely on systems of 
functional transitions that make the resulting 
system much less flexible. In the grammar-based 
approach, which is prevalent in commercial 
systems, such as in various telephony products, as 
well as in practically oriented research prototypes 
(e.g., DARPA Communicator; Seneff and Polifoni, 
2000; Ferguson and Allen, 1998), a complete 
dialogue transition graph is designed to guide the 
conversation and predict user responses, which is 
suitable for closed domains only. In the statistical 
variation of this approach, a transition graph is 
derived from a large body of annotated 
conversations (e.g., Walker, 2000; Litman and Pan, 
2002). This latter approach is facilitated through a 
dialogue annotation process, e.g., using Dialogue 
Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) (Allen 
and Core, 1997), which is a system of functional 
dialogue acts.  
Nonetheless, an efficient, spontaneous dialogue 
cannot be designed on a purely functional layer. 
Therefore, here we are primarily interested in the 
semantic layer, that is, the information exchange 
and information building effects of a conversation. 
In order to properly understand a dialogue, both 
semantic and functional layers need to be 
considered. In this paper we are concentrating 
exclusively on the semantic layer. 
6 Clarification Dialogue 
The clarification dialogue is when the user and 
the system negotiate the information task that 
needs to be performed. Data frames with a conflict 
score of 0 form the initial kernel answer space and 
HITIQA proceeds by generating an answer from 
this space. Depending upon the presence of other 
frames outside of this set, the system may initiate a 
dialogue with the user. When the Goal frame is a 
general frame HITIQA first initiates a clarification 
dialogue on existing general data frames that have 
one conflict. All of these 1-conflict general frames 
are first grouped on their common conflict 
attribute. HITIQA begins asking the user questions 
on these near-miss frame groups, with the largest 
group first. The groups must be at least groups of 
size N, where N is a user controlled setting.  This 
setting restricts of all HITIQA?s generated 
dialogue. HITIQA then check for the existence of 
any data frames that are one of the three typed 
frames. Clarification dialogue will be initiated on 
these, when all of their general attributes agree 
with the general attributes of the Goal frame 
respectively. Alternatively, if the Goal frame is one 
of the three type specific frames, a clarification 
dialogue is first initiated on groups of one conflict 
data frames that are the same type as the Goal 
frame. The clarification dialogue will then 
continue to the remaining two type specific frames 
if any exist, and finally on to any General data 
frames. 
A 1-conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal frame. This could be a 
mismatch on any of the general frame attributes, 
for example, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, 
etc., or in one of the role-assigned attributes, TO, 
FROM, OBJECT, etc.  A special case arises when the 
conflict occurs on the TOPIC attribute, which 
indicated the event type. Since all other attributes 
match, we may be looking at potentially different 
events (though similar type events) involving the 
same entities, occurring at the same location or 
time. The purpose of the clarification dialogue in 
this case is to probe which of these additional 
events may be of interest to the user.  
Another special case arises when the Goal 
frame has a different value of the TYPE attribute 
than a data frame. The purpose of the clarification 
dialogue here is to see if the user wishes to expand 
the answer space to include events of a different 
type. This situation is illustrated in the exchange 
shown in Figure 7.  
The clarification question asked by HITIQA in 
Figure 7 was obtained by comparing the Goal 
frame (Figure 5) to a partly matching frame 
(Figure 8) generated from another text passage. 
We note first that the Goal frame for this example 
is WMDTransfer type, while the data frame in 
Figure 8 is WMDDevelop type. Nonetheless, both 
frames match on their general-frame attributes 
WEAPON and LOCATION. Therefore, HITIQA asks 
the user if it should expand the answer space to 
include development of uranium in Iraq as well. 
User: ?Has Iraq been able to import uranium?? 
HITIQA: IRAQ REPORTED TO HAVE 
IMPORTED MISSILES AND URANIUM  
Supporting passage:  
...that Iraq possesses 200 tons of natural 
uranium imported and smuggled from several 
countries. Iraq possesses a few working 
centrifuges and the blueprints to build them. Iraq 
imported centrifuge materials from Nukem of the 
FRG and from other sources. One decade ago, 
Iraq imported 27 pounds of weapons-grade 
uranium from France, for Osirak nuclear research 
center... 
HITIQA: ?Are you also interested in 
background information on the uranium 
development program in Iraq?? 
User: ? 
 
FIGURE 7:  The clarification dialogue detail 
During the dialogue, as new information is 
obtained from the user, the Goal frame is updated 
and the scores of all the data frames are 
reevaluated.  If the user responds the equivalent of 
?yes? to the system clarification question in the 
dialogue in Figure 7, a corresponding 
WMDDevelop frame will be added to the set of 
active Goal frames and all WMDDevelop frames 
obtained from text passages will be re-scored for 
possible inclusion in the answer. 
FRAME TYPE: WMDDevelop    
DEV_TYPE (TOPIC): development, produced 
DEV_OBJ (WEAPON): nuc. weapons, uranium 
DEV_AGENT (LOCATION): Iraq, Tuwaitha 
CONFLICT SCORE: 2 
Conflicts with FRAME_TYPE and TOPIC  
FIGURE 8: A 2-conflict frame against the 
Iraq/uranium question that generated the dialogue 
in Figure 7. 
The user may end the dialogue at any point using 
the generated answer given the current state of the 
frames. Currently, the answer is simply composed 
of text passages from the zero conflict frames. In 
addition, HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for 
the text passages in the answer space.  This is done 
using a combination of text templates and simple 
grammar rules applied to the attributes of the 
passage frame. Figure 7 shows a portion of the 
answer generated by HITIQA for the Iraq query. 
7 HITIQA Preliminary Evaluations 
We have evaluated HITIQA in a series of 
workshops with professional analysts in order to 
obtain an in-depth and comprehensive assessment 
of the system usability and performance. In 
addition to evaluating our research progress, the 
purpose of these workshops was to test several 
evaluation instruments to see if they can be 
meaningfully applied to a complex information 
system such as HITIQA. 
     For the participating analysts, the primary 
activity at these workshops involved preparation of 
reports in response to ?scenarios? ? complex 
questions that often encompass multiple sub-
questions, aspects and hypotheses. For example, in 
one scenario, analysts were asked ti locate 
information about the al Qaeda terorist group: its 
membership, sources of funding and activities. In 
another scenario, the analysts were requested to 
find information on the chemical weapon Sarin. 
Figure 9 shows one of the analytical scenarios used 
in these workshops. We prepared a database of 
over 1GByte of text documents; it included articles 
from the Center for Non-proliferation (CNS) data 
collected for the AQUAINT program and similar 
data retrieved from the web using Google. The 
analysts? task was to prepare a report ?as much like 
what you would do in your normal work 
environment as possible.? Over the six days of the 
workshops, each analyst prepared five such reports 
in sessions of one to three hours. Each session 
involved multiple questions posed to the system, as 
well as clarification dialogue, visual browsing and 
report construction. Figure 10 shows an abridged 
transcript from another analytical session with 
HITIQA.  
 Figure 9: A scenario level analytic task  
One of our primary concerns was to design 
tasks that were similar in scope and difficulty to 
those that the analysts are used to performing at 
work and to ensure that they felt comfortable using 
the system. 5 questions in the scenario evaluation 
dealt with this issue; for example, one question 
asked how the scenarios compared in difficulty 
with the tasks the analysts normally perform at 
work. The mean score for these five questions was 
3.75 on a 5 point scale (five is the best score). The 
lowest score (M=2.88) was received on the 
question ?How did the scenario compare in 
difficulty to tasks that you normally perform at 
work??; this slightly above average rating of 
difficulty of the tasks was quite satisfactory for our 
purposes.  
    In the final evaluation, analysts were asked to 
rate their agreement with statements such as 
?Having HITIQA helps me find important 
information? (score 4.50), ?Having Hitiqa at work 
would help me find information faster than I can 
currently find it? (score 4.33), and ?Hitiqa would 
be a useful addition to the tools that I already have 
at work? (score 4.25). The mean normalized score 
for the combined final evaluation of Workshop I 
was 3.75 on the 5 point scale; this means that the 
system received many more ratings of 4 and 5 than 
of 1 and 2. Comments made by the analysts in the 
group discussion and in the individual interviews 
confirmed that analysts liked the interactive 
dialogue and were very pleased with the results. 
For example, one analyst said ?I learned more 
about Sarin gas in 30 minutes than I probably 
would have at work in a half a day.? As desired, 
the analysts also made many suggestions for 
improving the interface and the interoperation of 
The department chief has requested a report by the 
close of business today on the nuclear arms program in 
Iraq and how it was influenced by the neighboring 
countries. List the extent of the nuclear program in each 
involved country including funding, capabilities, quantity, 
etc. Your report should also include key figures in Iraq 
nuclear program as well as in other countries in the region, 
and,any travels that these key figures have made to other 
countries in regards to a nuclear program, any weapons 
that have been used in the past by either country, any 
purchases or trades that have been made relevant to 
weapons of mass destruction (possibly oil trade, etc.), any 
ingredients and chemicals that have been used, any 
potential weapons that could be under development, 
countries that are involved or have close ties to Iraq or her 
trade partners, possible locations of development sites, and 
possible companies or organizations that these countries 
work with for their nuclear arms program. Add any other 
information relating to the Iraqi Nuclear Arms Programs.  
the visual and text display. For a research system 
undergoing its first rigorous evaluation, these 
results are very satisfactory ? they support the

The AQUAINT Program has entered its second 
phase in May 2004. Over the next 2 years our 
focus will be on augmenting HITIQA to provide 
more advanced dialogue capabilities, including 
problem solving dialogue related to hypothesis 
formation and verification. This implies building 
up system?s knowledge acquisition capabilities by 
exploiting diverse data sources, including 
structured databases and the internet.

Abstract 
In this paper we describe some preliminary 
results of qualitative evaluation of the answer-
ing system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive 
Question Answering) which has been devel-
oped over the last 2 years as an advanced re-
search tool for information analysts. HITIQA 
is an interactive open-domain question an-
swering technology designed to allow analysts 
to pose complex exploratory questions in natu-
ral language and obtain relevant information 
units to prepare their briefing reports in order 
to satisfy a given scenario. The system uses 
novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clari-
fication dialogue with the user that explores 
the scope and the context of the desired answer 
space. The system has undergone extensive 
hands-on evaluations by a group of intelli-
gence analysts representing various foreign in-
telligence services. This evaluation validated 
the overall approach in HITIQA but also ex-
posed limitations of the current prototype.  
1   Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as ?What 
has been Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kos-
ovo?? The distinguishing property of such questions is 
that one cannot generally anticipate what might consti-
tute the answer. While certain types of things may be 
expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is 
heavily conditioned by what information is in fact avail-
able on the topic, background knowledge of the user, 
context in the scenario, intended audience, etc. From a 
practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often un-
derspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of pos-
sible answers. Therefore, clarification dialogue is often 
needed to negotiate with the user the exact scope and 
intent of the question, and clarify whether similar topics 
found might also be of interest to the user in order to 
complete their scenario report. This paper will present 
results from a series of evaluations conducted in a series 
of workshops with the intended end users of HITIQA 
(professional intelligence analysts) using the system to 
solve realistic analytic problems. 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in the 
state of the art of automated question answering.  In this 
paper we focus on our approach to analytical question 
answering in order to produce a report in response to a 
given scenario.  We also report on the user evaluations 
we conducted and their results with respect to our 
unique approach. 
2   Analytical QA Scenarios 
Analytical scenarios are information task directives 
assigned to analysts to support a larger foreign policy 
process. Scenarios thus contain the information need 
specifications at various levels of detail,  the type, for-
mat and timing of the response required (an intelligence 
report) as well as the primary recipient of the report 
(e.g., the Secretary of State). A hypothetical, but realis-
tic scenario is shown in Figure 1 below. This scenario, 
along with several others like it, was used in evaluating 
 HITIQA performance and fitness for supporting the 
analytical process.  
As can be readily assessed from the directives in 
Figure 1, scenarios are not merely tough questions; they 
are far too complex to be considered as a single question 
at all. It is equally clear that no simple answer can be 
expected and that preparing a report would mean find-
ing answers to a series of interlocking questions or vari-
ous granularities.  
 
Scenario: The al-Qaida Terrorist Group 
 
As an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, your pro-
fession entails knowledge of the al-Qaida terrorist group.  
Your division chief has ordered a detailed report on the al-
Qaida Terrorist Group due in three weeks. Provide as much 
information as possible on this militant organization. Eventu-
ally, this report should present information regarding the most 
essential concerns, including who are the key figures involved 
with al-Qaida along with other organizations, countries, and 
members that are affiliated, any trades that al-Qaida has made 
with organizations or countries, what facilities they possess, 
where they receive their financial support, what capabilities 
they have (CBW program, other weapons, etc.) and how have 
they acquired them, what is their possible future activity, how 
their training program operates, who their new members are. 
Also, include any other relevant information to your report as 
you see fit.  
 FIGURE 1: Scenario used during user evaluations 
  
We have organized a series of usability evaluations 
with active duty intelligence analysts to find out how 
they approach the problem of solving a scenario. The 
prerequisites for this were are follows: 
1. A robust, broadly functional analytical QA sys-
tem capable of sustaining realistic analytic 
tasks. 
2. A realistic corpus of ?raw intelligence? in form 
of varying quality and verity new-like reports. 
3. A set of realistic, average complexity analytic 
tasks or scenarios to be used. 
HITIQA has been developed over the past two years as 
an open-ended highly flexible interactive QA system to 
allow just this type of evaluation. The system supports a 
variety of information gathering functions without 
straight jacketing the user into any particular mode or 
interaction style. The system does not produce cut and 
dry ?answers?; instead it allows the analysts to build the 
answers the way they want them. While this open-
endedness may seem like unfinished business, we be-
lieve that further development must take into account 
the needs of analysts if they were ever to adopt this 
technology in their work. 
Our main hypothesis is that analysts employ a range 
of strategies to find the required information and that 
these strategies depend significantly upon the nature of 
the task and the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. Our experience with interactive systems also indi-
cated that real users are unlikely to follow any single 
information exploration strategy, but instead would use 
multiple, parallel, even overlapping approaches in order 
to maximize the returns and their confidence in the re-
sults. As a corollary we may expect that the scenario 
tasks are unlikely to be systematically decomposed into 
a series of smaller tasks ahead of actual search. In other 
words, the analytical process is a dialogue, not a se-
quence of commands. Moreover, questions actually 
submitted to the system during the analytical process 
seldom seek just the exact answer, instead they are often 
considered as ?light beams? through the data: focusing 
on the answer but also illuminating adjacent, related 
information which may prove just as valuable.  
AFRL, NIST, CNS and ARDA collaborated in the 
development of scenarios used in our evaluation ses-
sions.  
3   Data Driven Semantics of Questions 
When the user poses a question to a system having 
access to a huge database of unstructured data (text 
files), we need to first reduce the big pile to perhaps a 
handful of documents where the answer is likely to be 
found. The easiest way to do it is to convert the question 
into a search query (by removing stopwords and stem-
ming and tokenizing other words) and submitting this 
query to a fast but non-exact document retrieval system, 
e.g.,   Smart (Buckley, 1985) or InQuery (Callan et al, 
1992), or if you are on the web, Google, etc.   
In the current prototype of HITIQA, we use a com-
bination of Google and InQuery to retrieve the top 50 to 
200 documents from a large document database, con-
sisting of several smaller collections such as newspaper 
stories, documents from the Center of Nonproliferation 
Studies, as well as web mined files.  The retrieved 
documents are then broken down into passages, mostly 
exploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of 
the original sources. 
The set of text passages returned from the initial 
search is the first (very crude) approximation of the An-
swer Space for the user?s first question. In order to de-
termine what this answer space consists of we perform 
automatic analysis (a combination of hierarchical clus-
tering and classification) to uncover if what we got is a 
fairly homogenous collection (i.e., all texts have very 
similar content), or whether there are a number of di-
verse topics or aspects represented in there, somehow 
tied together by a common thread. In the former case, 
we may be reasonably confident that we have the an-
swer, modulo the retrievable information. In the latter 
case, we know that the question is more complex than 
the user may have intended, and a negotiation process is 
needed to clarify topics of interest for the scenario re-
port. 
 The next step is to measure how well each of the as-
pects within the answer space is ?matching up? against 
the original question. This is accomplished through the 
framing process described later in this paper. The out-
come of the framing process is twofold: first, the alter-
native interpretations of the question are ranked within 3 
broad categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers. 
Second, salient concepts and attributes for each topi-
cal/aspectual group are extracted into topic frames. This 
enables the system to conduct a meaningful dialogue 
with the user, a dialogue which is wholly content ori-
ented, and entirely data driven.  
4   Partial structuring of text data 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to de-
lineate the gap between the meaning of the user?s ques-
tion and the system ?understanding? of this question. 
The framing is an attempt to impose a partial structure 
on the text that would allow the system to systemati-
cally compare different text pieces against each other 
and against the question, and also to communicate with 
the user about this. In particular, the framing process 
may uncover topics or aspects within the answer space 
which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus 
may be unaware of their existence.  This approach is 
particularly beneficial to the needs of the scenario prob-
lem, where these similar aspects frequently are needed 
in completely ?answering? the scenario, with the sce-
nario report.   
In the current version of HITIQA, frames are pre-
defined structures representing various event types. We 
started with the General frame, which can represent any 
event or relation involving any number of entities such 
as people, locations, organizations, time, and so forth.  
In a specialized domain, or if the user interests are 
known to be limited to a particular set of topics, we de-
fine domain-specific frames. Current HITIQA prototype 
has three broad domain-specific frames, related to the 
Weapon of Mass Destruction proliferation domain 
(which was one of the domains of interest to our users). 
These frames are: WMDTransfer, WMDDevelop, 
WMDTreaty, and of course we keep the General frame.  
Obviously, these three frames do not cover the domain 
represented by our data set; they merely capture the 
most commonly occurring types of events. All frames 
contain a small number of core attributes, such as LO-
CATION, PERSON, COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, ETC., which 
are extracted using BBN?s Identifinder software, which 
extracts 24 types of entities.  Domain-specific frames 
add event specific attributes, which may require extract-
ing additional items from text, or assigning roles to ex-
isting attributes, or both.  For example, WMDTransfer?s 
attributes TRANSFER_TO and TRANSFER_FROM define 
roles of some COUNTRY or ORGANIZATION, while the 
TRANSFER_TYPE attribute scans the text for keywords 
that may indicate the type of transfer, e.g., export, sale, 
etc.  
HITIQA creates a Goal frame for the user?s ques-
tion, which can be subsequently compared to the data 
frames obtained from retrieved data. A Goal frame can 
be a General frame or any of the domain specific frames 
available in HITIQA.  For example, the Goal frame 
generated from the question, ?Where does al-Qaida 
have training facilities?? is a General frame as shown in 
Figure 2.  This was the first question generated by one 
of our analysts during the first evaluation while working 
on the al-Qaida scenario shown in Figure 1.

RELEVANCE:  Conflict: [Topic] 
FIGURE 3: A HITIQA generated data frame and the un-
derlying text passage. Words in bold were used to fill the 
Frame.   
 
HTIQA automatically judges a particular data frame 
as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding seg-
ment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal 
frame. The data frames are scored based on the number 
of conflicts found between them and the Goal frame. 
The conflicts are mismatches on values of correspond-
ing attributes. If a data frame is found to have no con-
flicts, it is given the highest relevance rank, and a con-
flict score of zero.  All other data frames are scored with 
 a decreasing value based on the number of conflicts, 
negative one for frames with one conflict with the Goal 
frame, negative two for two conflicts etc.  Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the question are 
given a score of -99 indicating the lowest relevancy 
rank.  Currently, frames with a conflict score of -99 are 
excluded from further processing as outliers. The frame 
in Figure 2 is scored as a near miss and will generate 
dialogue, where the user will decide whether or not it 
should be included in the answer space. 
5   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space. Depending upon the pres-
ence of other frames outside of this set, the system ei-
ther proceeds to generate the answer or initiates a dia-
logue with the user.  HITIQA begins asking the user 
questions on these near-miss frame groups, with the 
largest group first.  The groups must be at least groups 
of size N, where N is a user controlled setting.  This 
setting restricts all of HITIQA?s generated dialogue.   
A one conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal frame. This could be a mis-
match on any of the General attributes, for example, 
LOCATION, or ORGANIZATION, or TIME, etc., or in one of 
the domain specific attributes, TRANSFER_TO, or TRANS-
FER_TYPE, etc.  A special case arises when the conflict 
occurs on the TOPIC attribute.  Since all other attributes 
match, we may be looking at potentially different events 
or situations involving the same entities, or occurring at 
the same location or time. The purpose of the clarifica-
tion dialogue in this case is to probe which of these top-
ics may be of interest to the user.  Another special case 
arises when the Goal frame is of a different type than a 
data frame.  The purpose of the clarification dialogue in 
this case is to expand the user?s answer space into a 
different but possibly related event.  A combination of 
both of these cases is illustrated in the exchange in Fig-
ure 4 below.   
User: ?Where does al-Qaida have training facili-
ties?? 
HITIQA: ?Do you want to see material on the trans-
fer of weapons and intelligence to al-Qaida?? 
FIGURE 4: Dialogue generated by HITIQA for the al-Qaida 
training facilities question 
 
In order to understand what happened here, we need 
to note first that the Goal frame for this example is a 
General Frame, from Figure 2.  One of the data frames 
that caused this dialogue to be generated is shown in 
Figure 3 above.  While this frame is of a different frame 
type than the Goal frame, namely WMD Transfer, it 
matches on all of the General attributes except TOPIC, so 
HITIQA asks the user if they would like to expand their 
answer space to this other domain, namely to include 
the transfer of weapons involving this organization as 
well.

FIGURE 5: Partial answer generated by HITIQA to the al-
Qaida training facilities question 
 
During the dialogue, as new information is obtained 
from the user, the Goal frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated. The system may 
interpret the new information as a positive or negative. 
Positives are added to the Goal frame. Negatives are 
stored in a Negative-Goal frame and will also be used in 
the re-scoring of the data frames, possibly causing con-
flict scores to increase. If the user responds the equiva-
lent of ?yes? to the system clarification question in Fig-
ure 4, a corresponding WMD Transfer frame would be 
added to the Goal frame and all WMD Transfer frames 
will be re-scored.  If the user responds ?no?, the Nega-
tive-Goal frame will be generated and all WMD Trans-
fer frames will be rescored to 99 in order to remove 
them from further processing.  The user may end the 
dialogue, at any point and have an answer generated 
given the current state of the frames.   
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text 
passages from the zero conflict frames. In addition, 
HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for the text passages 
in all the Frames in the answer space.  This is done us-
ing grammar rules and the attributes of a frame.  Figure 
 5 shows a portion of the answer generated by HITIQA 
for the al-Qaida training facilities question. 
 
6   HITIQA Interface 
There are two distinct ways for the user to interact 
with HITIQA to explore their answer space.  The An-
swer Panel displays the user?s current answer at any 
given time during the interaction for a single question.  
Through this panel the user can read the paragraphs that 
are currently in their answer.  There are links on this 
panel so the user is able to view the full original source 
document from which the passage(s) were extracted. 
 The Visual panel offers the user an alternative to 
reading text by providing a tool for visually browsing 
the entire answer space.  Figure 6 shows a typical view 
of the visualization panel. The spheres are representa-
tive of single frames and groups of frames.  The user?s 
attention may be drawn to particular frames by the color 
coding or the attribute spikes.  The colors represent the 
frame?s score, so the user can quickly see what is in 
their answer, blue, and what is not, all other colors.  The 
attribute spikes may also be used as a navigation tool.  
The active attribute is chosen by the user through radio 
buttons. The current active attribute in Figure 6, is Lo-
cation.  This displays all instances of locations men-
tioned in the corresponding text. 
 
 
        Figure 6: Frame Level Display 
 
The underlying text that was used to build the frame 
may be displayed in the lower right hand window.  In 
this text display window there is a hyperlink that takes 
the user directly to the full source document. The user is 
able to interact with this panel by adding and removing 
information from their generated answer. Moving from 
the visualization to the textual dialogue, the generated 
answer, and back is seamless in a sense that any 
changes to the frame scores in one modality are imme-
diately accessible to the user in another modality. Users 
can add and remove frames from the answer space and 
HITIQA will always seamlessly pickup a new dialogue 
or generate a new answer.  
 
7   HITIQA Qualitative Evaluations 
In order to assess our progress thus far, and to also 
develop metrics to guide future evaluation, we invited a 
group of analysts employed by the US government to 
participate in two three-day workshops held in Septem-
ber and October 2003.  
The two basic objectives of the workshops were: 
1. To perform a realistic assessment of the useful-
ness and usability of HITIQA as an end-to-end system, 
from the information seeker's initial questions to com-
pletion of a draft report.  
2. To develop metrics to compare the answers ob-
tained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of 
the support that HITIQA provides.     
Each of these objectives entails a particular chal-
lenge. Performing a realistic assessment of HITIQA is 
difficult because many of the resources that the analysts 
use, as well as the reports they produce, are classified 
and therefore inaccessible to researchers.  
Assessing the quality of the support that the system 
provides is not easy because analytical questions rarely 
have a single right answer. It is not obvious how to de-
fine, for example, the precision of the system. We there-
fore conducted an 'information unit' exercise, whose 
purpose was to determine whether the analysts could 
identify information building blocks in their reports, so 
that we could compare and contrast different reports.  
To obtain an adequate supply of appropriate text 
data to support extensive question answering sessions 
(1, 2, 3 and 4 hours long), we prepared a new corpus of 
approximately 1.2 Gbytes. This new corpus consists of 
the reports from the Center for Non-Proliferation Stud-
ies (CNS) collected for the AQUAINT Program, aug-
mented with a much larger collection of texts on similar 
subject matter mined from the web using Google1. The 
final corpus proved to be sufficient to support about 
three hours of use of HITIQA to ?solve? each of the 
scenarios. 
The first day of the first workshop was devoted to 
training, including a two-part proficiency test. HITIQA 
is a fairly complex system, that includes multiple layers 
of data processing and user interaction, and it was criti-
cal that the users are sufficiently ?fluent? if we were to 
measure their productivity. The analysts' primary task 
on the second day was preparation of reports in re-
sponse to the scenarios. 
                                                 
1 Google has kindly agreed to temporarily extend our 
usage license so we could collect the data over a short 
time. 
  The third day was devoted to quantitative and quali-
tative evaluation, discussed later. In addition, we asked 
the analysts to score each others reports, as well as to 
identify key information units in them. These informa-
tion units could be later compared across different re-
ports in order to determine their completeness.  
8   Workshop Results 
The results of the quantitative evaluations strongly vali-
date the approach that we have taken. These conclusions 
are confirmed by analysts comments gleaned both from 
the formal qualitative assessment and from informal 
discussion. As one analyst said, ?the system as it stands 
now, in my mind, gave me enough information to try to 
put together a 80% solution but ?I don't think you're 
ever gonna reach that 100% state.? At the same time, we 
learned a great deal about how analysts work. 
It is important to determine the realism of the sce-
narios used during the workshop relative to the analysts? 
current work tasks in order for any results to be mean-
ingful. Each analyst was asked a series of five questions 
such as, ?How realistic was the scenario?  In other 
words did it resemble tasks you could imagine perform-
ing at work?? These 5 questions were all relative to the 
realism and difficulty of the scenario tasks.  Analysts 
used a scale of 1 to 5 based on their agreement with the 
statements, where 5 was complete agreement.  Our 
mean score was 3.84, indicating our scenarios were real-
istic and of about average difficulty when compared to 
the work they normally perform.   
We have classified the type of passages that an ana-
lyst copied to their report into two categories, answer 
passages and additional information passages, see Fig-
ure 7 below.  The answer passages either exactly an-
swered the user?s initial question or supplied supporting 
information.  The additional passages do not answer the 
original question posed, but may have been added to the 
answer through dialogue, or through the user?s explora-
tion of document links offered.  This could be a piece of 
information needed to satisfy some other aspect of the 
scenario that they had not asked about yet, or possibly a 
topic the user had not even considered but found rele-
vant when it was presented to them. As can be seen 
there was a very large amount of ?additional? informa-
tion that the user copied to their report.  The amounts 
reported here are the averages for all of the analysts for 
both workshops.  This supports our hypothesis that ana-
lysts seldom seek just the exact answer, but they are 
also looking at adjacent, related information, much of 
which they retain for their report.  Note that there were a 
small number of passages that contained a combination 
of answer and additional information; these were added 
to answer.

Figure 8: Number of Passages Copied Vs. Those Viewed 
 
We should now establish the number of passages 
copied versus those viewed, relative to links and the 
answer.  Figure 8 above shows the total number of pas-
sages copied versus the total number of passages 
viewed.  It is seen that many more passages need to be 
viewed through full document links before a useful pas-
sage is found.  In comparison a much smaller number of 
answer passages need to be viewed from the Answer 
panel in order to find useful passages.   
All of the analysts? sessions were recorded using 
Camtasia.  Figure 9 shows an annotation created for a 
typical session.  Analysts were observed to utilize a 
range of varying strategies as they worked different 
scenarios and even while working different queries of 
the same scenario.  Figure 10 shows the statistics for 
each Analyst?s use of HITIQA while working on the 
scenarios during the two workshops (note that Analyst-4 
was only able to attend the first workshop and Analyst-1 
did not create a report for Scenario 2).  Some of the 
variations in strategies among the analysts while work-
ing the same scenario are quite striking.  For example, 
Scenario 4 was  worked quite  differently  by  Analyst-1  
 versus Analyst-2.  While Analyst-1 spent almost all of 
his/her  time in  the Visual Panel, Analyst-2 spent virtu-
ally all of his/her time in the Answer panel.  Analyst-1 
produced his/her report copying 52 paragraphs while 
Analyst 2 copied only 35.  There are also large varia-
tions in the number of questions asked for the same sce-
nario.  Examine scenario 5, where Analyst-3 asked a 
total of 11 questions and Analyst-2 only needed to ask 2 
questions.  Relative to this, Analyst-3, who asked a 
much larger number of questions, copied only 28 pas-
sages, whereas Analyst-2 copied 31.  These variations, 
as stated earlier in the paper, could be due to the nature 
of the task, the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. For example, the difference in the number of 
questions asked between Analyst-2 and Analyst-3 for 
scenario 5 may be due to difference in search strategies 
employed, but may also reflect the amount of back-
ground knowledge of the topic.

There is, however, some consistency across the ana-
lysts in the amount of information retained per scenario. 
The charts are drawn in logarithmic scale, but it should 
be visible that scenarios 2 and 3 produced less interac-
tion and required less information to fulfill than scenar-
ios 4 and 5. It is also visible that scenario 1 required 
more questions to be asked and more exploration to be 
done in visual panel than other scenarios. 
Finally, it is important to provide some metric re-
garding the user?s overall satisfaction with their use of 
HITIQA.  At the end of each workshop Analysts were 
given a series of 17 questions, such as ?HITIQA helps 
me find important information?, shown in Figure 11, to 
assess their overall experience with the system.  Many 
of these questions were designed for the user to com-
pare HITIQA to the current tools they are using for this 
type of task.   Analysts again used a scale of 1 to 5 
based on their agreement with the statements.  The re-
sults were then converted, where 5 would always denote 
the best, and are shown in Figure 11 below.  It is impor-
tant to note that we scored highly overall, but addition-
ally we scored highly in the majority of questions rela-
tive to comparison of their current tools.  For example, 
for Question 14: ?Having HITIQA at work would help 
me find information faster than I can currently find it?, 
our mean score was 3.83.

In summary, the results from these two evaluations 
indicate that HITIQA, in its current state, is already 
competitive with the tools that the analysts are currently 
using in their work, supporting our overall approach to 
Analytical Question Answering.  HTIQA provides the 
user with a tool to find the passages needed to complete 
a report for a given scenario.  While working on a sce-
nario HITIQA has been shown to provide information 
which exactly answers the user?s question, and addi-
tionally HITIQA?s method brings to light other related 
information that the analyst retains in order to complete 
their report.
