Abstract
This paper presents the results of a series
of experiments which examine the impact
of two information status categories (given
and new) and frequency of occurrence on
pitch accent realisations. More specifi-
cally the experiments explore within-type
similarity of pitch accent productions and
the effect information status and frequency
of occurrence have on these productions.
The results indicate a significant influence
of both pitch accent type and information
status category on the degree of within-
type variability, in line with exemplar-
theoretic expectations.
1 Introduction
It seems both intuitive and likely that prosody
should have a significant role to play in marking
information status in speech. While there are well
established expectations concerning typical asso-
ciations between categories of information status
and categories of pitch accent, e.g. rising L?H
accents are often a marker for givenness, there
is nevertheless some variability here (Baumann,
2006). Furthermore, little research has focused on
how pitch accent tokens of the same type are re-
alised nor have the effects of information status
and frequency of occurrence been considered.
From the perspective of speech technology, the
tasks of automatically inferring and assigning in-
formation status clearly have significant impor-
tance for speech synthesis and speech understand-
ing systems.
The research presented in this paper examines a
number of questions concerning the relationship
between two information status categories (new
and given), and how tokens of associated pitch ac-
cent types are realised. Furthermore the effect of
frequency of occurrence is also examined from an
exemplar-theoretic perspective.
The questions directly addressed in this paper
are as follows:
1. How are different tokens of a pitch accent
type realised?
Does frequency of occurrence of the pitch ac-
cent type play a role?
2. What effect does information status have on
realisations of a pitch accent type?
Does frequency of occurrence of the informa-
tion status category play a role?
3. Does frequency of occurrence in pitch ac-
cents and in information status play a role,
i.e. is there a combined effect?
In examining the realisation of pitch accent to-
kens, their degree of similarity is the characteristic
under investigation. Similarity is calculated by de-
termining the cosine of the angle between pairs of
pitch accent vector representations (see section 6).
The results in this study are examined from
an exemplar-theoretic perspective (see section 3).
The expectations within that framework are based
upon two different aspects. Firstly, it is expected
that, since all exemplars are stored, exemplars of
a type that occur often, offer the speaker a wider
selection of exemplars to choose from during pro-
duction (Schweitzer and Mo?bius, 2004), i.e. the
realisations are expected to be more variable than
those of a rare type. However, another aspect of
Exemplar Theory has to be considered, namely en-
trenchment (Pierrehumbert, 2001; Bybee, 2006).
The central idea here is that frequently occurring
behaviours undergo processes of entrenchment,
they become in some sense routine. Therefore re-
alisations of a very frequent type are expected to
be realised similar to each other. Thus, similarity
and variability are expressions of the same charac-
teristic: the higher the degree of similarity of pitch
accent tokens, the lower their realisation variabil-
ity.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Sec-
tion 2 briefly examines previous work on the in-
teraction of information status categories and pitch
accents. Section 3 provides a short introduction to
Exemplar Theory. In this study similarity of pitch
accent realisations on syllables, annotated with the
information status categories of the words they be-
long to, is examined using the parametric intona-
tion model (Mo?hler, 1998) which is outlined in
Section 4. Section 5 discusses the corpus em-
ployed. Section 6 introduces a general methodol-
ogy which is used in the experiments in Sections 7,
8 and 9. Section 10 then presents some discussion,
conclusions and opportunities for future research.
2 Information Status and Intonation
It is commonly assumed that pitch accents are the
main correlate of information status1 in speech
(Halliday, 1967). Generally, accenting is said
to signal novelty while deaccenting signals given
information (Brown, 1983), although there is
counter evidence: various studies note given in-
formation being accented (Yule, 1980; Bard and
Aylett, 1999). Terken and Hirschberg (1994) point
out that new information can also be deaccented.
As for the question of which pitch accent type
(in terms of ToBI categories (Silverman et al,
1992)) is typically assigned to different degrees of
givenness, Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990)
find H? to be the standard novelty accent for En-
glish, a finding which has also been confirmed by
Baumann (2006) and Schweitzer et al (2008) for
German. Given information on the other hand, if
accented at all, is found to carry L? accent in En-
glish (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990). Bau-
mann (2006) finds deaccentuation to be the most
preferred realisation for givenness in his experi-
mental phonetics studies on German. However,
Baumann (2006) points out that H+L? has also
been found as a marker of givenness in a German
corpus study. Previous findings on the corpus used
in the present study found L?H being the typical
marker for givenness (Schweitzer et al, 2008).
Leaving the phonological level and examining
correlates of information status in acoustic detail,
Kohler (1991) reports that in a falling accent, an
early peak indicates established facts, while a me-
dial peak is used to mark novelty. In a recent

the first time. Before that the terms givenness, novelty or in-
formation structure were used for these concepts.
study Ku?gler and Fe?ry (2008) found givenness to
lower the high tones of prenuclear pitch accents
and to cancel them out postnuclearly. These find-
ings among others (Ku?gler and Fe?ry, 2008) moti-
vate an examination of the acoustic detail of pitch
accent shape across different information status
categories.
The experiments presented here go one step fur-
ther, however, in that they also investigate poten-
tial exemplar-theoretic effects.
3 Exemplar Theory
Exemplar Theory is concerned with the idea that
the acquisition of language is significantly facil-
itated by repeated exposure to concrete language
input, and it has successfully accounted for a num-
ber of language phenomena, including diachronic
language change and frequency of occurrence ef-
fects (Bybee, 2006), the emergence of gram-
matical knowledge (Abbot-Smith and Tomasello,
2006), syllable duration variability (Schweitzer
and Mo?bius, 2004; Walsh et al, 2007), entrench-
ment and lenition (Pierrehumbert, 2001), among
others. Central to Exemplar Theory are the notions
of exemplar storage, frequency of occurrence, re-
cency of occurrence, and similarity. There is an
increasing body of evidence which indicates that
significant storage of language input exemplars,
rich in detail, takes place in memory (Johnson,
1997; Croot and Rastle, 2004; Whiteside and Var-
ley, 1998). These stored exemplars are then em-
ployed in the categorisation of new input percepts.
Similarly, production is facilitated by accessing
these stored exemplars. Computational models of
the exemplar memory also argue that it is in a con-
stant state of flux with new inputs updating it and
old unused exemplars gradually fading away (Pier-
rehumbert, 2001).
Up to now, virtually no exemplar-theoretic re-
search has examined pitch accent prosody (but
see Marsi et al (2003) for memory-based predic-
tion of pitch accents and prosodic boundaries, and
Walsh et al (2008)(discussed below)) and to the
authors? knowledge this paper represents the first
attempt to examine the relationship between pitch
accent prosody and information status from an
exemplar-theoretic perspective. Given the consid-
erable weight of evidence for the influence of fre-
quency of occurrence effects in a variety of other
linguistic domains it seems reasonable to explore
such effects on pitch accent and information sta-
729
tus realisations. For example, what effect might
givenness have on a frequently/infrequently occur-
ring pitch accent? Does novelty produce a similar
result?
The search for possible frequency of occur-
rence effects takes place with respect to pitch ac-
cent shapes captured by the parametric intonation
model discussed next.
4 The Parametric Representation of
Intonation Events - PaIntE
The model approximates stretches of F0 by em-
ploying a phonetically motivated model function
(Mo?hler, 1998). This function consists of the sum
of two sigmoids (rising and falling) with a fixed
time delay which is selected so that the peak does
not fall below 96% of the function?s range. The re-
sulting function has six parameters which describe
the contour and were employed in the analysis: pa-
rameters a1 and a2 express the gradient of the ac-
cent?s rise and fall, parameter b describes the ac-
cent?s temporal alignment (which has been shown
to be crucial in the description of an accent?s shape
(van Santen and Mo?bius, 2000)), c1 and c2 model
the ranges of the rising and falling amplitude of
the accent?s contour, respectively, and parameter d
expresses the peak height of the accent.2 These six
parameters are thus appropriate to describe differ-
ent pitch accent shapes.
For the annotation of intonation the GToBI(S)
annotation scheme (Mayer, 1995) was used. In
earlier versions of PaIntE, the approximation of
the F0-contour for H?L and H? was carried out on
the accented and post?accented syllables. How-
ever, for these accents the beginning of the rise is
likely to start at the preaccented syllable. In the
current version of PaIntE the window used for the
approximation of the F0-contour for H?L and H?
accents has been extended to the preaccented syl-
lable, so that the parameters are calculated over
the span of the accented syllables and its immedi-
ate neighbours (unless it is followed by a boundary
tone which causes the window to end at the end of
the accented syllable).
5 Corpus
The experiments that follow (sections 7, 9 and 8),
were carried out on German pitch accents from the
2Further information and illustrations concerning the me-
chanics of the PaIntE model can be found in Mo?hler and
Conkie (1998).
IMS Radio News Corpus (Rapp, 1998). This cor-
pus was automatically segmented and manually la-
belled according to GToBI(S) (Mayer, 1995). In
the corpus, 1233 syllables are associated with an
L?H accent, 704 with an H?L accent and 162 with
an H? accent.
The corpus contains data from three speakers,
two female and a male one, but the majority of the
data is produced by the male speaker (888 L?H
accents, 527 H?L accents and 152 H? accents). In
order to maximise the number of tokens, all three
speakers were combined. Of the analysed data,
77.92% come from the male speaker. However,
it is not necessarily the case that the same percent-
age of the variability also comes from this speaker:
Both, PaIntE and z-scoring (cf. section 6) nor-
malise across speakers, so the contribution from
each individual speaker is unclear.
The textual transcription of the corpus was an-
notated with respect to information status using
the annotation scheme proposed by Riester (2008).
In this taxonomy information status categories re-
flect the default contexts in which presuppositions
are resolved, which include e. g. discourse context,
environment context or encyclopaedic context.
The annotations are based solely on the written
text and follow strict semantic criteria. Given that
textual information alone (i.e. without prosodic
or speech related information) is not necessarily
sufficient to unambiguously determine the infor-
mation status associated with a particular word,
there are therefore cases where words have mul-
tiple annotations, reflecting underspecification of
information status. However, it is important to
note that in all the experiments reported here, only
unambiguous cases are considered.
The rich annotation scheme employed in the
corpus makes establishing inter-annotator agree-
ment a time-consuming task which is currently un-
derway. Nevertheless, the annotation process was
set up in a way to ensure a maximal smoothing of
uncertainties. Texts were independently labelled
by two annotators. Subsequently, a third, more ex-
perienced annotator compared the two results and,
in the case of discrepancies, took a final decision.
In the present study the categories given and
new are examined. These categories do not rep-
resent a binary distinction but are two extremes
from a set of clearly distinguished categories. For
the most part they correspond to the categories tex-
tually given and brand-new that are used in Bau-
730
mann (2006), but their scope is more tightly con-
strained. The information status annotations are
mapped to the phonetically transcribed speech sig-
nals, from which individual syllable tokens bear-
ing information status are derived.
Syllables for which one of the PaIntE-
parameters was identified as an outlier, were re-
moved. Outliers were defined such that the upper
2.5 percentile as well as the lower 2.5 percentile
of the data were excluded. This led to a reduced
number of pitch accent tokens: 1021 L?H accents,
571H?L accents and 134H? accents. Thus, there
is a continuum of frequency of occurrence, high to
low, from L?H to H?.
With respect to information status, 102 L?H ac-
cents, 87H?L accents and 21H? accents were un-
ambiguously labelled as new. For givenness the
number of tokens is: 114 L?H accents, 44H?L ac-
cents and 10H? accents.
6 General Methodology
In the experiments the general methodology for
calculation of similarity detailed in this section
was employed.
For tokens of the pitch accent types L?H, H?L
and H?, each token was modelled using the full
set of PaIntE parameters. Thus, each token was
represented in terms of a 6-dimensional vector.
For each of the pitch accent types the following
steps were carried out:
? For each 6-dimensional pitch accent category
token calculate the z-score value for each di-
mension. The z-score value represents the
number of standard deviations the value is
away from the mean value for that dimension
and allows comparison of values from differ-
ent normal distributions. The z-score is given
by:
z ? scoredim =
valuedim ?meandim
sdevdim
(1)
Hence, at this point each pitch accent is repre-
sented by a 6-dimensional vector where each
dimension value is a z-score.
? For each token z-scored vector calculate how
similar it is to every other z-scored vector
within the same pitch accent category, and,
in Experiment 2 and 3, with the same infor-
mation status value (e.g. new), using the co-
sine of the angle between the vectors. This is
given by:
cos(~i,~j) =
~i ?~j
?~i ?? ~j ?
(2)
where i and j are vectors of the same pitch ac-
cent category and ? represents the dot prod-
uct.
Each comparison between vectors yields a
similarity score in the range [-1,1], where -1
represents high dissimilarity and 1 represents
high similarity.
The experiments that follow examine distribu-
tions of token similarity. In order to establish
whether distributions differ significantly two dif-
ferent levels of significance were employed, de-
pending on the number of pairwise comparisons
performed.
When comparing two distributions (i.e. per-
forming one test), the significance level was set to
? = 0.05. In those cases where multiple tests were
carried out (Experiment 1 and Experiment 3), the
level of significance was adjusted (Bonferroni cor-
rection) according to the following formula:
? = 1? (1? ?1)
1
n (3)
where ?1 represents the target significance level
(set to 0.05) and n represents the number of tests
being performed. The Bonferroni correction is of-
ten discussed controversially. The main criticism
concerns the increased likelihood of type II errors
that lead to non-significance of actually significant
findings (Pernegger, 1998). Although this conser-
vative adjustment was applied, the statistical tests
in this study resulted in significant p-values indi-
cating the robustness of the findings.
7 Experiment 1: Examining frequency of
occurrence effects in pitch accents
In accordance with the general methodology set
out in section 6, the PaIntE vectors of pitch ac-
cent tokens of types L?H, H?L, and H? were all
z-scored and, within each type, every token was
compared for similarity against every other token
of the same type, using the cosine of the angle be-
tween their vectors. In essence, this experiment
illustrates how similarly pitch accents of the same
type are realised.
Figure 1 depicts the results of the analysis. It
shows the density plot for each distribution of

distributions can be compared directly ? irrespec-
tive of the different number of data points.
An initial observation is that L?H tokens tend
to be realised fairly variably, the main portion
of the distribution is centred around zero. To-
kens of H?L tend to be produced more simi-
larly (i.e. the distribution is centred around a
higher similarity value), and tokens of H? more
similarly again. These three distributions were
tested against each other for significance using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (? = 0.017), yielding
p-values of p  0.001. Thus there are significant
differences between these distributions.
What is particularly noteworthy is that a de-
crease in frequency of occurrence across pitch ac-
cent types co-occurs significantly with an increase
in within-type token similarity.
While the differences between the graphed dis-
tributions do not appear to be highly marked
the frequency of occurrence effect is nevertheless
in keeping with exemplar-theoretic expectations
as posited by Bybee (2006) and Schweitzer and
Mo?bius (2004), that is, the high frequency of oc-
currence entails a large number of stored exem-
plars, giving the speaker the choice from among
a large number of production targets. This wider
choice leads to a broader range of chosen targets
for different productions and thus to more variable
realisations of tokens of the same type.

Walsh et al (2008) also reported significant
differences between these distributions, however,
there did not appear to be a clear frequency of oc-
currence effect. The results in the present study
differ from their results because the distributions
centre around different ranges of the similarity
scale clearly indicating that each accent type be-
haves differently in terms of similarity/variability
between the tokens of the respective type. The dif-
ferences between the two findings can be ascribed
to the augmented PaIntE model (section 4).
Given the results from this experiment, the next
experiment seeks to establish what relationship, if
any, exists between information status and pitch
accent production variability.
8 Experiment 2: Examining frequency of
occurrence effects in information
status categories
This experiment was carried out in the same man-
ner as Experiment 1 above with the exception that
in this experiment a subset of the corpus was em-
ployed: only syllables that were unambiguously
labelled with either the information status cate-
gory new or the category given were included in
the analyses. The experiment aims to investigate
the effect of information status on the similar-
ity/variability of tokens of different pitch accent
types. For each pitch accent type, tokens that were

were compared to tokens labelled as given. Again,
a pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied
for each comparison (? = 0.05). Figure 2 depicts
the results for H?L accents. The K-S test yielded a
highly significant difference between the two dis-
tributions (p  0.001), reflecting the clearly visi-
ble difference between the two curves. It is note-
worthy here that for H?L the information status
category new is more frequent than the category
given. Indeed, approximately twice as many are
labelled as new than those labelled given. Figure 2
illustrates that new H?L accents are realised more
variably than given ones. That is, again, an in-
crease in frequency of occurrence co-occurs with
an increase in similarity, this time at the level of
information status.
Figure 3 depicts the difference in similar-
ity/variability for L?H between new tokens and
given tokens. It is clearly visible that the two
curves do not differ as much as those under the
H?L condition. Both curves centre around zero re-
flecting the fact that for both types the tokens are
variable. Although the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
indicates significance (? = 0.05, p = 0.044), the
nature of the impact that information status has in
this case is unclear.
Here again an effect of frequency of occurrence
might be the reason for this result. The high fre-
quency of L?H accents in general results in a rel-
ative high frequency of given L?H tokens. So the

token number for both types is similar (102 new
L?H tokens vs. 114 given L?H tokens), there is
high frequency in both cases, hence variability.
These results, particularly in the case of H?L
(fig. 2) indicate that information status affects
pitch accent realisation. The next experiment
compares the effect across different pitch accent
types.
9 Experiment 3: Examining the effect of
information status across pitch accent
types
This experiment was carried out in the same man-
ner as Experiments 1 and 2 above. For each pitch
accent type, figure 4 depicts within-type pitch ac-
cent similarity for tokens unambiguously labelled
as new.
As with Experiments 1 and 2, frequency of
occurrence once more appears to play a signifi-
cant role. Again, all Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
yielded significant results (p < 0.017 in all cases).
Indeed, the difference between the distributions
of L?H, H?L, and H? similarity plots appears to
be considerably more prominent than in Experi-
ment 1 (see fig. 1). This indicates that under the
condition of novelty the frequency of occurrence
effect is more pronounced. In other words, there is
a considerably more noticeable difference across

elty is considered: novelty compounds the fre-
quency of occurrence effect.
Figure 5 illustrates results of the same analysis
methodology but applied to tokens of pitch accents
unambiguously labelled as given. Once again
there is a considerable difference between the dis-
tributions of L?H and H?L tokens (p < 0.017).
And again, this difference reflects a more pro-
nounced frequency of occurrence effect for given
tokens than for all accents pooled (as described
in Experiment 1): the information status category
given compounds the frequency of occurrence ef-
fect for L?H and H?L.
For H? the result is not as clear as for the two
more frequent accents. The comparison between
H? and L?H results in a significant difference
(p < 0.017) whereas the comparison between H?
and H?L is slightly above the conservative signif-
icance level (p = 0.0186). Moreover, the dis-
tribution is centred between the distributions for
L?H and H?L and it is thus not clear how to inter-
pret this result with respect to a possible frequency
of occurrence effect. However, having only ten
instances of given H?, the explanatory power of
these comparisons is questionable.
10 Discussion
The experiments discussed above yield a num-
ber of interesting results with implications for re-
search in prosody, information status, the interac-
tion between the two domains, and for exemplar
theory.
Returning to the first question posed at the out-
set in section 1, it is quite clear from Experiment 1
that a certain amount of variability exists when
different tokens of the same pitch accent type are
produced. It is also clear, from the same experi-
ment, that the frequency of occurrence of the pitch
accent type does indeed play a role: with an in-
crease in frequency comes an increase in vari-
ability. This result is in line with the exemplar-
theoretic view that since all exemplars are stored,
exemplars of a type that occur often are more vari-
able because they offer the speaker a wider se-
lection of exemplars to choose from during pro-
duction (Schweitzer and Mo?bius, 2004). How-
ever, with respect to entrenchment (Pierrehum-
bert, 2001; Bybee, 2006), i.e. the idea that fre-
quently occurring behaviours undergo processes
of entrenchment, in Experiment 1 one might ex-
pect to see greater similarity in the realisations of
L?H. However, it is important to note that while
tokens of L?H are not particularly similar to each
other (the bulk of the distribution is around zero
(see figure 1)), they are not too dissimilar either.
That is, they rest at the midpoint of the similar-
ity continuum produced by cosine calculation, in
quite a normal looking distribution. This is not
at odds with the idea of entrenchment. As pro-
ductions of a pitch accent type become more fre-
quent, the distribution of similarity spreads from
the right side of the graph (where infrequent and
highly similar H? tokens lie) leftwards (through
H?L) to the point where the L?H distribution is
found. Beyond this point tokens are excessively
different.
The second question posed in section 1, and ad-
dressed in Experiment 2, sought to ascertain the
impact, if any, information status has on pitch ac-
cent realisation. Distributions of given and new
H?L similarity scores differed significantly, as
did distributions of given and new L?H similar-
ity scores, indicating that information status af-
fects realisation. In other words, for both pitch
accent types, given and new tokens behave dif-
ferently. Concerning the frequency of occurrence

led to visually similar yet significantly different
distributions. Once again sensitivity to frequency
of occurrence seems to be present, in line with
exemplar-theoretic predictions.
The final question concerns the possibility of a
combined effect of pitch accent frequency of oc-
currence and information status frequency of oc-
currence. Figures 4 and 5 depict a clear com-
pounding effect of both information status cate-
gories across the different pitch accent types (and
their inherent frequencies) when compared to fig-
ure 1. Interestingly, the less frequently occurring
given appears to have a greater impact, particularly
on high frequency L?H.
Figure 6 displays all possible combinations of
L?H, H?L, given and new. H? is omitted in this
graph because of the small number of tokens (10
given, 21 new) and the resulting lack of explana-
tory power. It is evident that an overall frequency
of occurrence effect can be observed: ?given L?H?
and ?new L?H?, which have a similar number of
instances (114 vs. 102 tokens) both centre around
zero and are thus the most leftward skewed curves
in the graph. The distribution of ?new H?L? (87
tokens) shows a trend towards the right hand side
of the graph and thus represents greater similarity
of the tokens. The distribution of similarity values
for the least frequent combination of pitch accent
and information status, ?given H?L? (44 tokens),
centres between 0.5 and 1.0 and is thus the most
rightward curve in the graph, reflecting the high-
est similarity between the tokens.
These results highlight an intricate relationship
between pitch accent production and information
status. The information status of the word influ-
ences not only the type and shape of the pitch ac-
cent (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990; Bau-
mann, 2006; Ku?gler and Fe?ry, 2008; Schweitzer et
al., 2008) but also the similarity of tokens within a
pitch accent type. Moreover, this effect is well ex-
plainable within the framework of Exemplar The-
ory as it is subject to frequency of occurrence:
tokens of rare types are produced more similar to
each other than tokens of frequent types.
In the context of speech technology, unfortu-
nately the high variability in highly frequent pitch
accents has a negative consequence, as the correla-
tion between a certain pitch accent or a certain in-
formation status category and the F0 contour is not
a one-to-one relationship. However, forewarned
is forearmed and perhaps a finer grained contex-
tual analysis might yield more context specific so-
lutions.
11 Future Work
The methodology outlined in section 6 gives a lu-
cid insight into the levels of similarity found in
pitch accent realisations. Further insights, how-
ever, could be gleaned from a fine-grained exam-
ination of the PaIntE parameters. For example,
which parameters differ and under what conditions
when examining highly variable tokens? Informa-
tion status evidently plays a role in pitch accent
production but the contexts in which this takes
place have yet to be examined. In addition, the
role of information structure (focus-background,
contrast) also needs to be investigated. A further
line of research worth pursuing concerns the im-
pact of information status on the temporal struc-
ture of spoken utterances and possible compound-
ing with frequency of occurrence effects.

Abstract
An approach to automatic detection
of syllable structure is presented. We
demonstrate a novel application of
EM-based clustering to multivariate
data, exemplied by the induction
of 3- and 5-dimensional probabilis-
tic syllable classes. The qualitative
evaluation shows that the method
yields phonologically meaningful syl-
lable classes. We then propose a
novel approach to grapheme-to-pho-
neme conversion and show that syl-
lable structure represents valuable
information for pronunciation sys-
tems.
1 Introduction
In this paper we present an approach to un-
supervised learning and automatic detection
of syllable structure. The primary goal of
the paper is to demonstrate the application
of EM-based clustering to multivariate data.
The suitability of this approach is exemplied
by the induction of 3- and 5-dimensional prob-
abilistic syllable classes. A secondary goal is
to outline a novel approach to the conversion
of graphemes to phonemes (g2p) which uses a
context-free grammar (cfg) to generate all se-
quences of phonemes corresponding to a given
orthographic input word and then ranks the
hypotheses according to the probabilistic in-
formation coded in the syllable classes.
Our approach builds on two resources. The
rst resource is a cfg for g2p conversion that
was constructed manually by a linguistic ex-
pert (M?ller, 2000). The grammar describes
how words are composed of syllables and how
syllables consist of parts that are convention-
ally called onset, nucleus and coda, which in
turn are composed of phonemes, and corre-
sponding graphemes. The second resource
consists of a multivariate clustering algorithm
that is used to reveal syllable structure hid-
den in unannotated training data. In a rst
step, we collect syllables by going through a
large text corpus, looking up the words and
their syllabications in a pronunciation dictio-
nary and counting the occurrence frequencies
of the syllable types. Probabilistic syllable
classes are then computed by applying max-
imum likelihood estimation from incomplete
data via the EM algorithm. Two-dimensional
EM-based clustering has been applied to tasks
in syntax (Rooth et al, 1999), but so far this
approach has not been used to derive models
of higher dimensionality and, to the best of
our knowledge, this is the rst time that it
is being applied to speech. Accordingly, we
have trained 3- and 5-dimensional models for
English and German syllable structure.
The obtained models of syllable struc-
ture were evaluated in three ways. Firstly,
the 3-dimensional models were subjected to
a pseudo-disambiguation task, the result of
which shows that the onset is the most vari-
able part of the syllable. Secondly, the re-
sulting syllable classes were qualitatively eval-
uated from a phonological and phonotactic
point of view. Thirdly, a 5-dimensional syl-
lable model for German was tested in a g2p
conversion task. The results compare well
with the best currently available data-driven
approaches to g2p conversion (e.g., (Damper
et al, 1999)) and suggest that syllable struc-

Figure 2: Class #46 of a 5-dimensional German model with 50 classes
ture represents valuable information for pro-
nunciation systems. Such systems are critical
components in text-to-speech (TTS) conver-
sion systems, and they are also increasingly
used to generate pronunciation variants in au-
tomatic speech recognition.
The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2 we introduce the multi-
variate clustering algorithm. In Section 3 we
present four experiments based on 3- and 5-
dimensional data for German and English.
Section 4 is dedicated to evaluation and in
Section 5 we discuss our results.
2 Multivariate Syllable Clustering
EM-based clustering has been derived and ap-
plied to syntax (Rooth et al, 1999). Unfor-
tunately, this approach is not applicable to
multivariate data with more than two dimen-
sions. However, we consider syllables to con-
sist of at least three dimensions correspond-
ing to parts of the internal syllable structure:
onset, nucleus and coda. We have also experi-
mented with 5-dimensional models by adding
two more dimensions: position of the sylla-
ble in the word and stress status. In our
multivariate clustering approach, classes cor-
responding to syllables are viewed as hidden
data in the context of maximum likelihood es-
timation from incomplete data via the EM al-
gorithm. The two main tasks of EM-based
clustering are (i) the induction of a smooth
probability model on the data, and (ii) the
automatic discovery of class structure in the
data. Both aspects are considered in our ap-
plication. We aim to derive a probability
distribution p(y) on syllables y from a large
sample. The key idea is to view y as condi-
tioned on an unobserved class c 2 C, where
the classes are given no prior interpretation.
The probability of a syllable y = (y
1
; ::; y
d
) 2
Y
1
 ::  Y
d
; d  3; is dened as:
p(y) =

p(c; y) =

c2C
p(c)p(yjc)
=
X
c2C
p(c)
d
Y
i=1
p(y

Note that conditioning of y
i
on each other is
solely made through the classes c via the in-
dependence assumption p(yjc) =
Q
d
i=1
p(y
i
jc).
This assumption makes clustering feasible in
the rst place; later on (in Section 4.1) we
will experimentally determine the number jCj
of classes such that the assumption is opti-
mally met. The EM algorithm (Dempster et
al., 1977) is directed at maximizing the incom-
plete data log-likelihood L =
P
y
~p(y) ln p(y)
as a function of the probability distribution
p for a given empirical probability distribu-
tion ~p. Our application is an instance of the
EM-algorithm for context-free models (Baum
et al, 1970), from which simple re-estimation
formulae can be derived. Let f(y) the fre-
quency of syllable y, and jf j =
P
y2Y
f(y)
the total frequency of the sample (i.e. ~p(y) =
f(y)
jf j
), and f
c
(y) = f(y)p(cjy) the estimated
frequency of y annotated with c. Parameter
updates p^(c); p^(y
i
jc) can thus be computed by
(c 2 C; y

As shown by Baum et al (1970), every such
maximization step increases the log-likelihood

eventually converges to a (local) maximum.
3 Experiments
A sample of syllables serves as input to the
multivariate clustering algorithm. The Ger-
man data were extracted from the Stuttgarter
Zeitung (STZ), a newspaper corpus of about
31 million words. The English data came from
the British National Corpus (BNC), a col-
lection of written and spoken language con-
taining about 100 million words. For both
languages, syllables were collected by going
through the corpus, looking up the words and
their syllabications in a pronunciation dictio-
nary (Baayen et al, 1993)
1
and counting the
occurrence frequencies of the syllable types
2
.
1
We slightly modied the English pronunciation
lexicon to obtain non-empty nuclei, e.g. /ideal-
ism/ [aI][dI@][lIzm,] was modied to [aI][dI@][lI][z@m]
(SAMPA transcription).
2
Subsequent experiments on syllable types (M?ller
et al, 2000) have shown that frequency counts repre-
sent valuable information for our clustering task.
In two experiments, we induced 3-dimensional
models based on syllable onset, nucleus, and
coda. We collected 9327 distinct German syl-
lables and 13,598 distinct English syllables.
The number of syllable classes was system-
atically varied in iterated training runs and
ranged from 1 to 200.
Figure 1 shows a selected segment of class
#0 from a 3-dimensional English model with
12 classes. The rst column displays the class
index 0 and the class probability p(0). The
most probable onsets and their probabilities
are listed in descending order in the second
column, as are nucleus and coda in the third
and fourth columns, respectively. Empty on-
sets and codas were labeled NOP[nucleus].
Class #0 contains the highly frequent func-
tion words in, is, it, its as well as the suxes
-ing ,-ting, -ling. Notice that these function
words and suxes appear to be separated in
the 5-dimensional model (classes #1 and #3
in Figure 3).
In two further experiments, we induced 5-
dimensional models, augmented by the addi-
tional parameters of position of the syllable in
the word and stress status. Syllable position
has four values: monosyllabic (ONE), initial
(INI), medial (MED), and nal (FIN). Stress

Figure 4: Evaluation on pseudo-disambiguation task for English (left) and German (right)
has two values: stressed (STR) and unstressed
(USTR). We collected 16,595 distinct German
syllables and 24,365 distinct English syllables.
The number of syllable classes ranged from 1
to 200. Figure 2 illustrates (part of) class #46
from a 5-dimensional German model with 50
classes. Syllable position and stress are dis-
played in the last two columns.
4 Evaluation
In the following sections, (i) the 3-dimen-
sional models are subjected to a pseudo-
disambiguation task (4.1); (ii) the syllable
classes are qualitatively evaluated (4.2); and
(iii) the 5-dimensional syllable model for Ger-
man is tested in a g2p task (4.3).
4.1 Pseudo-Disambiguation
We evaluated our 3-dimensional cluster-
ing models on a pseudo-disambiguation
task similar to the one described by
Rooth et al (1999), but specied to onset,
nucleus, and coda ambiguity. The rst task
is to judge which of two onsets on and on
0
is more likely to appear in the context of a
given nucleus n and a given coda cod. For this
purpose, we constructed an evaluation cor-
pus of 3000 syllables (on; n; cod) selected from
the original data. Then, randomly chosen on-
sets on
0
were attached to all syllables in the
evaluation corpus, with the resulting syllables
(on
0
; n; cod) appearing neither in the training
nor in the evaluation corpus. Furthermore,
the elements on; n; cod, and on
0
were required
to be part of the training corpus.
Clustering models were parameterized in
(up to 10) starting values of EM-training, in
the number of classes of the model (up to
200), resulting in a sequence of 10  20 mod-
els. Accuracy was calculated as the number
of times the model decided p(on; n; cod) 
p(on
0
; n; cod) for all choices made. Two simi-
lar tasks were designed for nucleus and coda.
Results for the best starting values are
shown in Figure 4. Models of 12 classes
show the highest accuracy rates. For German
we reached accuracy rates of 88-90% (nucleus
and coda) and 77% (onset). For English we
achieved accuracy rates of 92% (coda), 84%
(nucleus), and 76% (onset). The results of
the pseudo-disambiguation agree with intu-
ition: in both languages (i) the onset is the
most variable part of the syllable, as it is easy
to nd minimal pairs that vary in the onset,
(ii) it is easier to predict the coda and nucleus,
as their choice is more restricted.
4.2 Qualitative Evaluation
The following discussion is restricted to the 5-
dimensional syllable models, as the quality of
the output increased when more dimensions
were added. We can look at the results from
dierent angles. For instance, we can verify
if any of the classes are mainly representa-
tives of a syllable class pertinent to a par-
ticular nucleus (as it is the case with the 3-
dimensional models). Another interesting as-
pect is whether there are syllable classes that
represent parts of lexical content words, as op-
posed to high-frequency function words. Fi-
nally, some syllable classes may correspond to
productive axes.

Figure 5: Classes #4, #7, #26, #34, #40 of the 5-dimensional German model
German. The majority of syllable classes
obtained for German is dominated by one par-
ticular nucleus per syllable class. In 24 out of
50 classes the probability of the dominant nu-
cleus is greater than 99%, and in 9 cases it is
indeed 100%. The only syllable nuclei that do
not dominate any class are the front rounded
vowels /y:, Y, 2:, 9/, the front vowel /E:/ and
the diphthong /OY/, all of which are among
the least frequently occurring nuclei in the lex-
icon of German. Figure 5 depicts the classes
that will be discussed now.
Almost one third (28%) of the 50 classes
are representatives of high-frequency function
words. For example, class #7 is dominated by
the function words in, ich, ist, im, sind, sich,
all of which contain the short vowel /I/.
Another 32% of the 50 classes represents
syllables that are most likely to occur in ini-
tial, medial and nal positions in the open
word classes of the lexicon, i.e. nouns, ad-
jectives, and verbs. Class #4 covers several
lexical entries involving the diphthong /aI/
mostly in stressed word-initial syllables. Class
#40 provides complimentary information, as
it also includes syllables containing /aI/, but
here mostly in word-medial position.
We also observe syllable classes that repre-
sent productive prexes (e.g., ver-, er-, zer-,
vor-, her- in class #26) and suxes (e.g.,
-lich, -ig in class #34). Finally, there are
two syllable classes (not displayed) that cover
the most common inectional suxes involv-
ing the vowel /@/ (schwa).
Class numbers are informative insofar as
the classes are ranked by decreasing proba-
bility. Lower-ranked classes tend (i) not to
be dominated by one nucleus; (ii) to contain
vowels with relatively low frequency of occur-
rence; and (iii) to yield less clear patterns in
terms of word class or stress or position. For
illustration, class #46 (Figure 2) represents
the syllable ent [Ent], both as a prex (INI)
and as a sux (FIN), the former being un-
stressed (as in Entwurf design) and the lat-
ter stressed (as in Dirigent conductor).
English. In 24 out of the 50 syllable classes
obtained for English one dominant nucleus per
syllable class is observed. In all of these cases
the probability of the nucleus is larger than
99% and in 7 classes the nucleus probability is
100%. Besides several diphthongs only the rel-
atively infrequent vowels /V/, /A:/ and /3:/
do not dominate any class. Figure 3 shows
the classes that are described as follows.
High-frequency function words are repre-
sented by 10 syllable classes. For example,
class #0 and #17 and are dominated by the
determiners the and a, respectively, and class
#1 contains function words that involve the
short vowel /I/, such as in, is, it, his, if, its.
Productive word-forming suxes are found
in class #3 (-ing), and common inectional
suxes in class #4 (-er, -es, -ed). Class #10

Figure 6: An incorrect (left) and a correct (right) cfg analysis of L?tzinn
is particularly interesting in that it represents
a comparably large number of common suf-
xes, such as -tion, -ment, -al, -ant, -ent, -
ence and others.
The majority of syllable classes, viz. 31 out
of 50, contains syllables that are likely to be
found in initial, medial and nal positions in
the open word classes of the lexicon. For ex-
ample, class #14 represents mostly stressed
syllables involving the vowels /eI, A:, e:, O:/
and others, in a variety of syllable positions in
nouns, adjectives or verbs.
4.3 Evaluation by g2p Conversion
In this section, we present a novel method
of g2p conversion (i) using a cfg to produce
all possible phonemic correspondences of a
given grapheme string, (ii) applying a prob-
abilistic syllable model to rank the pronunci-
ation hypotheses, and (iii) predicting pronun-
ciation by choosing the most probable anal-
ysis. We used a cfg for generating transcrip-
tions, because grammars are expressive and
writing grammar-rules is easy and intuitive.
Our grammar describes how words are com-
posed of syllables and syllables branch into
onset, nucleus and coda. These syllable parts
are re-written by the grammar as sequences
of natural phone classes, e.g. stops, frica-
tives, nasals, liquids, as well as long and
short vowels, and diphthongs. The phone
classes are then re-interpreted as the individ-
ual phonemes that they are made up of. Fi-
nally, for each phoneme all possible graphemic
correspondences are listed.
Figure 6 illustrates two analyses (out of
100) of the German word L?tzinn (tin sol-
der). The phoneme strings (represented by
non-terminals named phon=...) and the
syllable boundaries (represented by the non-
terminal Syl) can be extracted from these
analyses. Figure 6 depicts both an incor-
rect analysis [l2:ts][i:n] and its correct coun-
terpart [l2:t][tsIn]. The next step is to rank
these transcriptions by assigning probabilities
to them. The key idea is to take the prod-
uct of the syllable probabilities. Using the 5-
dimensional
3
German syllable model yields a
probability of 7:5 10
 7
3:1 10
 7
= 2:3 10
 13
for the incorrect analysis and a probability of
1:510
 7
6:510
 6
= 9:810
 13
for the correct
one. Thus we achieve the desired result of as-
signing the higher probability to the correct
transcription.
We evaluated our g2p system on a test set
of 1835 unseen words. The ambiguity ex-
pressed as the average number of analyses per
word was 289. The test set was constructed
by collecting 295,102 words from the German
Celex dictionary (Baayen et al, 1993) that
were not seen in the STZ corpus. From this
set we manually eliminated (i) foreign words,
(ii) acronyms, (iii) proper names, (iv) verbs,
and (v) words with more than three syllables.
The resulting test set is available on the World
Wide Web

5 Discussion
We have presented an approach to unsuper-
vised learning and automatic detection of syl-
lable structure, using EM-based multivariate
clustering. The method yields phonologically
meaningful syllable classes. These classes are
shown to represent valuable input information
in a g2p conversion task.
In contrast to the application of two-
dimensional EM-based clustering to syntax
(Rooth et al, 1999), where semantic rela-
tions were revealed between verbs and objects,
the syllable models cannot a priori be ex-
pected to yield similarly meaningful proper-
ties. This is because the syllable constituents
(or phones) represent an inventory with a
small number of units which can be combined
to form meaningful larger units, viz. mor-
phemes and words, but which do not them-
selves carry meaning. Thus, there is no reason
why certain syllable types should occur signif-
icantly more often than others, except for the
fact that certain morphemes and words have a
higher frequency count than others in a given
text corpus. As discussed in Section 4.2, how-
ever, we do nd some interesting properties
of syllable classes, some of which apparently
represent high-frequency function words and
productive axes, while others are typically
found in lexical content words. Subjected to
5
45 resp. 95 words could not be disambiguated
by the 3- resp. 5-dimensional empirical distributions.
The reported relatively small gains can be explained
by the fact that our syllable models were applied only
to this small number of ambiguous words.
a pseudo-disambiguation task (Section 4.1),
the 3-dimensional models conrm the intu-
ition that the onset is the most variable part
of the syllable.
In a feasibility study we applied the 5-
dimensional syllable model obtained for Ger-
man to a g2p conversion task. Automatic
conversion of a string of characters, i.e. a
word, into a string of phonemes, i.e. its pro-
nunciation, is essential for applications such
as speech synthesis from unrestricted text in-
put, which can be expected to contain words
that are not in the system's pronunciation
dictionary or otherwise unknown to the sys-
tem. The main purpose of the feasibility
study was to demonstrate the relevance of the
phonological information on syllable structure
for g2p conversion. Therefore, information
and probabilities derived from an alignment
of grapheme and phoneme strings, i.e. the
lowest two levels in the trees displayed in Fig-
ure 6, was deliberately ignored. Data-driven
pronunciation systems usually rely on training
data that include an alignment of graphemes
and phonemes. Damper et al (1999) have
shown that the use of unaligned training data
signicantly reduces the performance of g2p
systems. In our experiment, with training
on unannotated text corpora and without an
alignment of graphemes and phonemes, we ob-
tained a word accuracy rate of 75.3% for the
5-dimensional German syllable model.
Comparison of this performance with other
systems is dicult: (i) hardly any quantita-
tive g2p performance data are available for
German; (ii) comparisons across languages are
hard to interpret; (iii) comparisons across dif-
ferent approaches require cautious interpreta-
tions. The most direct point of comparison
is the method presented by M?ller (2000). In
one of her experiments, the standard prob-
ability model was applied to the hand-crafted
cfg presented in this paper, yielding 42% word
accuracy as evaluated on our test set. Run-
ning the test set through the pronunciation
rule system of the IMS German Festival TTS
system (M?hler, 1999) resulted in 55% word
accuracy. The Bell Labs German TTS sys-
tem (M?bius, 1999) performed at better than
94% word accuracy on our test set. This TTS
system relies on an annotation of morpho-
logical structure for the words in its lexicon
and it performs a morphological analysis of
unknown words (M?bius, 1998); the pronun-
ciation rules draw on this structural infor-
mation. These comparative results emphasize
the value of phonotactic knowledge and infor-
mation on syllable structure and morphologi-
cal structure for g2p conversion.
In a comparison across languages, a word
accuracy rate of 75.3% for our 5-dimensional
German syllable model is slightly higher than
the best data-driven method for English with
72% (Damper et al, 1999). Recently, Bouma
(2000) has reported a word accuracy of 92.6%
for Dutch, using a `lazy' training strategy on
data aligned with the correct phoneme string,
and a hand-crafted system that relied on a
large set of rule templates and a many-to-one
mapping of characters to graphemes preceding
the actual g2p conversion.
We are condent that a judicious combina-
tion of phonological information of the type
employed in our feasibility study with stan-
dard techniques such as g2p alignment of
training data will produce a pronunciation
system with a word accuracy that matches
the one reported by Bouma (2000). We be-
lieve, however, that for an optimally perform-
ing system as is desired for TTS, an even
more complex design will have to be adopted.
In many languages, including English, Ger-
man and Dutch, access to morphological and
phonological information is required to reli-
ably predict the pronunciation of words; this
view is further evidenced by the performance
of the Bell Labs system, which relies on pre-
cisely this type of information. We agree with
Sproat (1998, p. 77) that it is unrealistic to ex-
pect optimal results from a system that has no
access to this type of information or is trained
on data that are insucient for the task.
