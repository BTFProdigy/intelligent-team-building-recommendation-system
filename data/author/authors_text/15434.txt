Abstract
Numerical information is very common in
all kinds of documents from newspapers and
magazines to household bills and wage slips.
However, many people find it difficult to un-
derstand, particularly people with poor educa-
tion and disabilities. Sometimes numerical in-
formation is presented with hedges that mod-
ify the meaning. A numerical hedge is a word
or phrase employed to indicate explicitly that
some loss of precision has taken place (e.g.,
?around?) and it may also indicate the di-
rection of approximation (e.g., ?more than?).
This paper presents a study of the use of nu-
merical hedges that is part of research inves-
tigating the process of rewriting difficult nu-
merical expressions in simpler ways. We car-
ried out a survey in which experts in numer-
acy were asked to simplify a range of pro-
portion expressions and analysed the results to
obtain guidelines for automating the simplifi-
cation task.
1 Introduction
All public information services and documents
should be accessible in such a way that makes them
easily understood by everybody, according to the
United Nations (1994). Nowadays, a large percent-
age of information expressed in daily news comes
in the form of numerical expressions (statistics of
economy, demography data, etc). But many people
have problems with understanding such expressions
-e.g., people with limited education or some kind of
mental disability.
Lack of ability to understand numerical informa-
tion is an even greater problem than poor literacy.
A U.K. Government Survey in 2003 estimated that
6.8 million adults had insufficient numeracy skills
to perform simple everyday tasks such as paying
house-hold bills and understanding wage slips, and
23.8 million adults would be unable to achieve grade
C in the GCSE maths examination for 16 year-old
school children (Williams et al, 2003).
A first possible approach to solve this impor-
tant social problem is making numerical informa-
tion accessible by rewriting difficult numerical ex-
pressions using alternative wordings that are easier
to understand. Some loss of precision could have
positive advantages for numerate people as well as
less numerate. Such an approach would require a
set of rewriting strategies yielding expressions that
are linguistically correct, easier to understand than
the original, and as close as possible to the original
meaning.
In rewriting, hedges play an important role. For
example,?50.9%? could be rewritten as ?just over
half? using the hedge ?just over?. In this kind of
simplification, hedges indicate that the original num-
ber has been approximated and, in some cases, also
the direction of approximation.
This paper presents a preliminary study of the use
of hedges when numerical expressions are simplified
to make them more accessible. We have carried out
a survey in which experts in numeracy were asked to
simplify a range of proportion expressions to obtain
guidelines for developing the numerical expressions
simplification task automatically. As a first step to-
wards more complex simplification strategies, we
128
are trying to simplify numerical expressions without
losing substantial information. Our study does not
have a particular kind of disability in mind. Rather,
we aim to simplify according to levels of difficulty
defined in the Mathematics Curriculum of the Quali-
fications and Curriculum Authority (1999). Adapta-
tion to particular types of users is beyond the scope
of this paper.
2 Background
Text simplification, a relative new task in Natu-
ral Language Processing, has been directed mainly
at syntactic constructions and lexical choices that
some readers find difficult, such as long sentences,
passives, coordinate and subordinate clauses, ab-
stract words, low frequency words, and abbrevia-
tions. Chandrasekar et al (1996) introduced a two-
stage process, first transforming from sentence to
syntactic tree, then from syntactic tree to new sen-
tence; Siddharthan (2002) instead proposed a three-
stage process comprising analysis, transformation
and generation. In 1998, the project PSET (Car-
roll et al, 1998) employed lexical as well as syn-
tactic simplifications. Other researchers have fo-
cused on the generation of readable texts for readers
with low basic skills (Williams and Reiter, 2005),
and for teaching foreign languages (Petersen and
Ostendorf, 2007). There has been some previous
work on numerical expressions but more for experts
than for people who have difficulties with numer-
acy (Ellen Peters and Dieckmann, 2007), (Nathan
F. Dieckmann and Peters, 2009), (Ann M. Bisantz
and Munch, 2005), (Mishra H, 2011). However,
to our knowledge, there have been no previous at-
tempts to automatically simplify numerical informa-
tion in texts.
A corpus of numerical expressions was collected
for the NUMGEN project (Williams and Power,
2009). The corpus contains 10 sets of newspaper ar-
ticles and scientific papers (110 texts in total). Each
set is a collection of articles on the same topic ?
e.g., the increased risk of breast cancer in red meat
eaters, and the decline in the puffin population on
the Isle of May. Within each set, identical numeri-
cal facts are presented in a variety of linguistic and
mathematical forms.
3 Experiment
Our survey took the form of a questionnaire in
which participants were shown a sentence contain-
ing one or more numerical expressions which they
were asked to simplify using hedges if necessary.
3.1 Materials
Our simplification strategies are focused at two lev-
els: decimal percentages and whole-number per-
centages. For the survey we chose three sets of can-
didate sentences from the NUMGEN corpus: eight
sentences containing only decimal percentages and
two sets of eight sentences containing mixed whole-
number and decimal percentages. The number of
numerical expressions are more than eight because
some sentences contained more than one proportion
expression.
A wide spread of proportion values was present in
each set, including the two end points at nearly 0.0
and almost 1.0. We also included some numerical
expressions with hedges and sentences from differ-
ent topics in the corpus. In short, we included as
many variations in context, precision and different
wordings as possible.
3.2 Participants
We carried out the survey with primary or secondary
school mathematics teachers or adult basic numer-
acy tutors, all native English speakers. We found
them through personal contacts and posts to Inter-
net forums. The task of simplifying numerical ex-
pressions is difficult, but it is a task that this group
seemed well qualified to tackle since they are highly
numerate and accustomed to talking to people who
do not understand mathematical concepts very well.
Our experimental evaluation involved 34 partici-
pants who answered at least one question in our sur-
vey (some participants did not complete it).
3.3 Survey Design and Implementation
The survey was divided into three parts as follows:
1. Simplification of numerical expressions for a
person who can not understand percentages
2. Simplification of numerical expressions for a
person who can not understand decimals
129
3. Free simplification of numerical expressions
for a person with poor numeracy
Each part of the survey is considered as a differ-
ent kind of simplification: (1) simplification with no
percentages, (2) simplification with no decimals and
(3) free simplification.
For part (2), the set of sentences containing only
decimal percentages was used. One of the two
mixed sets of sentences with whole-number and
decimal percentages was used for part (1) and the
other for part (3). The experiment was presented on
SurveyMonkey1, a commonly-used provider of web
surveys. The survey was configured so that partic-
ipants could leave the questionnaire and later con-
tinue with it.
We asked participants to provide simplifications
for numerical expressions that were marked by
square brackets in each sentence. Below the sen-
tence, each bracketed number was shown beside a
text box in which the participant was asked to type
the simplified version. Our instructions said that nu-
merical expressions could be simplified using any
format: number words, digits, fractions, ratios, etc.
and that hedges such as ?more than?, ?almost? and
so on could be introduced if necessary. Participants
were also told that the meaning of the simplified ex-
pression should be as close to the original expres-
sion as possible and that, if necessary, they could
rewrite part of the original sentence. Figure 1 shows
a screenshot of part of the questionnaire.
3.4 Underlying assumptions
A numerical expression (NE) is considered to be a
phrase that represents a quantity, sometimes modi-
fied by a numerical hedge as in ?less than a quarter?
or ?about 20%?. We have restricted coverage to pro-
portions -i.e., fractions, ratios and percentages. We
had five hypotheses:
? H1: The use of hedges to accompany the sim-
plified numerical expression is influenced by
the simplification strategy selected. We con-
sider the use of fractions, ratios and percent-
ages like simplification strategies.
? H2: The use of hedges to simplify the numeri-
cal expression is influenced by the value of the
1www.surveymonkey.com
proportion, with values in the central range (say
0.2 to 0.8) and values at the extreme ranges (say
0.0-0.2 and 0.8-1.0) having a different use of
hedges.
? H3: The loss of precision allowed for the sim-
plified numerical expression is influenced by
the simplification strategy selected.
? H4: There is some kind of correlation between
the loss of precision and the use of hedges, in
such a way that the increase or decrease in the
former influences changes in the latter.
? H5: As an specific case of H4, when writers
choose numerical expressions for readers with
low numeracy, they do not tend to use hedges if
they are not losing precision.
4 Results
The results of the survey were carefully analyzed as
follows. First, within each block of questions, a set
of simplification strategies was identified for each
specific numerical expression. These strategies were
then grouped together according to the mathematical
forms and/or linguistic expressions employed (frac-
tions, ratios, percentages).
With a view to using these data to design an au-
tomated simplification system, these data have to be
analyzed in terms of pairs of a given input numeri-
cal expression and the simplified expression result-
ing from applying a specific simplification strategy.
For such pairings, three important features must be
considered as relevant to choosing a realization:
? Whether any numbers in the expression are re-
alized as one of the different types of available
expressions (fractions, ratios, percentages).
? The loss of precision involved in the simplifi-
cation.
? The possible use of a hedge to cover this loss
of precision explicitly in the simplified expres-
sion.
To calculate the loss of precision, we defined
Equation 1.

Figure 1: Screenshot of part of the questionnaire.
The set of pairings of input expression and ob-
served simplification strategies, loss of precision and
use of hedges as found in the results of the survey is
given in Tables 1, 2 and 3. For each input numer-
ical expression, the set of available simplification
strategies is represented as three lines in the table.
For each pairing, three columns are shown in the
table. Empty cells represent that the strategy was
not used. The first column presents the relative fre-
quency of usage with respect to the total set of possi-
ble simplification strategies used for that expression.
The second column captures the loss of precision in-
volved, represented in terms of the ratio between the
value of the difference between the original numer-
ical value in the input expression and the numerical
value that is conveyed by the corresponding simpli-
fied expression (using Equation 1). This ratio is also
expressed as a percentage. The third column indi-
cates the percentage of simplified numerical expres-
sions that contained a hedge. All of them are mean
values.
Each line represents one kind of simplification
strategy used to simplify the original numerical ex-
pression. Another point to explain is that frequen-
cies that belong to the same expression do not al-
ways add up to 100%. This is because a small num-
ber of others kinds of simplification strategies, like
deletions or rewriting of the whole sentence, are not
shown in the table. Moreover, we must keep in mind
that not all participants answered each question of
the survey.
Table 1 presents the relationships identified be-
tween the original numerical expressions and the
simplification strategies (presented as lines) for the
results of the first part of the survey (simplification
of numerical expressions for a person who can not
understand percentages). All the values are repre-
sented in percentages. Table 2 represents the same
data for the second part of the survey (simplification
of numerical expressions for a person who can not
understand decimals) and Table 3 for the third part
(free simplification of numerical expressions for a
person with poor numeracy).
In the three parts of the survey, the percentage of
simplifications that use hedges is slightly higher than
that of those not using hedges especially in the sec-
ond and third part of the survey. Adapting original
numerical expressions by inserting hedges accounts
for more than the 50% of cases. This reinforces
our assumption that simplifications involving loss of
precision may be better understood if an appropriate
hedge is used.
4.1 Analysis of the Use of Hedges in the
Simplified Numerical Expressions
In order to test hypothesis H1 (the use of hedges
in the simplified numerical expression is influenced
by the simplification strategy selected), we carried
out a series of two sample t-tests where statistical
significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons
by using the Bonferroni correction. Results are pre-
sented in Table 4. When considering the entire sur-
vey (Whole column), there is no significant differ-
ence in the use of hedges in fractions and percent-
ages. When analyzing the survey by parts we find
similar results. There is no significant difference in
the use of hedges in any strategy in the second (no
decimals) and the third (free simplification) parts of

find significant difference between fractions and ra-
tios (p<0.0006). These results do not support the
hypothesis, as there is not a direct relation between
the use of hedges and the selected strategy.
We performed another t-test adjusted by using the
Bonferroni correction on the simplification strate-
gies and central and peripheral values to test hypoth-
esis H2 (the use of hedges to simplify the numerical
expression is influenced by the value of the propor-
tion, with values in the central range (say 0.2 to 0.8)
and values at the extreme ranges (say 0.0-0.2 and
0.8-1.0) having a different use of hedges). In this
case there is also no significant difference. The re-
sults show that the use of hedges is not influenced by
central and peripheral values, rejecting our hypoth-
esis H2 with a p-value p=0.77 in the worst case for
the percentages strategy.

no significant difference between any strategy. And
in the last part (free simplification) there is only a
significant difference between fractions and ratios.
These results seem not to support the hypothesis,
as there is not a direct relation between the use of
hedges and the loss of precision in the simplified nu-
merical expression.
For hypothesis H4 (there is some kind of corre-
lation between the loss of precision and the use of
hedges), we looked for correlations between each
part of the survey and each kind of simplification
strategy. We carried out a non-parametric measure
of statistical dependence between the two variables
(loss of precision and use of hedges) calculated by
the Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient.
In general, the results show no correlation, so
there is no linear dependence between the loss of
precision in the strategy and use of hedges, rejecting
our hypothesis. For example, there are cases with
a weak correlation (e.g. in the second part of the
survey for fractions with r=0.49, N=17 and p=0.03),
and cases where there is a strong correlation (e.g.
in the third part of the survey, with r=1, N=18 and
p<.0001).
Finally, when we analyzed hypothesis H5 (when
writers choose numerical expressions for readers
with low numeracy, they do not tend to use hedges if
they are not losing precision), we worked with each
part of the survey to study the cases where the loss
of precision is zero and what is the tendency of use
of hedges.
? In the first part of the survey (simplification
of numerical expressions for a person who can
not understand percentages), considering our
34 participants, in a 46% of responses the loss
of precision is zero, and for these cases only
11% used hedges.
? For the second part (simplification of numeri-
cal expressions for a person who can not un-
derstand decimals), considering our 34 partici-
pants, in a 16% of responses the loss of preci-
sion is zero and for these cases only 7% used
hedges.
? And finally, in the last part (simplification of
numerical expressions for a person with poor
numeracy), considering the same participants,
in a 23% of cases the loss of precision is zero
in the simplification and for these cases only
6% used hedges.
With this data, it seems that we can accept hypoth-
esis H5, that is, we found evidence for our assump-
tion that when writers choose numerical expressions
for readers with poor numeracy, they tend to use
hedges when they round the original numerical ex-
pression, i.e when the loss of precision is not zero.
4.2 Original Numerical Expressions with
Hedges
In our survey there were a few cases where the orig-
inal numerical expression had a hedge. We have
observed that if the original numerical expression
has hedge almost always the simplified numerical
expression contained a hedge. There is a special
case, ?above 97%? where we do not count the use
of hedges because in this case the participants chose
non-numeric options mostly and they rewrote the
numerical expression with phrases like ?around all?.

In the remaining cases, the same hedge is nearly al-
way chosen to simplify the numerical expression.
4.3 Kinds of Hedges
With respect to the actual hedges used, we have
identified two different possible roles of hedge in-
gredients in a numerical expression. In some cases,
hedges are used to indicate that the actual numeri-
cal value given is an approximation to the intended
value. Uses of about or around are instances of this.
This kind of hedge is employed to indicate explic-
itly that some loss of precision has taken place dur-
ing simplification. In other cases, hedges are used to
indicate the direction in which the simplified value
diverges from the original value. Uses of under or
over are instances of this. In some cases more than
one hedge may be added to an expression to indi-
cate both approximation and direction, or to some-
how specify the precision involved in the simplifica-
tion, as in just under or a little less than.
In our analysis we studied which hedges were
the most frequent in each part of the survey. Only
hedges with more than ten appearances in total (in-
cluding simplification strategies not present in the
table) have been considered in Table 6. We observed
that the three parts of the survey have three hedges
in common: about, just over and over. They are
used in different strategies for each kind of simpli-
fication. In the second part of the survey, where
simplifications of numerical expressions for a per-
son who can not understand decimals are done, is
where more hedges are used, in special for percent-
ages strategy. In the last part of the survey, where
there is more freedom to decide how simplify the
original numerical expression, participants used less
hedges compare to the others parts.

5 Discussion
As can be seen in the results, the use of hedges to
simplify numerical expressions can be influenced by
three parameters. The first is the kind of simplifica-
tion. Our survey was divided in three parts depend-
ing on the mathematical knowledge of the final user.
The second is the simplification strategy for choos-
ing mathematical form (fractions, ratios, or percent-
ages). In our data we observed some differences in
the usage of hedges with ratios and their usage with
fractions and percentages (see Table 4). The last pa-
rameter is the loss of precision that occurs when the
numerical expression is rounded. We investigated
the use of hedges vs. loss of precision with different
tests hoping to define some dependencies, but there
was no clear correlation between them, and it was
only when we tried a deeper analysis of strategies
and kind of simplifications that we found some cor-
relations such as those we presented in Section 4.1.
When asked to simplify for people who do not
understand percentages, or for people with poor nu-
meracy, the participants use different simplification
strategies and sometimes they use hedges to simplify
the original numerical expression. As some partic-
ipants commented, not only are percentages mathe-
matically sophisticated forms, but they may be used
in sophisticated ways in the text, often for example
describing rising and falling values, for which in-
creases or decreases can themselves be described in
percentages terms. Such complex relationships are
likely to pose problems for people with poor numer-
acy even if a suitable strategy can be found for sim-
plifying the individual percentages. In some of the
examples with more than one numerical expression
being compared, some of the evaluators reported a
tendency to phrase them both according to a com-
parable base. Thus we should consider the role of
context (the set of numerical expressions in a given
sentence as a whole, and the meaning of the text) in
establishing what simplifications must be used.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
Through a survey administered to experts on nu-
meracy, we have collected a wide range of exam-
ples of appropriate simplifications of percentage ex-
pressions. These examples of simplified expressions
give us information about the use of hedges that our
participants carry out to adapt the original numer-
ical expression to be understood by the final user.
We investigated the loss of precision that occurs with
each hedge and the relation between the simplifica-
tion strategy and the use of hedges.
Our aim is to use this data to guide the develop-
ment of a system for automatically simplifying per-
centages in texts. With the knowledge acquired from
our study we will improve our algorithm to simplify
numerical expressions. We could determinate from
the simplification strategy, kind of simplification and
the loss of precision allowed, which will be the best
option to adapt the original numerical expression to
the final user and if that option uses hedges to under-
stand better the original numerical expression. As a
part of our algorithm, we will have to look at inter-
rater agreements for identifying appropriate hedges.
As future work, we plan to carry out another study
to determine a ranking of simplification strategies
from collecting a repertoire of rewriting strategies
used to simplify. This data should allow us to deter-
mine whether common values are considered sim-
pler and whether the value of the original expression
influences the chosen simplification strategy. So,
given a numerical expression, we could choose what
simplification strategy to apply and whether to insert
a hedge. We could investigate whether the value of
the original proportion also influences choices, de-
pending on its correspondence with central or pe-
ripheral values.
We have also collected a parallel corpus of numer-
ical expressions (original vs. simplified version).
This corpus will be shared with other researches so
it can be used in different applications to improve
the readability of text. This could be a very use-
ful resource because simplification of percentages
remains an interesting and non-trivial problem.

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to motivate and
describe a system that simplifies numerical
expression in texts, along with an evaluation
study in which experts in numeracy and liter-
acy assessed the outputs of this system. We
have worked with a collection of newspaper
articles with a significant number of numerical
expressions. The results are discussed in com-
parison to conclusions obtained from a prior
empirical survey.
1 Introduction
A surprisingly large number of people have limited
access to information because of poor literacy. The
most recent surveys of literacy in the United King-
dom reveal that 7 million adults in England can-
not locate the reference page for plumbers if given
the Yellow Pages alphabetical index. This means
that one in five adults has less literacy than the ex-
pected literacy in an 11-year-old child (Jama and
Dugdale, 2010; Williams et al, 2003a; Christina and
Jonathan, 2010). Additionally, almost 24 million
adults in the U.K. have insufficient numeracy skills
to perform simple everyday tasks such as paying
household bills and understanding wage slips. They
would be unable to achieve grade C in the GCSE
maths examination for 16-year-old school children
(Williams et al, 2003a).
?The Standard Rules on the Equalization of Op-
portunities for Persons with Disabilities? by United
Nations (1994) state that all public information ser-
vices and documents should be accessible in such
a way that they could be easily understood. If we
focus on numerical information, nowadays, a large
percentage of information expressed in daily news
or reports comes in the form of numerical expres-
sions (economic statistics, demography data, etc)
but many people have problems understanding the
more complex expressions. In the text simplification
process, different tasks are carried out: replacing
difficult words, splitting sentences, etc., and the sim-
plification of numerical expressions is one of them.
A possible approach to solve this important social
problem of making numerical information accessi-
ble is to rewrite difficult numerical expressions using
alternative wordings that are easier to understand.
For example, the original sentence, ?25.9% scored A
grades? could be rewritten by ?Around 26% scored
A grades?. In our study we define a ?numerical ex-
pression? as a phrase that presents a quantity, some-
times modified by a numerical hedge as in these ex-
amples: ?less than a quarter? or ?about 98%?. Such
an approach would require a set of rewriting strate-
gies yielding expressions that are linguistically cor-
rect, easier to understand than the original, and as
close as possible to the original meaning. Some loss
of precision could have positive advantages for nu-
merate people as well as less numerate. In rewrit-
ing, hedges play also an important role. For exam-
ple, ?50.9%? could be rewritten as ?about a half? us-
ing the hedge ?about?. In this kind of simplification,
hedges indicate that the original number has been
approximated and, in some cases, also the direction
of the approximation.
This paper presents a system developed for auto-
mated simplification of numerical expressions. Ex-
perts in simplification tasks are asked to validate the
39
simplifications done automatically. The system is
evaluated and the results are discussed against con-
clusions obtained from previous empirical survey.
2 Previous work
Text simplification, a relative new task in Natural
Language Processing, has been directed mainly at
syntactic constructions and lexical choices that some
readers find difficult, such as long sentences, pas-
sives, coordinate and subordinate clauses, abstract
words, low frequency words, and abbreviations.
The rule-based paradigm has been used in the
implementation of some systems for text simpli-
fication, each one focusing on a variety of read-
ers (with poor literacy, aphasia, etc) (Chandrasekar
et al, 1996; Siddharthan, 2003; Jr. et al, 2009;
Bautista et al, 2009).
The transformation of texts into easy-to-read ver-
sions can also be phrased as a translation problem
between two different subsets of language: the orig-
inal and the easy-to-read version. Corpus-based sys-
tems can learn from corpora the simplification oper-
ations and also the required degree of simplification
for a given task (Daelemans et al, 2004; Petersen
and Ostendorf, 2007; Gasperin et al, 2009).
A variety of simplification techniques have been
used, substituting common words for uncommon
words (Devlin and Tait, 1998), activating passive
sentences and resolving references (Canning, 2000),
reducing multiple-clause sentences to single-clause
sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Can-
ning, 2000; Siddharthan, 2002) and making appro-
priate choices at the discourse level (Williams et al,
2003b). Khan et at. (2008) studied the tradeoff be-
tween brevity and clarity in the context of generat-
ing referring expressions. Other researchers have fo-
cused on the generation of readable texts for readers
with low basic skills (Williams and Reiter, 2005),
and for teaching foreign languages (Petersen and
Ostendorf, 2007).
Previous work on numerical expressions has stud-
ied the treatment of numerical information in differ-
ent areas like health (Peters et al, 2007), forecast
(Dieckmann et al, 2009), representation of proba-
bilistic information (Bisantz et al, 2005) or vague
information (Mishra et al, 2011). In the NUM-
GEN project (Williams and Power, 2009), a corpus
of numerical expressions was collected and a for-
mal model for planning specifications for propor-
tions (numbers between 0 and 1) was developed.
The underlying theory and the design of the work-
ing program are described in (Power and Williams,
2012).
3 Experimental identification of
simplification strategies for numerical
information
In order to analyze different simplification strategies
for numerical expressions, first we have to study the
mathematical complexity of the expressions. Ex-
pressions can be classified and a level of difficulty
can be assigned. A study about the simplification
strategies selected by experts to simplify numerical
expressions expressed as decimal percentages in a
corpus was carried out in Bautista et al (2011b).
Other important aspect of the simplification task is
the use of hedges to simplify numerical expressions
in the text. A study was performed in Bautista et
al. (2011a) to analyze the use of hedges in the sim-
plification process. This study was done with ex-
perts in simplification tasks. A set of sentences with
numerical expressions were presented and they had
to rewrite the numerical expressions following some
rules. Several hypotheses were expressed and an-
alyzed to understand experts? preferences on sim-
plification strategies and use of hedges to simplify
numerical expressions in the text. The main conclu-
sions from the study were:
Conclusion 1: When experts choose expressions
for readers with low numeracy, they tend to prefer
round or common values to precise values. For ex-
ample, halves, thirds and quarters are usually pre-
ferred to eighths or similar, and expressions like N
in 10 or N in 100 are chosen instead of N in 36.
Conclusion 2: The value of the original propor-
tion influences the choice of simplification strategies
(fractions, ratios, percentages). With values in the
central range (say 0.2 to 0.8 in a 0.0 to 1.0 scale)
and values at the extreme ranges (say 0.0-0.2 and
0.8-1.0) favoring different strategies.
Conclusion 3: When writers choose numerical
expressions for readers with low numeracy, they
only use hedges if they are losing precision.

4 A system for adapting numerical
expressions
In this first prototype, only numerical expressions
defined as percentages are adapted. From an in-
put text, the percentage numerical expressions are
detected, a target level of difficulty is chosen and
the simplified version of the text is generated by re-
placing the original numerical expression with the
adapted expression.
4.1 Numerical expression
A numerical expression consists of: (1) a numerical
value, a quantity which may be expressed with dig-
its or with words; (2) an optional unit accompanying
the quantity (euro, miles, . . . ); and (3) an optional
numerical hedge modifier (around, less than, . . . ).
Some examples of numerical expressions used in
our experiments are: ?more than a quarter?, ?around
98.2%?, ?just over 25 per cent? or ?less than 100 kilo-
metres?.
4.2 Levels of difficulty
The Mathematics Curriculum of the Qualifications
and Curriculum Authority (1999) describes a num-
ber of teaching levels and we assume that concepts
to be taught at lower levels will be simpler than ones
taught at higher levels. Following this idea a Scale of
Mathematic Concepts is defined to identify the dif-
ferent levels of difficulty to understand mathematic
concepts. The scale defined from less to greater dif-
ficulty is: numerical expression in numbers (600),
words (six), fractions (1/4), ratios (1 in 4), percent-
ages (25%) and decimal percentages (33.8%).
From the Scale of Mathematic Concepts defined,
different levels of difficulty are considered in our
system. There are three different levels (from eas-
iest to hardest):
1. Fractions Level: each percentage in the text is
adapted using fractions as mathematical form
for the quantity, and sometimes a hedge is used.
2. Percentages without decimals Level (PWD):
the system rounds the original percentage with
decimals and uses hedges if they are needed.
3. Percentages with decimals Level: This is the
most difficult level where no adaptation is per-
formed.
The system operates only on numerical expres-
sions at the highest levels of the scale (the most dif-
ficult levels), that is, numerical expression given in
percentages or decimal percentages, adapting them
to other levels of less difficulty. So, the user can
select the level to which adapt the original numeri-
cal expression from the text. Using the interface of
the system, the level of difficulty is chosen by the fi-
nal user and the numerical expressions from the text
with higher level of difficulty than the level chosen
are adapted following the rules defined.
4.3 Set of strategies
A set of strategies is defined so they can be applied to
adapt the original numerical expression. The quan-
tity of the expression is replaced with another ex-
pression and sometimes numerical hedges are added
to create the simplified numerical expression.
The use of hedges to simplify numerical expres-
sion can be influenced by three parameters. The first
is the type of simplification depending on the math-
ematical knowledge of the final user. The second is
the simplification strategy for the choice of the final
mathematical form. And the last is the loss of preci-
sion that occurs when the expression is simplified.
Out of the European Guidelines for the Produc-
tion of Easy-to-Read Information for People with
Learning Disability (Freyhoff et al, 1998), only one
involves the treatment of numbers: ?Be careful with
numbers. If you use small numbers, always use the
number and not the word?. For example, if the texts
says ?four?, the system adapts it by ?4? following this
European Guideline. This strategy is applied by the
system at all levels.
There are other strategies to adapt numerical ex-
pressions in the form of percentage to other levels of
difficulty: (1) replace decimal percentages with per-
centages without decimals; (2) replace decimal per-
centages with ratios; (3) replace percentages with ra-
tios; (4) replace decimal percentages with fractions;
(5) replace percentages with fractions; (6) replace
ratios with fractions; (7) replace numerical expres-
sions in words with numerical expressions in digits.
At each level of difficulty, a subset of the strate-
gies is applied to simplify the numerical expression.
For the Fractions Level the strategies 4, 5 and 7
are used. For the Percentages with decimals Level
the strategies 1 and 7 are applied. And for the last
41
level, Percentages without decimals Level only the
last strategy, number 7, is used.
4.4 System operation
The system takes as input the original text. The user
of the system has to choose the level of difficulty. A
set of numerical expressions are selected and a set
of transformations is applied to adapt them, generat-
ing as output of the system a text with the numerical
expressions simplified at the chosen level.
The system works through several phases to adapt
the numerical expressions in the input text. Some of
them are internal working phases (2, 4 and 5). The
rest of them (1, 3 and 6) are phases where the user
of the system plays a role. The phases considered in
the system are:
1. Input text: an original text is selected to adapt
its numerical expressions.
2. Mark Numerical Expressions: the numerical
expressions that can be adapted are marked.
3. Choose the level of difficulty: the user chooses
the desired level of difficulty for the numerical
expressions in the text.
4. Adapt the numerical expression from the
text: each numerical expression is adapted if
the level of the numerical expression is higher
than the level of difficulty chosen.
5. Replace numerical expression in the text:
adapted numerical expressions replace the orig-
inals in the text.
6. Output text: the final adapted version of the
text is presented to the user.
The next subsections presents how the system acts
in each phase and what kind of tools are used to
achieve the final text.
4.4.1 Phase 1: Input text
In this first phase, a plain text is chosen as input to
the system to adapt its numerical expressions. Using
a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java, the user
can upload an original text.
4.4.2 Phase 2: Mark numerical expressions
For the text chosen, the system executes the Nu-
merical Expression Parser1. Using this parser the
numerical quantities are annotated with their type
(cardinal, fraction, percentage, decimal percentage,
etc.), their format (words, digits), their value (Vg),
their units, and hedging phrases, such as ?more
than?. The input to the program is the plain text file
and the output is the text with sentences and numer-
ical expressions annotated in XML format. In the
following code we can see how a numerical quantity
is annotated in the parser.
Overall figures showed the national pass
rate soared
<numex hedge=?above? hedge-
sem=?greaterthan? type=?percentage?
format=?digits? Vg=?0.97?>
above 97% </numex>
The XML file is treated by the system and numer-
ical expressions are marked in the original text. So,
the user can see which numerical expressions are go-
ing to be adapted by the system (in the next phase)
depending on the level of difficulty chosen.
4.4.3 Phase 3: Choose the level of difficulty
The user of the system chooses the level of dif-
ficulty to adapt the original numerical expressions.
There are three levels: fractions, percentages with-
out decimals and percentages with decimals.
4.4.4 Phase 4: Adapt the Numerical
Expressions
After deciding the level of difficulty, the system
has to adapt each numerical expression to generate
the final version. The process of simplification has
two stages: obtaining the candidate and applying the
adaptation and hedge choice rules.
From the XML file produced by the parser the fol-
lowing information for a numerical expression is ob-
tained: (1) if there is or not hedge and the kind of
hedge; (2) the type (cardinal, fraction, percentage,
decimal percentage) and format (digits or words)
of the original numerical expression; (3) the given
value (Vg) translated from the original numerical ex-
pression value of the text; and (4) the units from the

value is normalized (Vmg). A candidate substitute value (Vc) is chosen from the proportion approximation program
and normalized (Vr).
original expression (M, ins, grams). For example,
if in the text the original numerical expression is a
percentage like ?25.9%?, there is no hedge, the type
is ?decimal percentage?, the format is ?digits?, Vg is
0.259 and there are no units. In the expression, ?20
grams?, there is no hedge, the type is ?cardinal?, the
format is ?digits?, Vg is 20 and the parser annotates
the units with ?g?.
The given value Vg annotated by the parser is
transformed into a value between 0 to 1, referred
to as mapping given value (Vmg), which represents
the proportion under consideration. This value is
given as input to the proportion approximation pro-
gram (Power and Williams, 2012), which returns a
list of candidates for substitution. From this list,
the first option is taken as candidate substitute value
(Vc), because the program returns them in decreas-
ing order of precision. This means that the most
precise candidate at the required level of difficulty
is chosen. The program also might return the val-
ues ?none? and ?all? if the input value is close to
0 or 1, respectively. From the Vc we calculate the
rounded value (Vr) corresponding to the normaliza-
tion of the candidate value between 0 to 1. For ex-
ample, if Fraction level is chosen, for the original
expression ?more than 28%? with Vmg=0.28, the
system chooses Vc=1/3 with Vr=0.33. The whole
process can be seen in Figure 1.
An additional level of adaptation is required be-
yond simple replacement with the candidate substi-
tute value. If the original numerical expressions in
the text are difficult to understand, the system must
adapt them to the desired level of difficulty. For each
numerical expression, the system only applies the
adaptation rules if the difficulty level of the numer-
ical expression is higher than the level of difficulty
chosen by the user. This is captured by a set of three
adaptation rules:
? If the type of the numerical expression is ?car-
dinal? and the format is ?words? then the candi-
date to be used in the simplification is Vg. For
example, if the original numerical expression is
?six?, it will be replaced by ?6?.
? In a similar way, if the type is ?fraction? (the
lowest possible level of difficulty) and the for-
mat is also ?words? then the candidate is ob-
tained by applying the proportion approxima-
tion program. For example, if the original nu-
merical expression is ?a quarter?, it would be
replaced by ?1/4?.
? If the type is ?percentages? or ?decimal percent-
ages? and the format is ?digits? then the can-
didate is calculated by the proportion approxi-
mation program provided that the level of dif-
ficulty chosen in the GUI was lower than the
level of the calculated numerical expression.
In order to complete the simplification, the system
has to decide if a hedge should be used to achieve
the final version of the adapted numerical expres-
sion. This decision is taken based on the difference
in value between the value of the original expression
in the text (Vg) and the value of the candidate substi-
tute (Vc) (as given by the relative difference between
the normalized values Vr and Vmg calculated in the
first stage). The actual hedge used in the original
expression (if any) is also considered. The various
possible combinations of these values, and the corre-
sponding choice of final hedge, are described in Ta-
ble 1, which presents all possible options to decide
in each case, the hedge and the value corresponding
to the final numerical expression. For example, if
the original expression is ?more than 28%?, we have
Vc=1/3, Vmg=0.28 and Vr=0.33. Then Vr>Vmg so
the corresponding choice of the final hedge is in the
43
OriginalNumExp if Vr>Vmg if Vr=Vmg if Vr<Vmg
more than OrigValue around Vc more than Vc more than Vc
exactly OrigValue less than Vc exactly Vc more than Vc
less than OrigValue less than Vc less than Vc around Vc
OrigValue around Vc Vc around Vc
Table 1: Hedge Choice Rules. For each original expression (OrigValue), the normalized values (Vmg, Vr) are used to
determinate the hedge chosen for the simplified expression. The final version is composed by the hedge chosen and
the candidate value (Vc)
first column of Table 1 (?around?) and the simplified
expression is ?around 1/3?.
When the user chooses the Fraction Level in the
system, every numerical expression with difficulty
level greater than fraction level will be replaced by
a numerical expression expressed in fraction form.
Depending on the values Vr and Vmg, the appropri-
ate hedge will be chosen.
4.4.5 Phase 5: Replace numerical expressions
Once the system has applied its rules, an adapted
version is available for each original numerical ex-
pression which was more difficult than the target dif-
ficulty level. The output text is obtained by replac-
ing these difficult expressions with the correspond-
ing simplified version.
5 Evaluation of the system
This section presents the evaluation of the system,
describing the materials, experiment, participants
and results of the evaluation.
5.1 Materials
We selected for the experiment a set of eight can-
didate sentences from the NUMGEN corpus, but the
number of numerical expressions was larger as some
sentences contained more than one proportion ex-
pression. In total we had 13 numerical expressions.
We selected sentences with as many variations in
context, precision and different wordings as possi-
ble. The range of proportions values was from points
nearly 0.0 to almost 1.0, to give coverage to a wide
spread of proportion values. We considered values
in the central range (say 0.2 to 0.8) and values at the
extreme ranges (say 0.0-0.2 and 0.8-1.0). We also
classified as common values the well-known per-
centages and fractions like 25%, 50%, 1/4 and 1/2,
and as uncommon values the rest like 15% or 6/7.
5.2 Experiment
To evaluate the system a questionnaire was pre-
sented to a set of human evaluators. The experi-
ment was created and presented on SurveyMonkey2,
a commonly-used provider of web surveys. For each
original sentence, we presented two possible simpli-
fications generated by the system. Participants were
asked to use their judgement to decide whether they
agreed that the simplified sentences were acceptable
for the original sentence. A Likert scale of four val-
ues (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly
Agree) was used to collect the answers.
In the survey only two levels of adaptation from
the original sentence were presented. The first op-
tion generated by the system was for the Fractions
level. The second option generated by the system
was for the Percentages without decimals (PWD).
5.3 Participants
The task of simplifying numerical expressions is dif-
ficult, so we selected a group of 34 experts made up
of primary or secondary school mathematics teach-
ers or adult basic numeracy tutors, all native English
speakers. This group is well qualified to tackle the
task since they are highly numerate and accustomed
to talking to people who do not understand mathe-
matical concepts very well. We found participants
through personal contacts and posts to Internet fo-
rums for mathematics teachers and numeracy tutors.
5.4 Results
The answers from the participants were evaluated.
In total we collected 377 responses, 191 responses
for the Fraction level and 186 responses for the Per-
centage without decimals (PWD). Table 2 shows the
average from the collected responses, considering 1

Table 3: Opinion of the experts in percentages
to 4 for strongly disagree to strongly agree. In ad-
dition, Table 3 shows the distribution in percentages
of the opinion of the experts. At the Fraction level,
there is not too much difference between the average
of the answers of the experts that agree with the sys-
tem and those that disagree. Most experts are neu-
tral. But for the PWD level the average shows that
most experts agree with the simplification done.
We have also analyzed the answers considering
two different criteria from the original numerical ex-
pressions: when they are central (20% to 80%) or
extreme values (0% to 20% and 80% to 100%), and
when the original numerical expressions are com-
mon or uncommon values. In general terms, the ex-
perts think that the simplification done by the sys-
tem in the PWD level is better than the simplification
done in the Fraction level. They disagree specially
with the simplification using fractions in two cases.
One is the treatment of the extreme values where the
system obtains as possible candidates ?none? and
?all?3. Another case is when uncommon fractions
are used to simplify the numerical expression, like
for example 9/10. In these two cases the average is
lower than the rest of the average achieved.
5.5 Discussion
The system combines syntactic transformations (via
the introduction of hedges) and lexical substitu-
3See (Power and Williams, 2012) for a discussion of appro-
priate hedges for values near the extreme points of 0 and 1.
tions (by replacing actual values with substitution
candidates and transforming quantities expressed as
words into digits) to simplify the original numerical
expression. These kinds of transformations are dif-
ferent from those used by other systems, which rely
only on syntactic transformations or only on lexi-
cal substitutions. Rules are purpose-specific and fo-
cused on numerical expressions. With this kind of
transformations the readability of the text improves
in spite of the fact that the resulting syntactic struc-
ture of the numerical expression is more compli-
cated, due to the possible presence of hedges. For
example, for a original numerical expression like
?25.9%? the system generates the simplified ?more
than a quarter? which is easier to understand even
though longer and syntactically more complex.
With respect to coverage of different types of nu-
merical expressions, this system does not consider
ratios as a possible simplification strategy because
the proportion approximation program does not use
them as candidates to simplify a proportion. This
possibility should be explored in the future.
Another observation is that the system does not
consider the context of the sentence in which the
numerical expression occurs. For example, if the
sentence makes a comparison between two numer-
ical expressions that the system rounded to the same
value, the original meaning is lost. One example
of this case is the following sentence from the cor-
pus: ?One in four children were awarded A grades
(25.9%, up from 25.3% last year)?. Both percent-
ages ?25.9%? and ?25.3%? are simplified by the sys-
tem using ?around 1/4? and the meaning of the sen-
tence is lost. Thus we should consider the role of
context (the set of numerical expressions in a given
sentence as a whole and the meaning of the text) in
establishing what simplifications must be used.

6 Conforming with conclusions of prior
surveys
The results presented for the system are evaluated
in this section for conformance with the conclusions
resulting from the empirical studies described in
(Bautista et al, 2011b) and (Bautista et al, 2011a).
With respect to the preference for round or com-
mon values in simplification (Conclusion 1), the sys-
tem presented conforms to this preference by virtue
of the way in which the list of candidate substitu-
tions is produced by the program. The candidates re-
turned by the program are already restricted to com-
mon values of percentages (rounded up) and frac-
tions, so the decision to consider as preferred candi-
date the one listed first implicitly applies the criteria
that leads to this behavior.
With respect to the need to treat differently values
in the extreme or central ranges of proportion (Con-
clusion 2), the system addresses this need by virtue
of the actual set of candidates produced by the pro-
gram in each case. For example, if the original ex-
pression is a extreme value like ?0.972?, the program
produces a different candidate substitution (?almost
all?) that in the central ranges is not considered.
With respect to restricting the use of hedges to
situations where loss of precision is incurred (Con-
clusion 3), the hedge choice rules applied by the
system (see Table 1) satisfy this restriction. When
Vr=Vmg hedges are included in the simplified ex-
pression only if they were already present in the
original expression.
In addition, the system rounds up any quantities
with decimal positions to the nearest whole num-
ber whenever the decimal positions are lost during
simplification. This functionality is provided im-
plicitly by the program, which presents the rounded
up version as the next option immediately follow-
ing the alternative which includes the decimal posi-
tions. For example, if the input proportion is ?0.198?,
some rounded candidate substitutions are calculated
as ?almost 20%? or ?less than 20%?.
Finally, the system follows the European guide-
lines for the production of easy to read information
in that it automatically replaces numerical quantities
expressed in words with the corresponding quantity
expressed in digits.
7 Conclusions and future work
The system described in this paper constitutes a first
approximation to the task of simplifying numerical
expressions in a text to varying degrees of difficulty.
The definition of an scale of difficulty of numeri-
cal expressions, the identification of rules governing
the selection of candidate substitution and the appli-
cation of hedges constitute important contributions.
The empirical evaluation of the system with human
experts results in acceptable rates of agreement. The
behavior of the system conforms to the conclusions
on simplification strategies as applied by humans re-
sulting from previous empirical surveys.
There are different aspects to improve the actual
system from the data collected, with a special atten-
tion to cases in which the experts disagree. As future
work, the syntactic context should be considered to
simplify numerical expression, extending the kind
of proportion to simplify and treating special cases
analyzed in this first version. At the syntactic level,
some transformation rules can be implemented from
a syntactic analysis. It is important that the meaning
of the sentences be preserved regardless of whether
part of the sentence is deleted or rewritten by the
adaptation rules. In addition, the numerical expres-
sion parser and the proportion approximation pro-
gram could also be studied in order to evaluate the
impact of their errors in the final performance.
Our final aim is to develop an automatic simplifi-
cation system in a broader sense, possibly including
more complex operations like syntactic transforma-
tions of the structure of the input text, or lexical sub-
stitution to reduce the complexity of the vocabulary
employed in the text. Additionally we hope to de-
velop versions of the simplification system for other
languages, starting with Spanish. Probably the sim-
plification strategies for numbers would be the same
but the use of hedge modifiers may be different.
