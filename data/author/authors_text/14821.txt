Abstract 
This paper describes a novel approach pre-
sented to the BioNLP?11 Shared Task on 
GENIA event extraction. The approach con-
sists of three steps. First, a dictionary is auto-
matically constructed based on training 
datasets which is then used to detect candidate 
triggers and determine their event types. Sec-
ond, we apply a set of heuristic algorithms 
which use syntactic patterns and candidate 
triggers detected in the first step to extract 
biological events. Finally, a post-processing is 
used to resolve regulatory events. We 
achieved an F-score of 43.94% using the 
online evaluation system. 
1 Introduction 
The explosive growth of biomedical scientific 
literature has attracted a significant interest on de-
veloping methods to automatically extract biologi-
cal relations in texts. Until recently, most research 
was focused on extracting binary relations such as 
protein-protein interactions (PPIs), gene-disease, 
and drug-mutation relations. However, the ex-
tracted binary relations cannot fully represent the 
original biomedical data. Therefore, there is an 
increasing need to extract fine-grained and com-
plex relations such as biological events (Miwa et 
al., 2010). The BioNLP?09 Shared Task (Kim et 
al., 2009) was the first shared task that provided a 
consistent data set and evaluation tools for extrac-
tion of such biological relations.  
Several approaches to extract biological events 
have been proposed for this shared task. Based on 
their characteristics, these approaches can be di-
vided into 3 groups. The first group uses a rule-
based approach which implements a set of manu-
ally defined rules developed by experts or auto-
matically learned from training data. These rules 
are then applied on dependency parse trees to ex-
tract biological events (Kaljurand et al, 2009; Kil-
icoglu and Bergler, 2009). The second group uses a 
machine learning (ML)-based approach which ex-
ploits various specific features and learning algo-
rithms to extract events (Bj?rne at al., 2009; Miwa 
et al, 2010). The third group uses hybrid methods 
that combine both rule- and ML-based approaches 
to solve the problem (Ahmed et al, 2009; M?ra et 
al., 2009). Among these proposed approaches, the 
ML achieved the best results, however, it is non-
trivial to apply. 
In this paper, we propose a rule-based approach 
which uses two syntactic patterns derived from a 
parse tree. The proposed approach consists of the 
following components: a dictionary to detect trig-
gers, text pre-processing, and event extraction.  
2 System and method 
2.1 Dictionary for event trigger detection 
The construction of the dictionary consists of the 
following steps: grouping annotated triggers, filter-
ing out irrelevant triggers, and calculating suppor-
tive scores. First, we collect all annotated triggers 
in the training and development datasets, convert 
them to lowercase format and group them based on 
their texture values and event types. For each trig-
ger in a group, we count its frequency being anno-
tated as trigger and its frequency being found in 
the training datasets to compute a confident score.  
Next, we create a list of non-trigger words from 
the training dataset which consists of a list of prep-
ositions (e.g. to, by), and a list of adjectives (e.g. 
high, low). We then filter out triggers that belong 
to the non-trigger list as well as triggers that con-
sist of more than two words as suggested in the 
previous studies (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009). We 
further filter out more triggers by setting a fre-
quency threshold for each event type. Triggers that 
143
have a frequency lower than a given threshold 
(which is empirically determined for each event 
type) are excluded.  
In addition, for each binding trigger (i.e. trigger 
of binding event) we compute a t2score which is 
the ratio of having a second argument.  For each 
regulatory trigger we compute an escore which is 
the ratio of having an event as the first argument 
(theme) and a cscore is the ratio of having a second 
argument (cause).  
2.2 Text preprocessing 
Text preprocessing includes splitting sentences, 
replacing protein names with place-holders, and 
parsing sentences using the Stanford Lexical Par-
ser1. First, we split the input text (e.g. title, ab-
stract, paragraph) into single sentences using 
LingPipe sentence splitter2. Sentences that do not 
contain protein names are dropped.  Second, we 
replace protein names with their given annotated 
IDs in order to prevent the parser from segmenting 
multiple word protein names. Finally, the sen-
tences are parsed with the Stanford parser to pro-
duce syntactic parse trees. All parse trees are 
stored in a local database for later use. 
Detection of event trigger and event type: For 
each input sentence, we split the sentence into to-
kens and use the dictionary to detect a candidate 
trigger and determine its event type (hereafter we 
referred to as ?trigger? type). After this step, we 
obtain a list of candidate triggers and their related 
scores for each event type.  
2.3 Event extraction 
To extract the biological events from a parse 
tree after obtaining a list of candidate triggers, we 
adapt two syntactic patterns based on our previous 
work on extracting PPIs (Bui et al, 2011). These 
patterns are applied for triggers in noun, verb, and 
adjective form. In the following sections we de-
scribe the rules to extract events in more detail. 
 
Rule 1: Extracting events from a noun phrase (NP) 
If the candidate trigger is a noun, we find a NP 
which is a joined node of this trigger and at least 
one protein from the parse tree. There are two NP 
patterns that can satisfy the given condition which 
are shown in Figure 1. In the first case (form1), NP

2 http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/ 
does not contain a PP tag, and in the second case 
(form2), the trigger is the head of this NP. Depend-
ing on the trigger type (simple, binding or regula-
tory event), candidate events are extracted by the 
following rules as shown in Table 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Event

Conditions and Actions 
Simple  
or 
Regula-
tory 
NP in form1: extract all proteins on the 
left of the trigger from NP. Form event 
pairs <trigger, protein>. 
NP in form2: extract all proteins on the 
right of the trigger from NP. Form event 
pairs <trigger, protein>. 
Binding 
  
NP in form1: If proteins are in compound 
form i.e. PRO1/PRO2, PRO1-PRO2 then 
form an event triple <trigger, protein1, 
protein2>. Otherwise, form events pairs 
<trigger, protein>. 
NP in form2: If NP contains one of the 
following preposition pairs: between/and, 
of/with, of/to, and the trigger? t2score >0.2 
then split the proteins from NP into two 
lists: list1 and list2 based on the second 
PP (preposition phrase) or CC (conjunc-
tion). Form triples <trigger, protein1, pro-
tein2>, in which protein1 from list1 and 
protein2 from list2. Otherwise, form 
events the same way as simple event case. 
 
Table 1: Conditions and actions to extract events from a 
NP. Simple and regulatory events use the same rules. 
 
Rule 2: Extracting events from a verb phrase (VP) 
If the candidate trigger is a verb, we find a VP 
which is a direct parent of this trigger from the 
parse tree and find a sister NP immediately preced-
ing this VP. Next, candidate events are extracted 
by the following rules as shown in Table 2.

The event trigger is an adjective: For a candidate 
trigger which is an adjective, if the trigger is in a 
compound form (e.g. PRO1-mediated), we apply 
rule1 to extract events. In this case, the compound 
protein (e.g. PRO1) is used as cause argument. 
Otherwise, we apply rule 2 to extract.   
2.4 Post-processing 
Post-processing includes determination of an 
event type for a shared trigger and checking cross-
references of regulatory events. For each extracted 
event which has a shared trigger3, this event is ver-
ified using a list of modified words (e.g. gene, 
mRNA) to determine final event type. For regula-
tory events, the post-processing is used to find 
cross reference events. The post-processing is 
shown in Algorithm 1.

VP 
2.5 Algorithm to extract events 
The whole process of extracting biological event is 
shown in Algorithm 1

group, see section 2.1.

3 Results and discussion 
Table 3 shows the latest results of our system 
obtained from the online evaluation system (the 
official evaluation results are 38.19%). The results 
show that our method performs well on simple and 
binding events with an F-score of 63.03%. It out-
performs previously proposed rule-based systems 
on these event types despite the fact that part of the 
test set consists of full text sentences. In addition, 
our system adapts two syntactic patterns which 
were previously developed for PPIs extraction. 
This means that the application of syntactic infor-
mation is still relevant to extract biological events. 
In other words, there are some properties these ex-
traction tasks share. However, the performance 
Event type Conditions and Actions  
Simple If VP contains at least one protein then 
extract all proteins which have a posi-
tion on the right of the trigger from the 
VP to create a protein list. Otherwise, 
extract all proteins that belong to the 
NP. Form event pairs <trigger, protein> 
with the obtained protein list. 
Binding If VP contains at least one protein then 
extract all proteins which have a posi-
tion on the right of the trigger from VP 
to create a protein list1. Extracting all 
proteins that belong to the NP to create 
protein list2. If both list1 and list2 are 
not empty then form triples <trigger, 
protein1, protein2>, in which protein1 
from list1 and protein2 from list2. Oth-
erwise, form event pairs <trigger, pro-
tein> from the non-empty protein list. 
Regulatory If trigger? cscore>0.3 then extract the 
same way as for the binding event, in 
which protein from list1 is used for 
cause argument. Otherwise follows the 
rule of the simple event.

significantly decreases on regulatory events with 
an F-score of 26.61%.  
Analyzing the performance of our system on 
regulatory events reveals that in most of false posi-
tive cases, the errors are caused by not resolving 
reference events properly. These errors can be re-
duced if we have a better implementation of the 
post-processing phase. Another source of errors is 
that the proposed method did not take into account 
the dependency among events. For example, most 
transcription events occurred when the regulatory 
events occurred (more than 50% cases). If associa-
tion rules are applied here then the precision of 
both event types will increase.  
 
 
To improve the overall performance of the sys-
tem, there are many issues one should take into 
account. The first issue is related to the distance or 
the path length from the joined node between an 
event trigger and its arguments. By setting a 
threshold for the distance for each event type we 
increase the precision of the system. The second 
issue is related to setting thresholds for the extrac-
tion rules (e.g. t2score, cscore) which is done by 
using empirical data. Many interesting challenges 
remain to be solved, among which are the co-
reference, anaphora resolution, and cross sentence 
events. Furthermore, the trade-off between recall 
and precision needs to be taken into account, set-
ting high thresholds for a dictionary might increase 
the precision, but could however drop the recall 
significantly.   
4 Conclusion 
In this paper we have proposed a novel system 
which uses syntactic patterns to extract biological 
events from a text. Our method achieves promising 
results on simple and binding events. The results 
also indicate that syntactic patterns for extracting 
PPIs and biological events share some common 
properties. Therefore systems developed for ex-
tracting PPIs can potentially be used to extract bio-
logical events.

Abstract 
In this paper we present a biomedical event 
extraction system for the BioNLP 2013 event 
extraction task. Our system consists of two 
phases. In the learning phase, a dictionary and 
patterns are generated automatically from 
annotated events. In the extraction phase, the 
dictionary and obtained patterns are applied to 
extract events from input text. When evaluated 
on the GENIA event extraction task of the 
BioNLP 2013 shared task, the system obtained 
the best results on strict matching and the third 
best on approximate span and recursive 
matching, with F-scores of 48.92 and 50.68, 
respectively. Moreover, it has excellent 
performance in terms of speed. 
1 Introduction 
A growing amount of biomedical data is 
continuously being produced, resulting largely 
from the widespread application of high-
throughput techniques, such as gene and protein 
analysis. This growth is accompanied by a 
corresponding increase of textual information, in 
the form of articles, books and technical reports. 
In order to organize and manage these data, 
several manual curation efforts have been set up 
to identify entities (e.g., genes and proteins), 
their interactions (e.g., protein-protein) and 
events (e.g., transcription and gene regulation). 
The extracted information is then stored in 
structured knowledge resources, such as 
MEDLINE and Swiss-Prot. However, manual 
curation of large quantities of data is a very 
demanding and expensive task, and it is difficult 
to keep these databases up-to-date. These factors 
have naturally led to an increasing interest in the 
application of text mining (TM) systems to 
support those tasks.  
Automatic recognition of biomedical events 
from scientific documents was highly promoted 
by the BioNLP challenges (Kim et al, 2009; 
2011), focusing on events that involve genes and 
proteins, such as gene expression, binding, and 
regulation. Such events are typically represented 
as the relation between a trigger and one or more 
arguments, which can be biomedical concepts or 
other events.  
Several approaches have been proposed to 
extract biological events from text (Kim et al, 
2009; 2011). Based on their characteristics and 
applied natural language processing (NLP) tools, 
these approaches can be categorized into two 
main groups, namely rule- and machine learning 
(ML)-based approaches. Rule-based approaches 
consist of a set of rules that are manually defined 
or automatically learned from training data (Bui 
& Sloot, 2011; Cohen et al. 2009; Kaljurand et 
al., 2009; Kilicoglu & Bergler, 2011). To extract 
events from text, first event triggers are detected 
using a dictionary, then the defined rules are 
applied to the output of the NLP tools e.g., 
dependency parse trees, to find their arguments. 
On the other hand, ML-based approaches exploit 
various feature sets and learning algorithms to 
extract events (Bj?rne & Salakoski, 2011; Miwa 
et al, 2010; 2012; Riedel & McCallum, 2011).  
This article presents an enhanced version of 
our biomedical event extraction system (Bui & 
Sloot, 2012). Here we simplify the way patterns 
are generated from training data and improve the 
method to extract events from text based on the 
obtained patterns. 
104
2 System and methods 
The workflow of the system is illustrated in 
Figure 1. A text preprocessing step, which 
converts unstructured text into a structured 
representation, is applied for both learning and 
extraction phases. In the learning phase, a 
dictionary and patterns are generated 
automatically from annotated events. In the 
extraction phase, the dictionary and obtained 
patterns are applied to extract events from input 
text.  
 
2.1 Text preprocessing 
The text preprocessing step intends to break the 
input text into meaningful units, in order to 
reveal important linguistic features. This step 
consists of splitting input text into single 
sentences, tokenizing sentences, part-of-speech 
(POS) tagging, shallow parsing, and converting 
obtained chunks into simple clauses. An in-depth 
description of this step is provided in (Bui & 
Sloot, 2012). An example of a structured 
representation is illustrated in Figure 2. 
 
2.2 Building a dictionary 
The dictionary construction is carried out 
automatically using event triggers from training 
data. This process consists of four steps: 
grouping event triggers, calculating confidence 
scores, filtering out irrelevant triggers, and 
determining event types. First, we collect all 
event triggers annotated in the training dataset, 
convert them to lower-case and group them 
based on their text and event types. For each 
event trigger, we count the number of times it 
appears as an event trigger and the number of 
times it appears in the training dataset, in order to 
calculate its confidence score. Next, we filter out 
triggers that have POS tags not starting with 
?NN?, ?VB?, or ?JJ?, as well as triggers that 
consist of more than two words, as suggested in a 
previous study (Kilicoglu & Bergler, 2011). We 
further filter out more triggers by setting a 
frequency threshold and confidence score for 
each event type. Finally, we assign an event type 
for each event trigger based on its type annotated 
in the training data. If an event trigger belongs to 
more than one event group, we determine its 
event type based on the event group where it 
appears with highest frequency. For instance, the 
?effect? trigger appears in both ?Regulation? and 
?Positive_regulation? groups, but its frequency 
in the ?Regulation? group is higher, therefore it 
is assumed to be a ?Regulation? event trigger. 
 
2.3 Predefined patterns 
When using a structured representation to 
express biomedical events, in most cases, an 
event can be mapped into a ?container?, i.e., a 
chunk, a phrase, or a clause as shown in Figure 
2. Based on this representation, we define a list 
of the most common patterns that encode 
relations between an event trigger and its 
arguments. The predefined list of patterns is 
shown in Table 1. We skip all events that cannot 
be expressed within a simple clause.

event trigger and its arguments. Trg denotes event

arg2: theme2 or cause of an event. 
2.4 Generating patterns 
To generate a pattern for each event, first we find 
a suitable container (e.g., chunk, phrase, or 
clause) that contains the event trigger and its 
arguments. If such a container is found, a pattern 
is generated by extracting features from that 
container using a list of defined feature set as 
shown in Table 2. Each generated pattern is then 
assigned a key by combining its event trigger, 
POS tag, pattern type, and container type. This 
key is used to retrieve this pattern in the 
extraction step. During the learning process, if a 
key of a newly generated pattern already exists, 
the system increases the frequency attribute of 
the existing pattern and updates the other 
attributes accordingly. 
 
Features Description and examples 
Trigger Event trigger. 
Prep1 Preposition between theme and trigger, e.g. of, 
in. 
Pattern type Defined in Table 1. 
Prep2 Preposition between cause/theme2 and trigger.  
Container The container which contains this event. 
Distance1 Distance (number of chunks) between theme and 
event trigger. 
Distance2 Distance (number of chunks) between 
cause/theme2 and event trigger. 
POS POS tag of the trigger e.g. NN, ADJ, and VBZ. 
Pro1 count Count number of events with a protein as theme. 
Even1 count Count number of events with an event as theme. 
Pro2 count Count number of events with a protein as 
theme2/cause. 
Even2 count Count number of events with an event as 
theme2/cause. 
Frequency Number of events sharing the same pattern key. 
This value is used to rank the patterns in the 
extraction step. 
 
Table 2: Feature set used to generate patterns. 
2.5 Extracting events 
In this step, we apply the obtained patterns to 
extract events from text. First, the input sentence 
is converted into a structured representation by 
applying the text preprocessing step. Next, 
tokens of each sentence are matched against the 
dictionary to detect candidate event triggers. For 
each candidate event trigger, a key is generated 
to retrieve its corresponding patterns. If patterns 
for the event trigger exist, we then apply the 
retrieved patterns using the order of the syntactic 
layers: chunk, phrase, and clause (see Figure 2). 
Furthermore, if there is more than one pattern 
available for a syntactic layer (e.g. chunk, 
phrase), the order to apply patterns is determined 
by the frequency of these patterns, which is 
calculated in the previous step. Patterns with 
higher frequency have higher priority.

score of all entries in the dictionary was set to 
0.1. In the extraction phase, the distance features 
(?Distance1? and ?Distance2?) were set to a 
maximum of 10 chunks, and patterns that have a 
frequency lower than 3 were not used in order to 
reduce false-positive events.

data show that our system performs well on 
simple events (?simple all?) with an average F-
score of 76.11, followed by protein modification 
events (?prot-mod all?) with an average F-score 
of 74.37. The performance declines on binding 
events with an F-score of 49.76 and regulatory 
events (?regulation all?) with an average F-score 
of 35.80. When comparing the performance of 
our system between the two matching criteria, 
the data indicate that only Transcription events 
gain significant performance, with an F-score 
increase of 30 points.

best results on strict matching, and ranks third on 
approximate matching, with a slight difference in 
F-score of 0.29 point compared to the best 
system. Furthermore, our system yields the best 
precision on both matching criteria, with a 
considerable difference on strict matching.

A closer look at the official results (data not 
shown) reveals that our system obtains the best 
performance on Binding event with an F-score of 
49.76, which is significantly higher than the 
second-best system (F-score 43.32). 
Interestingly, our system also yields the highest 
F-score (58.77) when evaluated on themes only. 
When aiming for a large-scale relation 
extraction, system performance in terms of speed 
has to be taken into account. By employing a 
simple text processing and an effective event 
extraction algorithm, our system is very fast. On 
a standard PC with 4GB of RAM, it takes 49s to 
process the training dataset and 11s to process 
the test dataset.  
4 Conclusion and future work 
This article presents a system for biomedical 
event extraction that generates patterns 
automatically from training data. When 
evaluated on the test set, it presented the best 
results with strict matching and the third best 
with approximate span and recursive matching. 
Moreover, it obtains high precision on both 
evaluation criteria, and has an excellent 
performance in terms of speed.  
There are various ways to further improve the 
performance of the system. First, we believe that 
an ML-based approach for trigger recognition 
will improve its results, by minimizing 
ambiguity problems and improving recall, 
especially on regulatory events. Second, the final 
performance depends on the output of the text-
preprocessing step, especially the conversion of 
chunks into structured representations. If the 
performance of this step is improved, for 
example by using predicate argument structures 
as proposed by (Miwa et al, 2010) to obtain 
relations between subject-verb-object, then more 
precise patterns could be obtained in the learning 
phase. Consequently, the extraction phase would 
have a cleaner input (with less false positives and 
false negatives), which will eventually enhance 
the performance. Furthermore, as proposed in 
our previous study (Bui et al, 2011), the output 
of the current system can be used as the input for 
an ML classifier to further reduce false-positive 
events. The feature set used in the predefined 
patterns can also be used directly as feature set 
for the ML classifier.
