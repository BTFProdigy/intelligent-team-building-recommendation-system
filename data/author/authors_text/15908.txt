Abstract
This paper presents Folheador, an online
service for browsing through Portuguese
semantic relations, acquired from differ-
ent sources. Besides facilitating the ex-
ploration of Portuguese lexical knowledge
bases, Folheador is connected to services
that access Portuguese corpora, which pro-
vide authentic examples of the semantic re-
lations in context.
1 Introduction
Lexical knowledge bases (LKBs) hold informa-
tion about the words of a language and their in-
teractions, according to their possible meanings.
They are typically structured on word senses,
which may be connected by means of semantic re-
lations. Besides important resources for language
studies, LKBs are key resources in the achieve-
ment of natural language processing tasks, such
as word sense disambiguation (see e.g. Agirre et
al. (2009)) or question answering (see e.g. Pasca
and Harabagiu (2001)).
Regarding the complexity of most knowledge
bases, their data formats are generally not suited
for being read by humans. User interfaces have
thus been developed for providing easier ways of
exploring the knowledge base and assessing its
contents. For instance, for LKBs, in addition to
information on words and semantic relations, it is
important that these interfaces provide usage ex-
amples where semantic relations hold, or at least
where related words co-occur.
In this paper, we present Folheador1, an on-
line browser for Portuguese LKBs. Besides an
1See http://www.linguateca.pt/Folheador/
interface for navigating through semantic rela-
tions acquired from different sources, Folheador
is linked to two services that provide access to
Portuguese corpora, thus allowing observation of
related words co-occurring in authentic contexts
of use, some of them even evaluated by humans.
After introducing several well-known LKBs
and their interfaces, we present Folheador and
its main features, also detailing the contents of
the knowledge base currently browseable through
this interface, which contains information ac-
quired from public domain lexical resources of
Portuguese. Then, before concluding, we discuss
additional features planned for the future.
2 Related Work
Here, we mention a few interfaces that ease the
exploration of well-known knowledge bases. Re-
garding the knowledge base structure, some of the
interfaces are significantly different.
Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is the
most widely used LKB to date. In addition to
other alternatives, the creators of WordNet pro-
vide online access to their resource through the
WordNet Search interface (Princeton University,
2010)2. As WordNet is structured around synsets
(groups of synonymous lexical items), querying
for a word prompts all synsets containing that
word to be presented. For each synset, its part-
of-speech (PoS), a gloss and a usage example are
provided. Synsets can also be expanded to access
the semantic relations they are involved in.
As a resource also organised in synsets, the

webwn
35
Brazilian Portuguese thesaurus TeP3 has a sim-
ilar interface (Maziero et al 2008). Neverthe-
less, since TeP does not contain relations besides
antonymy, its interface is simpler and provides
only the synsets containing a queried word and
their part-of-speech.
MindNet (Vanderwende et al 2005) is a LKB
extracted automatically, mainly from dictionar-
ies, and structured on semantic relations connect-
ing word senses to words. Its authors provide
MNEX4, an online interface for MindNet. After
querying for a pair of words, MNEX provides all
the semantic relation paths between them, estab-
lished by a set of links that connect directly or
indirectly one word to another. It is also possible
to view the definitions that originated the path.
FrameNet (Baker et al 1998) is a man-
ually built knowledge base structured on se-
mantic frames that describe objects, states or
events. There are several means for explor-
ing FrameNet easily, including FrameSQL (Sato,
2003)5, which allows searching for frames, lexi-
cal units and relations in an integrated interface,
and FrameGrapher6, a graphical interface for the
visualization of frame relations. For each frame,
in both interfaces, a textual definition, annotated
sentences of the frame elements, lists of the frame
relations, and lists with the lexical units in the
frame are provided.
ReVerb (Fader et al 2011) is a Web-scale
information extraction system that automatically
acquires binary relations from text. Using ReVerb
Search7, a web interface for ReVerb extractions, it
is possible to obtain sets of relational triples where
the predicate and/or the arguments contain given
strings. Regarding that each of the former is op-
tional, it is possible, for instance, to search for all
triples with the predicate loves and first argument
Portuguese. Search results include the matching
triples, organised according to the name of the
predicate, as well as the number of times each
triple was extracted. The sentences where each
triple was extracted from are as well provided.

Finally, Visual Thesaurus (Huiping et al
2006)8 is a proprietary graphical interface that
provides an alternative way of exploring a knowl-
edge base structured on word senses, synonymy,
antonymy and hypernymy relations. It presents a
graph centered on a queried word, connected to its
senses, as well as semantic relations between the
senses and other words. Nodes and edges have a
different color or look, respectively according to
the PoS of the sense or to the type of semantic re-
lation. If a word is clicked, a new graph, centered
on that word, is drawn.
3 Folheador
Folheador, in figure 2, is an online service for
browsing through instances of semantic relations,
represented as relational triples.
Folheador was originally designed as an inter-
face for PAPEL (Gonc?alo Oliveira et al 2010),
a public domain lexical-semantic network, auto-
matically extracted from a proprietary dictionary.
It was soon expanded to other (public) resources
for Portuguese as well (see Santos et al(2010) for
an overview of Portuguese LKBs).
The current version of Folheador browses
through a LKB that, besides PAPEL, in-
tegrates semantic triples from the following
sources: (i) synonymy acquired from two hand-
crafted thesauri of Portuguese9, TeP (Dias-Da-
Silva and de Moraes, 2003; da Silva et al
2002) and OpenThesaurus.PT10; (ii) relations ex-
tracted automatically in the scope of the project
Onto.PT (Gonc?alo Oliveira and Gomes, 2010;
Gonc?alo Oliveira et al 2011), which include
triples extracted from Wiktionary.PT11, and from
Diciona?rio Aberto (Simo?es and Farinha, 2011),
both public domain dictionaries.
Underlying relation triples in Folheador are
thus in the form x RELATED-TO y, where x and
y are lexical items and RELATED-TO is a predi-
cate. Their interpretation is as follows: one sense
of x is related to one sense of y, by means of a re-
lation whose type is identified by RELATED-TO.
8http://www.visualthesaurus.com/
9We converted the thesauri to triples x synonym-of y,
where x and y are lexical items in the same synset.

3.1 Navigation
It is possible to use Folheador for searching for
all relations with one, two, or no fixed arguments,
and one or no types (relation names). Combining
these options, Folheador can be used, for instance,
to obtain: all lexical items related to a particular
item; all relations between two lexical items; or a
sample of relations involving a particular type.
The matching triples are listed and may be
filtered according to the resource they were ex-
tracted from. For each triple, the PoS of the ar-
guments is shown, as well as a list with the iden-
tification of the resources from where it was ac-
quired. The arguments of each triple are also links
that make navigation easier. When clicked, Fol-
heador behaves the same way as if it had been
queried with the clicked word as argument. Also,
since the queried lexical item may occur in the
first or in the second argument of a triple, when
it occurs in the second, Folheador inverts the rela-
tion, so that the item appears always as the first ar-
gument. Therefore, there is no need to store both
the direct and the inverse triples.
Consider the example in figure 2: it shows
the triples retrieved after searching for the word
computador (computer, in English). In most of
the retrieved triples, computador is a noun (e.g.
computador HIPONIMO DE ma?quina), but there
are relations where it is an adjective (e.g. com-
putador PROPRIEDADE DO QUE computar).
Moreover, as hypernymy relations are stored in
the form x HIPERONIMO DE y, some of the
triples presented, such as computador HIPON-
IMO DE ma?quina and computador HIPON-
IMO DE aparelho, have been inverted on the fly.
Furthermore, for each triple, Folheador
presents: a confidence value based on the mere
co-occurrence of the words in corpora; and
another based on the co-occurrence of the related
words instantiating discriminating patterns of the
particular relation.
3.2 Graph visualization
Currently, Folheador contains a very simple visu-
alization tool, which draws the semantic relation
graph established by the search results in a page,
as in figure 3.2. In the future, we aim to provide an
alternative for navigation based on textual links,
which would be made through the graph.
3.3 The use of corpora
One of the problems of most lexical resources is
that they do not integrate or contain frequency in-
37
Figure 2: Graph for the results in figure 2.
formation. This is especially true when one is not
simply listing words but going deeper into mean-
ing, and listing semantic properties like word
senses or relationships between senses.
So, a list of relations among words can con-
flate a number of highly specialized and obsolete
words (or word senses) that co-occur with im-
portant and productive relations in everyday use,
which is not a good thing for human and auto-
matic users alike. On the other hand, using cor-
pora allows one to add frequency information to
both participants in the relation and the triples
themselves, and thus provide another axis to the
description of words.
In addition, it is always interesting to observe
language use in context, especially in cases where
the user is not sure whether the relation is cor-
rect or still in use (and the user can and should
be fairly suspicious when s/he is browsing auto-
matically compiled information). A corpus check
therefore provides illustration, and confirmation,
to a user facing an unusual or surprising relation,
in addition to evaluation data for the relation cu-
rator or lexicographer. If these checks have been
done before by a set of human beings (as is the
case of VARRA (Freitas et al forthcomming)),
one can have much more confidence on the data
browsed, something that is important for users.
Having this in mind, besides allowing to query
for stored relational triples, Folheador is con-
nected to AC/DC (Santos and Bick, 2000; San-
tos, 2011), an online service that provides ac-
cess to a large set of Portuguese corpora. In just
one click, it is possible to query for all the sen-
tences in the AC/DC corpora connecting the argu-
ments of a retrieved triple. Figure 3.3 shows some
of the results for the words computador (com-
puter) and aparelho (apparatus). While some of
the returned sentences might contain the related
words co-occurring almost by chance or without
a clear semantic relation, other sentences validate
the triple (e.g. sentence par=saude16727 in fig-
ure 3.3). Sometimes, the sentences might as well
invalidate the triple.
Furthermore, for some of the relation types, it
is possible to connect to another online service,
VARRA (Freitas et al forthcomming), which is
based on a set of patterns that express some of the
relation types, in corpora text. After clicking on
the VARRA link, this service is queried for occur-
rences of the corresponding triple in AC/DC. The
presented sentences (a subset of those returned
by the previous service) will thus contain the re-
lated words connected by a discriminating pat-
tern for the relation they hold. Figure 3.3 shows
two sentences returned for the relation computa-
dor HIPONIMO DE ma?quina.
These patterns, as those proposed by Hearst
(1992) and used in many projects since, may not
be 100% reliable. So, VARRA was designed to
allow human users to classify the sentences ac-
cording to whether the latter validate the relation,
are just compatible with it, or not even that.
In fact, people do not usually write defini-
tions, especially when using common sense terms
in ordinary discourse. Thus, co-occurrence of
semantically-related terms frequently indicates a
particular relation only implicitly. The choice
of assessing sentences as good validators of a
semantic relation is related to the task of auto-
matically finding good illustrative examples for
dictionaries, which is a surprisingly complex
task (Rychly? et al 2008).
This kind of information, amassed with the
help of VARRA, is much more difficult to cre-
ate, but is of great value to Folheador, since it
provides good illustrative contexts for the related
lexical items.
4 Further work and concluding remarks
We have shown that, as it is, Folheador is very
useful, as it enables to browse for triples with
fixed arguments, it identifies the source of the
triples, and, in one click, it provides real sentences
38
Figure 3: AC/DC: some sentences returned for the related words computador and aparelho.
Figure 4: VARRA: sentences that exemplify the relation computador hyponym-of ma?quina.
where related lexical items co-occur. Still, we are
planning to implement new basic features, such as
the suggestion of words, when the searched word
is not in the LKB. Also, while currently Folheador
only directly connects to AC/DC and VARRA, in
order to increase its usability, we plan to connect it
automatically to online definitions and other ser-
vices available on the Web. We intend as well to
crosslink Folheador from the AC/DC interface, in
the sense that one can invoke Folheador also by
just one click (Santos, forthcomming).
Currently, Folheador gives access to 169,385
lexical items: 93,612 nouns, 38,409 verbs, 33,497
adjectives and 3,867 adverbs, in a total of 722,589
triples, and it can browse through the following
types of semantic relations: synonymy, hyper-
nymy, part-of, member-of, causation, producer-
of, purpose-of, place-of, and property-of. How-
ever, as the underlying resources, especially the
ones created automatically, will continue to be up-
dated, one important challenge is to create a ser-
vice that does not get outdated, by accompany-
ing the progress of these resources, ideally doing
an automatic update every month. Furthermore,
we believe that quantitative studies on the com-
parison and the aggregation of the integrated re-
sources should be made, deeper than what is pre-
sented in Gonc?alo Oliveira et al(2011).
We would like to end by emphasizing that we
are aware that the proper interpretation of the
semantic relations may vary in the different re-
sources, even disregarding possible mistakes in
the automatic harvesting. It is enough to consider
the (regular morphological) relation between a
verb and an adjective/noun ended in -dor in Por-
tuguese (and which can be paraphrased by one
who Vs). For instance, in relations such as {sofrer
- sofredor}, {correr - corredor}, {roer - roedor},
the kind of verb defines the kind of temporal re-
lation conveyed: a rodent is essentially roendo,
while a sofredor (sufferer) suffers hopefully in a
particular situation and can stop suffering, and a
corredor (runner) runs as job or as role.
The source code of Folheador is open source12,
so it may be used by other authors to explore their
knowledge bases. Technical information about
Folheador may be found in Costa (2011).

Abstract
When facing new fields, interpreters need to perform extensive searches for specialised
knowledge and terminology. They require this information prior to an interpretation and have
it accessible during the interpreting service. Fortunately, there are currently several terminology
management tools capable of assisting interpreters before and during an interpretation service.
Although these tools appear to be quite similar, they provide different kind of features and
as a result they exhibit different degrees of usefulness. This paper aims at describing current
terminology management tools with a view to establishing a set of features to assess the extent to
which terminology tools meet the specific needs of the interpreters. Subsequently, a comparative
analysis is performed to evaluate these tools based on the list of features previously identified.
1 Introduction
Professional interpreters frequently face different settings and specialised fields in their interpretation
services and yet they always need to provide excellent results. They might be called to work for
specialists that share a background knowledge that is totally or partially unknown to laypersons and/or
outsiders (Will, 2007). When interpreters lack the necessary background knowledge or experience, they
usually need to perform extensive searches for specialised knowledge and terminology in a very efficient
way in order to supply this deficit and acquire the required information.
Even though there are several modes of interpretation, depending mainly on the timing/delay of the
interpretation, the direction and the setting (cf. P?ochhacker, 2007), it is not possible for interpreters
to collect the relevant specialised information during the interpretation service itself. Interpreters are
required to find the necessary information prior to interpretation and have it accessible during the service,
even though they sometimes are able to carry out searches during the service.
According to Rodr??guez and Schnell (2009), terminology work is present in the whole process of
preparation prior to an interpretation service. For example, interpreters become familiar with the
subject field by searching for specialised documents, by extracting terms and looking for synonyms
and hyperonyms, by finding and developing acronyms and abbreviations and by compiling a glossary.
According to these authors, interpreters tend to compile in-house glossaries tailor to their individual
needs as the main way to prepare the terminology of a given interpretation.
2 Interpreters? Needs
The potentialities of computers for improving interpreters? working conditions was realised a long time
ago by Gile (1987). However, very little progress has been made so far. Costa, Corpas Pastor and Dur?an-
Mu?noz (2014) offer a tentative catalogue of current language technologies for interpreters, divided into
terminology tools for interpreters, note-taking applications for consecutive interpreting, applications for
voice recording and training tools. This paper focus exclusively on terminology tools for interpreters
with a view to performing a user evaluation.
As a rule, most interpreters seem to be unaware of the opportunities offered by language technologies.
As far as terminology is concerned, interpreters continue to store information and terminology on scraps

of paper or excel spreadsheets, while the use of technologies and terminology management tools is
still very low. A study conducted by Moser-Mercer (1992:507, quoted in Bilgen, 2009) rejected the
assumption that ?interpreters? needs are identical to those of translators and terminologists? and intended
to ?survey how conference interpreters handle terminology documentation and document control and to
offer some guidelines as to the interpretation-specific software tools for terminology and documentation
management?. The results of this study includes some key findings, such as the conclusion that most
of the respondents were interested in exchanging terminological information and that they were open
to using computers in their profession. According to these findings, Moser-Mercer (1992) highlighted
that ?software developers targeting the conference interpreting market must provide a tool that meets
the specific needs of the interpreters and not just market translation tools? (ibid:511). More recent
studies have also studied interpreters? current needs and practices regarding terminology management
(Rodr??guez and Schnell, 2009; Bilgen, 2009), and they also share the same findings: interpreters require
specific tools to meet their needs, which are different from translators and terminologists. According to
a survey conducted by Bilgen (2009), 85% of respondents are open to using computers, yet conventional
methods still prevail over the use of computerised methods of terminology management. The author
observed that respondents had no or little experience with terminology management software, and those
with some experience were most dissatisfied with the money and time they had to invest in them, and their
overall experience was mediocre (ibid:66). Respondents indicated that their priorities were different from
those identified in terminology literature in terms of terminological information stored, and the way in
which term records are structured. This is an important aspect that differentiates the needs of interpreters
and translators as regards definitions and contexts (Bilgen, 2009). Due to their working conditions,
translators usually prefer to consult multiple definitions and contexts to find the best solution for the
translation problem. On the contrary, interpreters will rarely have the time to go over multiple definitions,
contexts, etc. to find the right one, and thus, they will need to store the most concise information to be able
to consult it in the quickest and easiest way. Their responses in this survey also showed that the way they
retrieve terminological information was context-specific, and that there was also a significant variation
among individual interpreters. Flexibility is, therefore, of great importance to interpreters due to the
variation of their context-specific terminology management practices, and on their individual preferences
regarding the storage, organisation and retrieval of terminological information (ibid:92). Rodr??guez and
Schnell (2009), after a thorough analysis of interpreters? needs and in order to meet their requirements
as regards terminology management tools, propose the possibility of developing small databases that
vary according to the area of speciality or according to the conference and client. These mini-databases
would be multilingual and include an option allowing the interpreter to switch the source and target
languages. This assumption is in line with the Function Theory (Bergenholtz and Tarp, 2003; Tarp,
2008) and electronic multifunctional dictionaries (Spohr, 2009), which both defend the need to elaborate
terminological entries according to the potential users. Rodr??guez and Schnell (2009) recognise five
features that would distinguish the interpreters? mini-databases from the terminology databases intended
for translators: speed of consultation; intuitive navigation; possibility of updating the terminology record
in the interpretation booth; considerable freedom to define the basic structure; and multiple ways of
filtering data.
Accordingly, they also suggest the abandonment of the usual terminology methodology if the intention
is to provide interpreters with specific glossaries tailored to their needs. The authors advance the use of
a semasiological and associative methodology instead of the onomasiological approach, as ?it does not
adapt well to interpretation because the cognitive effort required by the onomasiological structures slows
down the interpretation process? (ibid).
3 Terminology Management Tools for Interpreters
There are some specialised computer and mobile software that can be used to quickly compile, store,
manage and search within glossaries. The most outstanding applications developed by/for interpreters
are described in detail below. They can be typically used to prepare an interpretation, in consecutive
interpreting or in a booth. These applications are quite similar to the look-up terminology tools currently
69
used by translators (Dur?an Mu?noz, 2012). In fact, some of them have been developed to cater for the
needs of both translators and interpreters. Due to the lack of space, this article is focused on standalone
applications, but other types of applications like Web-based (e.g. Interpreters? Help
1
) can also be used
for the same purposes (Ruetten, 2014).
Intragloss
2
is a commercial Mac OS X software created specifically to help interpreters when
preparing for an event by allowing them to manage glossaries. This application can be simply defined
as a glossary and document management tool created to help the interpreter prepare, use and merge
different glossaries with preparation documents, in more than 180 different languages. It allows to
import and export glossaries from and to plain text, Microsoft Word and Excel formats. Every glossary
imported to, or created in, is assigned to a domain glossary (considered the highest level of knowledge),
which contains all the glossaries from the sub-areas of knowledge, named ?assignments?. The creation
of an assignment glossary can be done in two different ways: either by extracting automatically all the
terms from the domain glossary that appear in the imported documents, or by highlighting a term in the
document, search for it on search sites (such as online glossaries, terminology databases, dictionaries and
general Web pages) and manually add the new translated term to the assignment glossary. It is important
to mention that the online search can be made within Intragloss. Another interesting feature is that
Intraglosss permits to copy assignment glossaries and assignment entries from one assignment to another.
The domain glossary may be multilingual as it can include several bilingual assignment glossaries. By
a way of example, if we have two assignment glossaries English/French and Dutch/English, in the same
domain, the domain glossary will be French/English/Dutch, i.e. multilingual. Finally, Intragloss also
allows to manually add meta-information to each glossary entry (see Fig. 1a).
In short, Intragloss is an intuitive and easy-to-use tool that facilitates the interpreters? terminology
management process by producing glossaries (imported or created ad hoc), by searching on several
websites simultaneously and by highlighting all the terms in the documents that appear in the domain
glossary. However, it is currently platform dependent and only works on Mac OS X platforms.
InterpretBank
3
is a simple terminology and knowledge management software tool designed both
for interpreters and translators using Windows and Android. It helps to manage, learn and look up
glossaries and term-related information. Due to its modular architecture (see Fig. 1b), it can be used
to guide the interpreter during the entire workflow process, starting from the creation and management
of multilingual glossaries (TermMode), passing through the study of these glossaries (MemoryMode),
and finally allowing the interpreter to look up terms while in a booth (ConferenceMode). InterpretBank
also has an Android version called InterpretBank Lite. This application is specifically designed to access
bi- or trilingual glossaries previously created with the desktop version. It is useful when working as a
consecutive, community or liaison interpreter, when a quick look up at the terminology list is necessary.
InterpretBank has a user-friendly, intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It allows us to import and export
glossaries in different formats (Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, simple text files, Android and TMEX)
and suggests translation candidates by taking advantage of online translation portal services, such as
Wikipedia, MyMemory and Bing. However, it is platform-dependent (it only works on Windows and
Android), does not handle documents, only glossaries and requires a commercial license.
Interplex UE
4
is a user-friendly multilingual glossary management programme that can be used easily
and quickly in a booth while the interpreter is working. Instead of keeping isolated word lists, it allows
to group all terms relating to a particular subject or field into multilingual glossaries that can be searched
in an instant. As we can see in Fig. 1c, this programme permits to have several glossaries open at the
same time, which is a very useful feature if the working domain is covered by more than one glossary.
Similar to the previous analysed programmes, Interplex UE also allows to import and export glossaries
from and to Microsoft Word, Excel, and simple text files. Interplex UE runs on Windows; nevertheless, it
has a simpler version for iOS devices, one named Interplex Lite, for iPhone and iPod Touch, and another
named Interplex HD, for iPad. Both glossaries and multi-glossary searchers offer the functionality of

viewing expressions in each of the defined languages.
In general, Interplex UE has a user-friendly interface and it is regularly updated. It allows to import
and export glossaries from and to Microsoft Word and Excel formats. However, it, too, is platform
dependent (only works on Windows and iOS), does not handle documents, only glossaries, and requires
a commercial license.

SDL MultiTerm Desktop
5
is a commercial terminology management tool developed for Windows
that provides one solution to store and manage multilingual terminology. MultiTerm was first launched
in 1990 by Trados GmbH but in 2005 the company was acquired by SDL
6
, which renamed MultiTerm to
SDL MultiTerm. Today, SDL MultiTerm is a terminology management tool commercialised by SDL as
a standalone application, which has been improved according to the translators? needs. Alternatively,
MultiTerm can be used within the SDL Trados Studio
7
as an integrated tool. As translators can
5

6
www.sdl.com
7
www.sdl.com/products/sdl-trados-studio
71
easily edit and add terminology within SDL Trados Studio, MultiTerm helps to improve the efficiency
of the translation process and promotes high-quality translated content with real-time verification of
multilingual terminology. This application is very complete because it allows to store an unlimited
number of terms in a vast number of languages; imports and exports glossaries from and to different
technology environments, such as Microsoft Excel, XML, TBX and several other proprietary formats;
permits to manually add a variety of meta-data information, such as synonyms, context, definitions,
associated project, part-of-speech tags, URLs, etc. Apart from the previous mentioned descriptive fields,
MultiTerm also allows the user to insert illustrations to the terms in the terminology database (which can
be stored either locally or, for collaborative purposes, in a remote server). It is important to mention that
this visual reference feature is very useful specially to interpreters and translators dealing with unfamiliar
terms. Moreover, MultiTerm has an advanced search feature that permits to search not only the indexed
terms but also in their descriptive fields, or create filters to make custom searches within specific fields,
like language, definition, part-of-speech, etc. Nevertheless, the most interesting feature about MultiTerm
is its concept-oriented feature, i.e. each entry in MultiTerm corresponds to a single concept, which can
be described by different terms in both source and target language. This detail is very important because
it allows the user to centralise and customise the terms with more information, such as different possible
translations and their corresponding contexts (see Fig. 1d).
In general, MultiTerm can be seen as an advanced multilingual terminology tool with an intuitive
and easy-to-use interface. Although MultiTerm was originally designed for translators, it can also be
used by interpreters. Its main advantage to interpreters, when compared with other terminology tools, is
twofold: it allows to add several translation terms in one entry and permits to customise a wide variety
of descriptive fields, such as illustrations, associated projects, definitions, etc. However, it can only be
used on Windows, does not handle documents and there is no demo version available.
AnyLexic
8
is an easy-to-use terminology management tool developed for Windows with a simple
and intuitive interface. It was not designed to tie any particular terminological requirement, instead it
aims to help the interpreter prepare, use and manage different glossaries or dictionaries. AnyLexic can
be described as a robust terminology management tool, as it enables users to easily create and manage
multiple mono-, bi- or multilingual glossaries in any language and to import and export glossaries from
and to Microsoft Excel, plain text and AnyLexic Exchange Format (AEF). In addition, each entry in the
glossary can have multiple translation equivalents in the target language along with notes. The search
for records in the database allow users to combine different options, such as search for all source terms
or translation candidates and associated notes. In addition, the search can be performed within one or
multiple glossaries (see Fig. 1e). Another interesting feature in AnyLexic is the way that records can be
displayed using different templates with configurable text colour, background colour, font size and text
format. Besides, it is possible to create our own template for displaying the records. With the purpose
of simplifying the teamwork process, this tool has an additional option to exchange any glossary with
other AnyLexic users by either using the AEF proprietary format or by accessing a remote glossary, a
very useful feature when co-operating with other interpreters or translators on a project.
In general, AnyLexic is an easy and convenient terminology database managing software for working
with terminology, creating, editing and exchanging glossaries when working under one project both
alone or with other working partners. However, it only works on Windows platforms and even though an
evaluation version is available for 30 days, it requires a commercial license.
Lingo
9
is a commercial Windows terminology management tool designed to create and manage
terminology databases, whether mono- or multilingual. It can import from and export to TMX and plain
text. Its main features are: creation and management of any number of specialised glossaries/dictionaries
in any language; can handle large files (i.e. over 50K entries); it allows users to have several glossaries
open at the same time; and it has a rapid and easily configurable search functionality that can be
customised to search for all terms, translation candidates and associated descriptive fields, either in all
glossaries or in a specific one. Another interesting feature is the drag and drop functionality, which
8
www.anylexic.com
9
www.lexicool.com/soft_lingo2.asp
72
allows to easily insert words into Microsoft documents, for instance.
As we can see in Fig. 1f, Lingo is a simple and user-friendly software that offers an effective way
to create and manage multilingual glossaries in any language. Additionally, it permits to manually add
an infinite number of customised fields into each entry, such as definitions, URLs, synonyms, antonyms,
contextual information, notes or any other desirable field. However, it is platform dependent and does
not import from or export to common formats like Microsoft Word or Excel.
UniLex
10
is a free terminology management tool created by Acolada GmbH for Windows. It aims
to help interpreters and translators prepare, use and manage bilingual glossaries or dictionaries in
approximately 30 different languages. UniLex offers a variety of search functions and the possibility
to combine user glossaries or dictionaries with a full range of dictionaries available in the UniLex series
(e.g. Blaha: Pocket Dictionary of Automobile Technology German/English), which can be acquired
as single user versions or as network versions for collaborative purposes. UniLex can also be used in
a network environment, which allows users to exchange glossaries or dictionaries. Nevertheless, this
additional feature requires a commercial license.
In general, UniLex is not only capable of managing user bilingual glossaries or dictionaries, but
also dictionary titles from renowned publishers, which are sold by the company to be consulted within
UniLex. However, it only works on Windows and does not handle multilingual glossaries.
The Interpreter?s Wizard
11
is a free iPad application capable of managing bilingual glossaries in a
booth. It is a simple, fast and easy-to-use application that helps the interpreter to search and visualise
terminology in seconds. The system includes rapid and easily configurable search functionality that
can be customised to search for all terms, translation candidates either in all glossaries or in a specific
one. Nevertheless, all the imported glossaries need to be previously created and converted online to the
proprietary format, and it does not allow users to export glossaries.
3.1 Comparative Analysis
Despite the aforementioned terminology tools can be used to prepare a given interpretation according
to the interpreters? requirements identified in section 2, these systems differ from one another in their
functionalities, practical issues and degrees of user-friendliness. Therefore, it is necessary to establish
a set of specific and measurable features that permit us to assess and distinguish the different tools
concerning users? needs in such a way that the results would be useful for both potential users as well
as to the designers of such systems. Departing from the conclusions drawn from the literature review
(see section 2) and the description of the terminology tools analysed in section 3, we provide in this
section an analysis of these tools based on our own practical set of measurable features. For instance, the
?freedom to define the basic structure? identified by Rodr??guez and Schnell (2009) was reformulated into
several practical measurable features, such as ?N
o
of descriptive fields?, ?N
o
of working languages? and
?N
o
of languages per glossary?. Moreover, the possibility of ?developing multilingual mini-databases?,
also identified in their study, was reconsidered as measurable features by means of the following criteria:
?Manages multiple glossaries? and ?N
o
of languages per glossary?. Another example is the ?Remote
Glossary Exchange? measurable feature, which was inferred from the study conducted by Bilgen (2009),
who identified the need to exchange terminological information.
After a careful analysis of the priorities for the design and features to be included in a terminology
management tool for interpreters, 15 features were identified, 5 of which were classified as fundamental
to a terminology tool (10 points) and 10 as secondary (5 points). Then, these features were used
to evaluate the eight tools presented in section 3 and to investigate which one is the most complete.
The first considered feature clarifies if the tools were designed to handle multiple glossaries in their
interfaces at same time (Manages multiple glossaries). The next two features are somehow related. The
N
o
of possible working languages describes how many different working languages are permitted by
the application. Then, considering these working languages, how many of them can be used at the
same time per glossary (N
o
of languages per glossary allowed). The next feature is related with

all types of descriptive fields that these tools allow to add to each glossary entry (N
o
of descriptive
fields). The possibility of managing terminology with preparation documents (Handles documents) is
another relevant feature for interpreters seeking for tools capable of highlighting terms in documents,
for example. Equally import is the Unicode support (Unicode compatibility) as it provides a unique
number for every character, no matter what the platform, the program, or the language is. In other
words, an application that supports full Unicode means that it has support for any ASCII or non-ASCII
language, such as Hebrew or Russian, two non-ASCII languages. Imports from and Exports to, as its
name suggests, represents the supported input and output formats. The Embedded online search for
translation candidates is a relevant add-in for terminology tools, as it permits to focus the search for
terminological candidates within the tool. Despite the fact that all the tools have English as a default
language, the support of multiple languages (Interface?s supported languages) is another important
feature as it allows to increase the number of potential users that a terminology tool can reach. The
Remote glossary exchange feature is important when co-operating with other working partners remotely
is required. The next three features are related with the available documentation, their availability and
platform dependency (Well-documented, Availability and Operating System(s), respectively). Finally,
the last row presents some unique characteristics along with some relevant comments (Other relevant
features).
Based on this comparative analysis, none of the investigated terminology tools exhibit all the proposed
features. Nevertheless, SDL MultiTerm and Intragloss are the best classified with 77 and 69 points out
of 100, respectively. This is not surprising because SDL MultiTerm is the most expensive tool nowadays
available on the market and, apart from that, it has been developed for more than 20 years. Its flexibility
to easily store, manage and search for multilingual terminology and definitions is just an example of
the features that meet the specific needs of an interpreter. The score of Intragloss, released last year
as a beta version, is neither surprising due to its novelty and design purposes, i.e. it was developed by
interpreters for interpreters and thus corresponds better to their needs. On the other hand, UniLex and The
Interpreter?s Wizard tools got the worst scores due to the lack of features offered. About the remaining
tools (AnyLexic, Lingo, InterpretBank and Intraplex) we can say that they have similar features, which
resulted in similar scores (64, 61, 60 and 55, respectively).
4 Conclusion
This paper presents an overview of the most relevant features that terminology management tools should
have in order to help interpreters before and during the interpretation process. Eight terminology tools
are discussed and a comparative analysis is performed to evaluate them on the bases of the set of features
previously identified. This comparative analysis not only aims at highlighting some of the features that
interpreters can expect from the currently available terminology management tools on the market, but
also intended to help them choose a specific tool for a given interpretation project. Table 1 provides
interpreters with a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the currently available terminology tools
on the market. It is envisaged to serve as a concise guide to help interpreters choose the terminology
management tool that best caters for their specific needs, in order to help them work more efficiently,
store and share terminology more easily, as well as save time when a looking for a specific feature most
suited to a specific interpreting service.
Although most of the analysed tools could be considered to be very flexible when searching for
terminology within glossaries, it appears that none of them fulfil all needs of interpreters. It is worth
mentioning that some tools require a steep learning curve while others imply a significant financial
investment (e.g. Lingo and SDL MultiTerm, respectively). Moreover, some tools are fairly basic and
more orientated towards creating and managing bilingual or multilingual glossaries rather than more
comprehensive terminology records with supporting information (e.g. UniLex and The Interpreter?s
