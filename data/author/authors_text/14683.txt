Abstract
This paper presents our work for participation
in the 2010 CIPS-ParsEval shared task on Chi-
nese syntactic constituent tree parsing. We
use dependency parsers for this constituent
parsing task based on a formal dependency-
constituent transformation method which con-
verts dependency to constituent structures us-
ing a machine learning approach. A condi-
tional random fields (CRF) tagger is adopted
for head information recognition. Our ex-
periments shows that acceptable parsing and
head tagging results are obtained on our ap-
proaches.
1 Introduction
Constituent parsing is a challenging but useful task
aiming at analyzing the constituent structure of a sen-
tence. Recently, it is widely adopted by the popular ap-
plications of natural language processing techniques,
such as machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005),
synonym generation (Shinyama et al, 2002), relation
extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and lexical re-
source augmentation (Snow et al, 2004). A great deal
of researches have been conducted on this topic with
promising progress (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1999;
Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Sagae
and Lavie, 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Finkel et al,
2008; Huang, 2008).
Recently, several effective dependency parsing al-
gorithms has been developed and shows excellent per-
formance in the responding parsing tasks (McDonald,
2006; Nivre and Scholz, 2004). Since graph struc-
tures of dependency and constituent parsing over a
sentence are strongly related, they should be benefited
from each other. It is true that constituent parsing may
be smoothly altered to fit dependency parsing. How-
ever, due to the inconvenience from dependency to
constituent structure, it is not so easy to adopt the latter
?This work is partially supported by the National Natu-
ral Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 60903119, Grant
No. 60773090 and Grant No. 90820018), the National Ba-
sic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2009CB320901),
and the National High-Tech Research Program of China
(Grant No.2008AA02Z315).
for the former. This means that most of these popular
and effective dependency parsing models can not be di-
rectly extended to constituents parsing. This paper pro-
poses an formal method for such a conversion which
adoptively solves the problem of ambiguity. Based on
the proposed method, a dependency parsing algorithm
can be used to solve tasks of constituent parsing.
A part of Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) (Zhou,
2004; Zhou, 2007; Chen et al, 2008) is used as
the training and test data for the 2010 CIPS-ParsEval
shared task. Being different from the annotation
scheme of the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB), the TCT
has another annotation scheme, which combines both
the constituent tree structure and the head informa-
tion of each constituent. Specifically, there can be al-
ways multiple heads in a constituent. For the 2010
CIPS-ParsEval shared task, only segmented sentences
are given in test data without part-of-speech (POS)
tags, a POS tagger is required for this task. There-
fore, we divide our system into three major cascade
stages, namely POS tagging, constituent parsing and
head information recognition, which are connected as
a pipeline of processing. For the POS tagging, we
adopt the SVMTool tagger (Gimenez and Marquez,
2004); for the constituent parsing, we use the Maxi-
mum Spanning Tree (MST) (McDonald, 2006) parser
combined with a dependencies-to-constituents conver-
sion; and for the head information recognition, we ap-
ply a sequence labeling method to label head informa-
tion.
Section 2 presents the POS tagger in our approach.
The details of our parsing method is presented in sec-
tion 3. The head information recognition is described
in section 4. The data and experimental results are
shown in section 5. The last section is the conclusion
and future work.
2 POS Tagging
The SVMTool tagger (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004) is
used as our POS tagging tool for the first stage. It is a
POS tagger based on SVM classifier, written in Perl. It
can be trained on standardized collection of hand POS-
tagged sentences. It uses SVM-Light1 toolkit as the
1http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/
svm_light/.
implementation of SVM classifier and achieves 97.2%
accuracy on the Penn English Treebank. We test the
accuracy of the SVMTool tagger on the development
set of the TCT (see section 5.1) and achieve accuracy
of 94.98%.
3 Parsing Constituents Using
Dependency Parsing Algorithms
3.1 Convert Dependencies to Constituents
The conversion from constituent to dependency struc-
tures is straightforward with some specific rules based
on linguistic theory. However, there is not an effective
method which can accurately accomplish the opposite
transformation, from the dependency structures back
into constituent ones due to the existence of ambiguity
introduced by the former transformation.
Aimed at the above difficulty, our solution is to in-
troduce a formal dependency structure and a machine
learning method so that the ambiguity from depen-
dency structures to constituent structures can be dealt
with automatically.
3.1.1 Binarization
We first transform constituent trees into the form
that all productions for all subtrees are either unary or
binary, before converting them to dependency struc-
tures. Due to the binarization, the target constituent
trees of the conversion from dependency back to con-
stituent structures are binary branching.
This binarization is done by the left-factoring ap-
proach described in (Charniak et al, 1998; Petrov and
Klein, 2008), which converts each production with n
children, where n > 2, into n? 1 binary productions.
Additional non-terminal nodes introduced in this con-
version must be clearly marked. Transforming the bi-
nary branching trees into arbitrary branching trees is
accomplished by using the reverse process.
3.1.2 Using Binary Classifier
We train a classifier to decide which dependency
edges should be transformed first at each step of con-
version automatically. After the binarization described
in the previous section, only one dependency edge
should be transformed at each step. Therefore the
classifier only need to decide which dependency edge
should be transformed at each step during the conver-
sion.
As a result of the projective property of constituent
structures, this problem only happens in the cases that
modifiers are at both sides of their heads. And for these
cases that one head has multiple modifiers, only the
leftmost or the rightmost dependency edge could be
transformed first. Therefore, a binary classifier is al-
ways enough for the disambiguation at each step.
1. Word form of the parent
2. Part-of-speech (POS) tag of the parent
3. Word form of the leftmost child
4. POS tag of the leftmost child
5. Dependency label of the leftmost child
6. Word form of the rightmost child
7. POS tag of the rightmost child
8. Dependency label of the rightmost child
9. Distance between the leftmost child and
the parent
10. Distance between the rightmost child
and the parent
Table 1: Features used for conversion classifier.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted as the
learning algorithm for the binary classifier and the fea-
tures are in Table 1.
3.1.3 Convert Constituent Labels
The rest problem is that we should restore the label
for each constituent when dependency structure trees
are again converted to constituent structures. The prob-
lem is solved by storing constituent labels as labels of
dependency types. The label for each constituent is just
used as the label dependency type for each dependency
edge.
The conversion method is tested on the develop-
ment, too. Constituent trees are firstly converted into
dependency structures using the head rules described
in (Li and Zhou, 2009). Then, we transform those
trees back to constituent structure using our conversion
method and use the PARSEVAL (Black et al, 1991)
measures to evaluate the performance of the conver-
sion method. Our conversion method obtains 99.76%
precision and 99.76% recall, which is a great perfor-
mance.
3.2 Dependency Parser for Constituent Parsing
Based on the proposed conversion method, depen-
dency parsing algorithms can be used for constituent
parsing. This can be done by firstly transforming train-
ing data from constituents into dependencies and ex-
tract training instances to train a binary classifier for
dependency-constituent conversion, then training a de-
pendency parser using the transformed training data.
On the test step, parse the test data using the depen-
dency parser and convert output dependencies to con-
stituents using the binary classifier trained in advance.
In addition, since our conversion method needs depen-
dency types, labeled dependency parsing algorithms
are always required.
1. Constituent label of the constituent
2. Constituent label of each child of
the constituent.
3. Wether it is a terminal for each
child of the constituent
4. The leftmost word in the sentence
of each child of the constituent.
5. The leftmost word in the sentence
of each child of the constituent.
Table 2: CRF features for head information recogni-
tion.
1. Word form and POS tag of the parent.
2. Word form and POS tag of each child.
3. POS tag of the leftmost child of each child.
4. POS tag of the rightmost child of each child.
5. Dependency label between the parent and
its parent
Table 3: CRF features for dependency type labeling.
4 Head Information Recognition
Since head information of each constituent is always
determined by the syntactic label of its own and the
categories of the constituents in subtrees, the order and
relations between the productions of each constituent
strongly affects the head information labeling. It is
natural to apply a sequential labeling strategy to tackle
this problem. The linear chain CRF model is adopted
for the head information labeling, and the implemen-
tation of CRF model we used is the 0.53 version of
the CRF++ toolkit2. We assume that head information
is independent between different constituents, which
could decrease the length of sequence to be labeled for
the CRF model.
We use a binary tag set to determine whether a con-
stituent is a head, e.g. H for a head, O for a non-head,
which is the same as (Song and Kit, 2009). The fea-
tures in Table 2 are used for CRF model.
To test our CRF tagger, we remove all head informa-
tion from the development set, and use the CRF tagger
to retrieve the head. The result strongly proves its ef-
fectiveness by showing an accuracy of 99.52%.
5 Experiments
All experiments reported here were performed on a
Core 2 Quad 2.83Ghz CPU with 8GB of RAM.
2The CRF++ toolkit is publicly available from
http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/.
5.1 Data
There are 37,219 short sentences in official released
training data for the first sub-task and 17,744 long sen-
tences for the second sub-task (for the second sub-task,
one line in the training data set may contain more than
one sentence). We split one eighth of the data as our
development set. On the other hand, there are both
1,000 sentences in released test data for the first and
second sub-tasks.
5.2 Constituent Parsing
As mentioned in section 3, constituent parsing is
done by using a dependency parser combined with
our conversion method. We choose the second or-
der maximum spanning tree parser with k-best online
large-margin learning algorithm (Crammer and Singer,
2003; Crammer et al, 2003). The MST parser we use
is in the form of an open source program implemented
in C++3.
The features used for MST parser is the same as
(McDonald, 2006). Both the single-stage and two-
stage dependency type labeling approaches are applied
in our experiments. For the two-stage dependency type
labeling, The linear chain CRF model is adopted in-
stead of the first-order Markov model used in (McDon-
ald, 2006). The features in Table 3 are used for CRF
model. It takes about 7 hours for training the MST
parser, and about 24 hours for training the CRF model.
As mentioned in section 3.1.2, SVM is adopted as
the learning algorithm for the binary classifier. There
are about 40,000 training instances in the first sub-task
and about 80,000 in the second sub-task. Develop-
ment sets are used for tuning parameter C of SVM
and the training time of the SVM classifier for the first
and second sub-task is about 8 and 24 hours, respec-
tively. However, the conversion from dependencies to
constituents is extremely fast. Converting more than
2,000 trees takes less than 1 second.
To transform the constituent trees in training set into
dependency structures, we use the head rules of (Li and
Zhou, 2009).
5.3 Results
The evaluation metrics used in 2010 CIPS-ParsEval
shared task is shown in following:
1. syntactic parsing
Precision = number of correct constituents in proposed parsenumber of constituents in proposed parse
Recall = number of correct constituents in proposed parsenumber of constituents in standard parse

two-stage 63.14 62.48
Table 5: Official scores of event recognition
The correctness of syntactic constituents is judged
based on the following two criteria:
(a) the boundary, the POS tags of all the words
in the constituent and the constituent type la-
bel should match that of the constituent in
the gold standard data.
(b) the boundary, the POS tags of all the words
in the constituent, the constituent type la-
bel and head child index of the constituent
should match that of the constituent in the
gold standard data. (if the constituent con-
tains more than one head child index, at least
one of them should be correct.)
2. event pattern recognition
Micro-R = number of all correct events in proposed parsenumber of all events in standard parse
Macro-R = sum of recall of different target verbsnumber of target verbs
Here the event pattern of a sentence is defined to
be the sequence of event blocks controlled by the
target verb in a sentence. The criteria for judging
the correctness of event pattern recognition is:
? the event pattern should be completely con-
sistent with gold standard data (information
of each event block should completely match
and the order of event blocks should also
consistent).
There are both two submissions for the first and sec-
ond sub-tasks. One is using the single-stage depen-
dency type labeling and the other is two-stage. Since
there are some mistakes in our models for the second
sub-task, the results of our submissions are unexpect-
edly poor and are not shown in this paper. All the re-
sults in this paper is reported by the official organizer
of the 2010 CIPS-ParsEval shared task.
The accuracy of POS tagging on the official test data
is 92.77%. The results of syntactic parsing for the first
sub-task is shown in Table 4. And results of event
recognition is shown in Table 5.
From the Table 4 and 5, we can see that our system
achieves acceptable parsing and head tagging results,
and the results of event recognition is also reasonably
high.
5.4 Comparison with Previous Works
We comparison our approach with previous works of
2009 CIPS-ParsEval shared task. The data set and
evaluation measures of 2009 CIPS-ParsEval shared
task, which are quite different from that of 2010 CIPS-
ParsEval shared task, are used in this experiment for
the comparison purpose. Table 6 shows the compari-
son.
We compare our method with several main parsers
on the official data set of 2009 CIPS-ParsEval shared
task. All these results are evaluated with official
evaluation tool by the 2009 CIPS-ParsEval shared
task. Bikel?s parser4 (Bikel, 2004) in Table 6 is
a implementation of Collins? head-driven statistical
model (Collins, 2003). The Stanford parser5 is based
on the factored model described in (Klein and Man-
ning, 2002). The Charniak?s parser6 is based on the
parsing model described in (Charniak, 2000). Berke-
ley parser7 is based on unlexicalized parsing model de-
scribed in (Petrov and Klein, 2007). According to Ta-
ble 6, the performance of our method is better than all
the four parsers described above. Chen et al (2009)
and Jiang et al (2009) both make use of combination
of multiple parsers and achieve considerably high per-
formance.

6 Conclusion
This paper describes our approaches for the parsing
task in CIPS-ParsEval 2010 shared task. A pipeline
system is used to solve the POS tagging, constituent
parsing and head information recognition. SVMTool
tagger is used for the POS tagging. For constituent
parsing, we proposes a conversion based method,
which can use dependency parsers for constituent pars-
ing. MST parser is chosen as our dependency parser.
A CRF tagger is used for head information recognition.
The official scores indicate that our system obtains ac-
ceptable results on constituent parsing and high perfor-
mance on head information tagging.
One of future work should apply parser combination
and reranking approaches to leverage this in producing
more accurate parsers.

Abstract
We in this paper present the model for our
participation (BCMI) in the CoNLL-2012
Shared Task. This paper describes a pure
rule-based method, which assembles dif-
ferent filters in a proper order. Different
filters handle different situations and the
filtering strategies are designed manually.
These filters are assigned to different or-
dered tiers from general to special cases.
We participated in the Chinese and En-
glish closed tracks, scored 51.83 and 59.24
respectively.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we describes the approaches we u-
tilized for our participation in the CoNLL-2012
Shared Task. This year?s shared task targets at
modeling coreference resolution for multiple lan-
guages. Following (Lee et al, 2011), we extend-
s the methodology of deterministic coreference
model, using manually designed rules to rec-
ognize expressions with corresponding entities.
The deterministic coreference model (Raghu-

nathan et al, 2010) has shown good perfor-
mance in the shared task of CoNLL-2011. This
kind of model focuses on filtering with ordered
tiers: One filter is applied at one time, from
highest to lowest precision. However, compared
with learning approaches (Soon et al, 2001), s-
ince effective rules are quite heterogeneous in
different languages, several filtering methods
should be redesigned when different languages
are considered. We modified the original Stan-
ford English coreference system1 to adapt to the
Chinese scenario. For the English participation,
we implemented the full strategies and interface
of the semantic-based filters which are not ob-
tained from the open source toolkit.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
In Section 2, we review the related work; In Sec-
tion 3, we describe the detail of our model of
handling coreference resolution in Chinese; Ex-
periment results are reported in Section 4 and
the conclusion is presented in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Many existing works have been published on
learning relation extractors via supervised (Soon
et al, 2001) or unsupervised (Haghighi and K-
lein, 2010; Poon and Domingos, 2008) approach-
es. For involving semantics, (Rahman and Ng,
2011) proposed a coreference resolution model
with world knowledge; By using word associa-
tions, (Kobdani et al, 2011) showed its effec-
tiveness to coreference resolution. Compared

with machine learning methods, (Raghunathan
et al, 2010) proposed rule-base models which
have been witnessed good performance.
Researchers began to work on Chinese coref-
erence resolution at a comparatively late date
and most of them adopt a machine learning
approach. (Guochen and Yunfei, 2005) based
their Chinese personal pronoun coreference res-
olution system on decision trees and (Naiquan et
al., 2009) realized a Chinese coreference resolu-
tion system based on maximum entropy model.
(Weixuan et al, 2010) proposes a SVM-based
approach to anaphora resolution of noun phrases
in Chinese and achieves the F-measure of 63.3%
in the evaluation on ACE 2005. (Guozhi et al,
2011) presented a model for personal pronouns
anaphora resolution based on corpus,which us-
ing rule pretreatment combined with maximum
entropy.
3 Model for Chinese
In general, we adapt Stanford English corefer-
ence system to Chinese by making necessary
changes. The sketch of this deterministic model
is to extract mentions and relevant information
firstly; then several manually designed rules, or
filtering sieves are applied to identify the corefer-
ence. Moreover, these sieves are utilized in a pre-
designed order, which are sorted from highest to
lowest precision. The ordered filtering sieves are
listed in Table 1.
Ordered Sieves
1. Mention Detection Sieve
2. Discourse Processing Sieve
3. Exact String Match Sieve
4. Relaxed String Match Sieve
5. Precise Constructs Sieve
6. Head Matching Sieves
7. Proper Head Word Match Sieve
8. Pronouns Sieve
9. Post-Processing Sieve
Table 1: Ordered filtering sieves for Chinese. Modi-
fied sieves are bold.
We remove the semantic-based sieves due to
the resource constraints. The simplified version
consists of nine filtering sieves. The bold ones
in Table 1 are the modified sieves for Chinese.
First of all, we adopt the head finding rules for
Chinese used in (Levy and Manning, 2003), and
this affects sieve 4, 6 and 7 which are all take
advantage of the head words. And our change
to other sieves are described as follows.
? Mention Detection Sieve: We in this
sieve first extract all the noun phrases,
pronouns (the words with part-of-speech
(POS) tag PN), proper nouns (the word-
s with POS tag NR) and named entities.
Thus a mention candidate set is produced.
We then refine this set by removing several
types of candidates listed as follows:
1. Themeasure words, a special word pat-
tern in Chinese such as ? ?? (a year
of), ???? (a ton of).
2. Cardinals, percents and money.
3. A mention if a larger mention with the
same head word exists.
? Discourse Processing & Pronouns
Sieve: In these two sieves, we adapt
the common pronouns to Chinese. It in-
cludes ?\? (you), ??? (I or me),?? (he
or him),??? (she or her),??? (it),?\??
(plural of ?you?), ???? (we or us),???
(they, gender: male),???? (they, gender:
female),???? (plural of ?it?) and relative
pronoun ?gC? (self). Besides these, we
enrich the pronouns set by adding ?4?, ?4
??, ? T? and ?T?? which are more often
to appear in spoken dialogs as first person
pronouns and ? s? which is used to show
respect for ?you? and the third person pro-
noun ???.
Besides, for mention processing of the original
system, whether a mention is singular or plural
should be given. Different from English POS
tags, in Chinese plural nouns couldn?t be distin-
guished from single nouns in terms of the POS.
Therefore, we add two rules to judge whether a
noun is plural or not.
? A noun that ends with ??? (plural marker
for pronouns and a few animate nouns), and
?? (and so on) is plural.
96
? A noun phrase that involves the coordinat-
ing conjunction words such as ? ?? (and)
is plural.
4 Experiments
4.1 Modification for the English system
We implement the semantic-similarity sieves
proposed in (Lee et al, 2011) with the WordNet.
These modifications consider the alias sieve and
lexical chain sieve. For the alias sieve, two men-
tions are marked as aliases if they appear in the
same synset in WordNet. For the lexical chain
sieve, two mentions are marked as coreference if
linked by a WordNet lexical chain that traverses
hypernymy or synonymy relations.

and because spurious mentions will be left as s-
ingletons and removed at last, a low precision
will not affect the final result. The performance
of mention detection for Chinese is worse than
that of English, and this is a direction for future
improvement for Chinese.
Our results on the development set for both
languages are listed in Table 4 and the official
test results are in Table 5. Avg F1 is the arith-
metic mean of MUC, B3, and CEAFE.
We further examine the performance by test-
ing on different data types (broadcast con-
versations, broadcast news, magazine articles,
newswire, conversational speech, and web da-
ta) of the development set, and the results are
shown in Table 6. The system do better on bn,
mz, tc than bc, nw, wb for both Chinese and
English. And it performs the worst on wb due
to a relative lower recall in mention detection.
For Chinese, we also compare the performance
when handling the three different mention types,
proper nominal, pronominal, and other nominal.
Table 7 shows the scores output by the official
scorer when only each kind of mentions are pro-
vided in the keys file and response file each time
and both the quality of the coreference links a-
mong the nominal of each mention type and the
corresponding performance of mention detection
are presented. The performance of coreference
resolution among proper nominal and pronomi-
nal is significant higher than that of other nom-
inal which highly coincides with the results in
Table 6.

5 Conclusion
We presented the rule-base approach for the BC-
MI?s participation in the shared task of CoNLL-
2012. We extend the work by (Lee et al, 2011)
and modified several tiers to adapt to Chinese.
Numerical results show the effectiveness in the
evaluation for Chinese and English. For the
Chinese scenario, we firstly show it is possible
to consider special POS-tags and common pro-
nouns as indicators for improving the perfor-
mance. This work could be extended by involv-
ing more feasible filtering tiers or utilizing some
automatic rule generating methods.
