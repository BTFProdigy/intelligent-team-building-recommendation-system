Abstract
We describe the system of the PIKB team
for BioNLP?09 Shared Task 1, which targets
tunable domain-independent event extraction.
Our approach is based on a three-stage clas-
sification: (1) trigger word tagging, (2) sim-
ple event extraction, and (3) complex event
extraction. We use the MIRA framework for
all three stages, which allows us to trade pre-
cision for increased recall by appropriately
changing the loss function during training. We
report results for three systems focusing on re-
call (R = 28.88%), precision (P = 65.58%),
and F1-measure (F1 = 33.57%), respectively.
1 Introduction
Molecular interactions have been the focus of inten-
sive research in the development of in-silico biology.
Recent developments like the Pathway and Interac-
tion Knowledge Base (PIKB) aim to make available
to the user the large semantics of the existing molec-
ular interactions data using massive knowledge syn-
dication. PIKB is part of LinkedLifeData1, a plat-
form for semantic data integration based on RDF2
syndication and lightweight reasoning.
Our system is based on the MIRA framework
where, by appropriately changing the loss function
on training, we can achieve any desirable balance
between precision and recall. For example, low pre-
cision with high recall would be appropriate in a
search that aims to identify as many potential candi-
dates as possible to be further examined by the user,
1http://www.linkedlifedata.com
2http://www.w3.org/RDF/
while high precision might be essential when adding
relations to a knowledge base. Such a tunable sys-
tem is practical for a variety of important tasks, in-
cluding but not limited to, populating extracted facts
in PIKB and reasoning on top of new and old data.
Our system is based on a three-stage classification
process: (1) trigger word tagging using a linear se-
quence model, (2) simple event extraction, and (3)
complex event extraction. In stage (2), we generate
relations between a trigger word and one or more
proteins, while in stage (3), we look for complex in-
teractions between simple events, trigger words and
proteins. We use MIRA for all three stages with a
loss function tuned for high recall.
2 One-best MIRA and Loss Functions
In what follows, xi will denote a generic input sen-
tence, and yi will be the ?gold? labeling of xi. For
each pair of a sentence xi and a labeling y, we com-
pute a vector-valued feature representation f(xi, y).
Given a weight vector w, the dot-product w ? f(x, y)
ranks the possible labelings y of x; we will denote
the top scoring labeling as yw(x). As with hidden
Markov models (Rabiner, 1989), yw(x) can be com-
puted efficiently for suitable feature functions using
dynamic programming.
The learning portion of our method requires find-
ing a weight vector w that scores the correct labeling
of the training data higher than any incorrect label-
ing. We used a one-best version of MIRA (Cram-
mer, 2004; McDonald et al, 2005) to choose w.
MIRA is an online learning algorithm that updates
the weight vector w for each training sentence xi
according to the following rule:
95
wnew = argmin
w
?w ? wold?
s.t. w ? f(xi, yi) ? w ? f(x, y?) ? L(yi, y?)
where L(yi, y) is a measure of the loss of using y in-
stead of the correct labeling yi, and y? is a shorthand
for ywold(xi). In case of a single constraint, this pro-
gram has a closed-form solution. The most straight-
forward and the most commonly used loss function
is the Hamming loss, which sets the loss of labeling
y with respect to the gold labeling yi as the number
of training examples where the two labelings dis-
agree. Since Hamming loss is not flexible enough
for targeted training towards recall or precision, we
use a number of task-specific loss functions (see
Sections 3 and 5 for details). We implemented one-
best MIRA and the corresponding loss functions in
an in-house toolkit called Edlin. Edlin provides gen-
eral machine learning architecture for linear models
and a framework with implementations of popular
learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, percep-
tron, maximum entropy, one-best MIRA, and condi-
tional random fields (CRF) among others.
3 Trigger Word Tagging
The training and the development abstracts were
first tokenized and split into sentences using maxi-
mum entropy models trained on the Genia3 corpora.
Subsequently, we trained several sequence taggers
in order to identify the trigger words in text. All
our experiments used the standard BIO encoding
(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) with different feature
sets and learning procedures. We focused on recall
since it determines the upper bound on the perfor-
mance of our final system. In our experiments, we
found that simultaneously identifying trigger words
and the event types they trigger yielded low recall;
thus, we settled on identifying trigger words in text
as one kind of entity, regardless of event types.
In our initial experiments, we used a CRF-
based sequence tagger (Lafferty et al, 2001), which
yielded R=43.51%. We further tried feature induc-
tion (McCallum, 2003) and second-order Markov
assumptions for the CRF, achieving 44.72% and
49.64% recall, respectively.

dicts binary relations. Here e1 and e2 can be proteins
and/or trigger words.
Subsequently, we settled on using MIRA so that
we can trade-off precision for recall. In order to
boost recall, we defined the loss function as the num-
ber of false negative trigger chunks. Thus, a larger
loss update was made whenever the model failed to
discover a trigger word, while discovering spurious
trigger words was penalized less severely. We ex-
perimented with popular feature sets previously used
for named entity (McCallum and Li, 2003) and gene
(McDonald and Pereira, 2005) recognition including
orthographic, part-of-speech (POS), shallow parsing
and gazetteers. However, we found that only a small
number of them was really helpful; a summary is
presented in Table 1. In order to boost recall even
further, we prepared a gazetteer of trigger chunks
derived from the training data, and we extended it
with the corresponding WordNet synsets; we thus
achieved 80.44% recall for our final tagger.
4 Event Extraction
The input to our event extraction algorithm is a list
of trigger words and a list of genes or gene prod-
96
ucts (e.g., proteins); the output is a set of relations
as defined for Task 1. Our algorithm works in two
stages. First, we generate events corresponding to
relations between a trigger word and one or more
proteins (simple events); then we generate events for
relations between trigger words, proteins and simple
events (complex events). The two stages differ only
in the input data; thus, below we will describe our
system for the first stage only.
For each sentence, we considered all pairs of en-
tities (trigger words and proteins), and we used an
unstructured classifier to determine the relationship
for a given pair. These relationships encoded both
the type of event (e.g., binding, regulation) and enti-
ties? roles in that event (e.g., theme, cause); there
was also a special relationship for unrelated enti-
ties. We constructed labeled examples to train a
MIRA classifier using the training data provided by
the task organizers; n-ary relations were then recon-
structed from classifier?s predictions. The features
we used are summarized in Table 2: they are over
the words separating the two entities and their part-
of-speech tags. We further used some simple fea-
tures from syntactic phrases (OpenNLP4 parser) and
dependency parse trees (McDonald et al, 2005), ex-
tracted using parsers trained on Genia corpora.
After some initial experiments, we found that our
features were not sufficiently rich to allow us to learn
the relationships between proteins that are part of the
same event: we achieved a very low recall of about
20%. Consequently, we focused on the relationships
between a trigger word and a protein. Since the com-
petition stipulated that each trigger could be associ-
ated with only one type of event, we first chose the
event type for each trigger by selecting the protein-
label pair with the highest score. We then fixed the
event type for this trigger word, and we discarded all
proteins for which our classifier assigned a different
event type to the target trigger-protein pair. Finally,
we added to our output list all binary relations where
the role of the protein was theme.
For some event classes ? binding, regulation, pos-
itive regulation and negative regulation ? the output
of the binary classifier was further transformed so
that n-ary relations can be formed. However, the
way we did this was somewhat ad-hoc. For bind-

ing events, we added a 3-ary relation between the
trigger, the highest scoring protein, and the second
highest scoring protein. For regulation events, we
added a 3-ary relation between the trigger and every
pair of proteins where one was a theme and the other
one was a cause. This aggressive addition of poten-
tial matches slightly reduced the overall precision,
but helped improve the recall for the final system.
5 Results and Discussion
Unfortunately, we made an error when making our
official submission, which resulted in low scores;
Table 3 shows the results for that submission.
The rest of this section describes the results and
the implementation for the system we intended to
submit. All reported results are for exact span
matches and were obtained using the online tool pro-
vided by the task organizers.
As stated in Section 4, we used a linear model
trained using one-best MIRA with ten runs over
the data for the event extraction system. We over-
sampled the unstructured training instances that cor-
responded to a relation so that they become roughly
equal in number to those that do not correspond to a
relation. Finally, we performed parameter averaging
as described in (Freund and Schapire, 1999). These
details turned out to be very important for the system
performance.
Table 4 shows the results for three different loss
functions that gave the best results in our experi-
ments. In describing the loss functions, we define
three different types of errors: (1) if the system cor-
rectly predicted that a relation should be present,

but guessed the wrong type, we call this a cross-
labeling; (2) a false positive occurs when the learner
guessed some relation while there should have been
none; (3) the reverse is a false negative. All loss
functions we considered had a cross-labeling loss of
1. The 0-1 loss also has a loss of 1 for false positives
and false negatives. The high-recall loss function
penalizes false positives with 0.1 and false negatives
with 5. The high-precision loss function penalizes
false negatives with 0.1 and false positives with 5.
The values 0.1 and 5 were chosen on the develop-
ment data, but were not optimized aggressively.
In conclusion, we have built three domain-
independent event extraction systems based on the
MIRA framework, each using a different loss func-
tion. Overall, they perform quite well and would
have been ranked second on precision5, and 6th on
recall, and 7th on F1-measure.
6 Future Work
After integrating domain knowledge, which should
improve the recall for complex events and should
boost the overall precision, we intend to transform
the system output into RDF and add it to the PIKB
repository. The required efforts discouraged us from
building a middle ontology between the BioNLP and
the PIKB data models, especially given the time lim-
itations for the present task competition. However,
we believe this is a promising direction, which we
plan to pursue in future work.
5Our official submission is second on precision as well.

Abstract
We present experiments with part-of-
speech tagging for Bulgarian, a Slavic lan-
guage with rich inflectional and deriva-
tional morphology. Unlike most previous
work, which has used a small number of
grammatical categories, we work with 680
morpho-syntactic tags. We combine a large
morphological lexicon with prior linguis-
tic knowledge and guided learning from a
POS-annotated corpus, achieving accuracy
of 97.98%, which is a significant improve-
ment over the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian.
1 Introduction
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the task of as-
signing each of the words in a given piece of text a
contextually suitable grammatical category. This
is not trivial since words can play different syn-
tactic roles in different contexts, e.g., can is a
noun in ?I opened a can of coke.? but a verb in
?I can write.? Traditionally, linguists have classi-
fied English words into the following eight basic
POS categories: noun, pronoun, adjective, verb,
adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection;
this list is often extended a bit, e.g., with deter-
miners, particles, participles, etc., but the number
of categories considered is rarely more than 15.
Computational linguistics works with a larger
inventory of POS tags, e.g., the Penn Treebank
(Marcus et al 1993) uses 48 tags: 36 for part-
of-speech, and 12 for punctuation and currency
symbols. This increase in the number of tags
is partially due to finer granularity, e.g., there
are special tags for determiners, particles, modal
verbs, cardinal numbers, foreign words, existen-
tial there, etc., but also to the desire to encode
morphological information as part of the tags.
For example, there are six tags for verbs in the
Penn Treebank: VB (verb, base form; e.g., sing),
VBD (verb, past tense; e.g., sang), VBG (verb,
gerund or present participle; e.g., singing), VBN
(verb, past participle; e.g., sung) VBP (verb, non-
3rd person singular present; e.g., sing), and VBZ
(verb, 3rd person singular present; e.g., sings);
these tags are morpho-syntactic in nature. Other
corpora have used even larger tagsets, e.g., the
Brown corpus (Kuc?era and Francis, 1967) and the
Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus (Johansson
et al 1986) use 87 and 135 tags, respectively.
POS tagging poses major challenges for mor-
phologically complex languages, whose tagsets
encode a lot of additional morpho-syntactic fea-
tures (for most of the basic POS categories), e.g.,
gender, number, person, etc. For example, the
BulTreeBank (Simov et al 2004) for Bulgarian
uses 680 tags, while the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (Hajic?, 1998) for Czech has over 1,400 tags.
Below we present experiments with POS tag-
ging for Bulgarian, which is an inflectional lan-
guage with rich morphology. Unlike most previ-
ous work, which has used a reduced set of POS
tags, we use all 680 tags in the BulTreeBank. We
combine prior linguistic knowledge and statistical
learning, achieving accuracy comparable to that
reported for state-of-the-art systems for English.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 provides an overview of related
work, Section 3 describes Bulgarian morphology,
Section 4 introduces our approach, Section 5 de-
scribes the datasets, Section 6 presents our exper-
iments in detail, Section 7 discusses the results,
Section 8 offers application-specific error analy-
sis, and Section 9 concludes and points to some
promising directions for future work.

2 Related Work
Most research on part-of-speech tagging has fo-
cused on English, and has relied on the Penn Tree-
bank (Marcus et al 1993) and its tagset for train-
ing and evaluation. The task is typically addressed
as a sequential tagging problem; one notable ex-
ception is the work of Brill (1995), who proposed
non-sequential transformation-based learning.
A number of different sequential learning
frameworks have been tried, yielding 96-97%
accuracy: Lafferty et al(2001) experimented
with conditional random fields (CRFs) (95.7%
accuracy), Ratnaparkhi (1996) used a maximum
entropy sequence classifier (96.6% accuracy),
Brants (2000) employed a hidden Markov model
(96.6% accuracy), Collins (2002) adopted an av-
eraged perception discriminative sequence model
(97.1% accuracy). All these models fix the order
of inference from left to right.
Toutanova et al(2003) introduced a cyclic de-
pendency network (97.2% accuracy), where the
search is bi-directional. Shen et al(2007) have
further shown that better results (97.3% accu-
racy) can be obtained using guided learning, a
framework for bidirectional sequence classifica-
tion, which integrates token classification and in-
ference order selection into a single learning task
and uses a perceptron-like (Collins and Roark,
2004) passive-aggressive classifier to make the
easiest decisions first. Recently, Tsuruoka et al
(2011), proposed a simple perceptron-based clas-
sifier applied from left to right but augmented
with a lookahead mechanism that searches the
space of future actions, yielding 97.3% accuracy.
For morphologically complex languages, the
problem of POS tagging typically includes mor-
phological disambiguation, which yields a much
larger number of tags. For example, for Arabic,
Habash and Rambow (2005) used support vector
machines (SVM), achieving 97.6% accuracy with
139 tags from the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et
al., 2003). For Czech, Hajic? et al(2001) com-
bined a hidden Markov model (HMM) with lin-
guistic rules, which yielded 95.2% accuracy using
an inventory of over 1,400 tags from the Prague
Dependency Treebank (Hajic?, 1998). For Ice-
landic, Dredze and Wallenberg (2008) reported
92.1% accuracy with 639 tags developed for the
Icelandic frequency lexicon (Pind et al 1991),
they used guided learning and tag decomposition:
First, a coarse POS class is assigned (e.g., noun,
verb, adjective), then, additional fine-grained
morphological features like case, number and
gender are added, and finally, the proposed tags
are further reconsidered using non-local features.
Similarly, Smith et al(2005) decomposed the
complex tags into factors, where models for pre-
dicting part-of-speech, gender, number, case, and
lemma are estimated separately, and then com-
posed into a single CRF model; this yielded com-
petitive results for Arabic, Korean, and Czech.
Most previous work on Bulgarian POS tagging
has started with large tagsets, which were then
reduced. For example, Dojchinova and Mihov
(2004) mapped their initial tagset of 946 tags to
just 40, which allowed them to achieve 95.5%
accuracy using the transformation-based learning
of Brill (1995), and 98.4% accuracy using manu-
ally crafted linguistic rules. Similarly, Georgiev
et al(2009), who used maximum entropy and
the BulTreeBank (Simov et al 2004), grouped
its 680 fine-grained POS tags into 95 coarse-
grained ones, and thus improved their accuracy
from 90.34% to 94.4%. Simov and Osenova
(2001) used a recurrent neural network to predict
(a) 160 morpho-syntactic tags (92.9% accuracy)
and (b) 15 POS tags (95.2% accuracy).
Some researchers did not reduce the tagset:
Savkov et al(2011) used 680 tags (94.7% ac-
curacy), and Tanev and Mitkov (2002) used 303
tags and the BULMORPH morphological ana-
lyzer (Krushkov, 1997), achieving P=R=95%.
3 Bulgarian Morphology
Bulgarian is an Indo-European language from the
Slavic language group, written with the Cyrillic
alphabet and spoken by about 9-12 million peo-
ple. It is also a member of the Balkan Sprachbund
and thus differs frommost other Slavic languages:
it has no case declensions, uses a suffixed definite
article (which has a short and a long form for sin-
gular masculine), and lacks verb infinitive forms.
It further uses special evidential verb forms to ex-
press unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful activities.
Bulgarian is an inflective language with very
rich morphology. For example, Bulgarian verbs
have 52 synthetic wordforms on average, while
pronouns have altogether more than ten grammat-
ical features (not necessarily shared by all pro-
nouns), including case, gender, person, number,
definiteness, etc.
493
This rich morphology inevitably leads to ambi-
guity proliferation; our analysis of BulTreeBank
shows four major types of ambiguity:
1. Between the wordforms of the same lexeme,
i.e., in the paradigm. For example, divana,
an inflected form of divan (?sofa?, mascu-
line), can mean (a) ?the sofa? (definite, singu-
lar, short definite article) or (b) a count form,
e.g., as in dva divana (?two sofas?).
2. Between two or more lexemes, i.e., conver-
sion. For example, kato can be (a) a subor-
dinator meaning ?as, when?, or (b) a preposi-
tion meaning ?like, such as?.
3. Between a lexeme and an inflected wordform
of another lexeme, i.e., across-paradigms.
For example, politika can mean (a) ?the
politician? (masculine, singular, definite,
short definite article) or (b) ?politics? (fem-
inine, singular, indefinite).
4. Between the wordforms of two or more
lexemes, i.e., across-paradigms and quasi-
conversion. For example, vrvi can mean
(a) ?walks? (verb, 2nd or 3rd person, present
tense) or (b) ?strings, laces? (feminine, plu-
ral, indefinite).
Some morpho-syntactic ambiguities in Bulgar-
ian are occasional, but many are systematic, e.g.,
neuter singular adjectives have the same forms
as adverbs. Overall, most ambiguities are local,
and thus arguably resolvable using n-grams, e.g.,
compare hubavo dete (?beautiful child?), where
hubavo is a neuter adjective, and ?Pe hubavo.?
(?I sing beautifully.?), where it is an adverb of
manner. Other ambiguities, however, are non-
local and may require discourse-level analysis,
e.g., ?Vidh go.? can mean ?I saw him.?, where
go is a masculine pronoun, or ?I saw it.?, where
it is a neuter pronoun. Finally, there are ambi-
guities that are very hard or even impossible1 to
resolve, e.g., ?Deteto vleze veselo.? can mean
both ?The child came in happy.? (veselo is an ad-
jective) and ?The child came in happily.? (it is an
adverb); however, the latter is much more likely.
1The problem also exists for English, e.g., the annotators
of the Penn Treebank were allowed to use tag combinations
for inherently ambiguous cases: JJ|NN (adjective or noun as
prenominal modifier), JJ|VBG (adjective or gerund/present
participle), JJ|VBN (adjective or past participle), NN|VBG
(noun or gerund), and RB|RP (adverb or particle).
In many cases, strong domain preferences exist
about how various systematic ambiguities should
be resolved. We made a study for the newswire
domain, analyzing a corpus of 546,029 words,
and we found that ambiguity type 2 (lexeme-
lexeme) prevailed for functional parts-of-speech,
while the other types were more frequent for in-
flecting parts-of-speech. Below we show the most
frequent types of morpho-syntactic ambiguities
and their frequency in our corpus:
? na: preposition (?of?) vs. emphatic particle,
with a ratio of 28,554 to 38;
? da: auxiliary particle (?to?) vs. affirmative
particle, with a ratio of 12,035 to 543;
? e: 3rd person present auxiliary verb (?to be?)
vs. particle (?well?) vs. interjection (?wow?),
with a ratio of 9,136 to 21 to 5;
? singular masculine noun with a short definite
article vs. count form of a masculine noun,
with a ratio of 6,437 to 1,592;
? adverb vs. neuter singular adjective, with a
ratio of 3,858 to 1,753.
Overall, the following factors should be taken
into account when modeling Bulgarian morpho-
syntax: (1) locality vs. non-locality of grammat-
ical features, (2) interdependence of grammatical
features, and (3) domain-specific preferences.
4 Method
We used the guided learning framework described
in (Shen et al 2007), which has yielded state-of-
the-art results for English and has been success-
fully applied to other morphologically complex
languages such as Icelandic (Dredze and Wallen-
berg, 2008); we found it quite suitable for Bul-
garian as well. We used the feature set defined in
(Shen et al 2007), which includes the following:
1. The feature set of Ratnaparkhi (1996), in-
cluding prefix, suffix and lexical, as well as
some bigram and trigram context features;
2. Feature templates as in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996),
which have been shown helpful in bidirec-
tional search;
3. More bigram and trigram features and bi-
lexical features as in (Shen et al 2007).
Note that we allowed prefixes and suffixes of
length up to 9, as in (Toutanova et al 2003) and
(Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).
494
We further extended the set of features with
the tags proposed for the current word token by a
morphological lexicon, which maps words to pos-
sible tags; it is exhaustive, i.e., the correct tag is
always among the suggested ones for each token.
We also used 70 linguistically-motivated, high-
precision rules in order to further reduce the num-
ber of possible tags suggested by the lexicon.
The rules are similar to those proposed by Hin-
richs and Trushkina (2004) for German; we im-
plemented them as constraints in the CLaRK sys-
tem (Simov et al 2003).
Here is an example of a rule: If a wordform
is ambiguous between a masculine count noun
(Ncmt) and a singular short definite masculine
noun (Ncmsh), the Ncmt tag should be chosen if
the previous token is a numeral or a number.
The 70 rules were developed by linguists based
on observations over the training dataset only.
They target primarily the most frequent cases of
ambiguity, and to a lesser extent some infrequent
but very problematic cases. Some rules operate
over classes of words, while other refer to partic-
ular wordforms. The rules were designed to be
100% accurate on our training dataset; our exper-
iments show that they are also 100% accurate on
the test and on the development dataset.
Note that some of the rules are dependent on
others, and thus the order of their cascaded appli-
cation is important. For example, the wordform 
is ambiguous between an accusative feminine sin-
gular short form of a personal pronoun (?her?) and
an interjection (?wow?). To handle this properly,
the rule for interjection, which targets sentence
initial positions, followed by a comma, needs to
be executed first. The rule for personal pronouns
is only applied afterwards.

Table 1: Sample fragment showing the possible tags
suggested by the lexicon. The tags that are further
filtered by the rules are in italic; the correct tag is bold.
The rules are quite efficient at reducing the POS
ambiguity. On the test dataset, before the rule ap-
plication, 34.2% of the tokens (excluding punctu-
ation) had more than one tag in our morphological
lexicon. This number is reduced to 18.5% after
the cascaded application of the 70 linguistic rules.
Table 1 illustrates the effect of the rules on a small
sentence fragment. In this example, the rules have
left only one tag (the correct one) for three of the
ambiguous words. Since the rules in essence de-
crease the average number of tags per token, we
calculated that the lexicon suggests 1.6 tags per
token on average, and after the application of the
rules this number decreases to 1.44 per token.
5 Datasets
5.1 BulTreeBank
We used the latest version of the BulTree-
Bank (Simov and Osenova, 2004), which contains
20,556 sentences and 321,542 word tokens (four
times less than the English Penn Treebank), anno-
tated using a total of 680 unique morpho-syntactic
tags. See (Simov et al 2004) for a detailed de-
scription of the BulTreeBank tagset.
We split the data into training/development/test
as shown in Table 2. Note that only 552 of all 680
tag types were used in the training dataset, and
the development and the test datasets combined
contain a total of 128 new tag types that were not
seen in the training dataset. Moreover, 32% of the
word types in the development dataset and 31%
of those in the testing dataset do not occur in the
training dataset. Thus, data sparseness is an issue
at two levels: word-level and tag-level.

Table 2: Statistics about our datasets.
5.2 Morphological Lexicon
In order to alleviate the data sparseness issues,
we further used a large morphological lexicon for
Bulgarian, which is an extended version of the
dictionary described in (Popov et al 1998) and
(Popov et al 2003). It contains over 1.5M in-
flected wordforms (for 110K lemmata and 40K
proper names), each mapped to a set of possible
morpho-syntactic tags.

6 Experiments and Evaluation
State-of-the-art POS taggers for English typically
build a lexicon containing all tags a word type has
taken in the training dataset; this lexicon is then
used to limit the set of possible tags that an input
token can be assigned, i.e., it imposes a hard con-
straint on the possibilities explored by the POS
tagger. For example, if can has only been tagged
as a verb and as a noun in the training dataset,
it will be only assigned those two tags at test
time; other tags such as adjective, adverb and pro-
noun will not be considered. Out-of-vocabulary
words, i.e., those that were not seen in the train-
ing dataset, are constrained as well, e.g., to a small
set of frequent open-class tags.
In our experiments, we used a morphological
lexicon that is much larger than what could be
built from the training corpus only: building a
lexicon from the training corpus only is of lim-
ited utility since one can hardly expect to see in
the training corpus all 52 synthetic forms a verb
can possibly have. Moreover, we did not use the
tags listed in the lexicon as hard constraints (ex-
cept in one of our baselines); instead, we experi-
mented with a different, non-restrictive approach:
we used the lexicon?s predictions as features or
soft constraints, i.e., as suggestions only, thus al-
lowing each token to take any possible tag. Note
that for both known and out-of-vocabulary words
we used all 680 tags rather than the 552 tags ob-
served in the training dataset; we could afford to
explore this huge search space thanks to the effi-
ciency of the guided learning framework. Allow-
ing all 680 tags on training helped the model by
exposing it to a larger set of negative examples.
We combined these lexicon features with stan-
dard features extracted from the training corpus.
We further experimented with the 70 contextual
linguistic rules, using them (a) as soft and (b) as
hard constraints. Finally, we set four baselines:
three that do not use the lexicon and one that does.
Accuracy (%)
# Baselines (token-level)
1 MFT + unknowns are wrong 78.10
2 MFT + unknowns are Ncmsi 78.52
3 MFT + guesser for unknowns 79.49
4 MFT + lexicon tag-classes 94.40
Table 3: Most-frequent-tag (MFT) baselines.
6.1 Baselines
First, we experimented with the most-frequent-
tag baseline, which is standard for POS tagging.
This baseline ignores context altogether and as-
signs each word type the POS tag it was most
frequently seen with in the training dataset; ties
are broken randomly. We coped with word types
not seen in the training dataset using three sim-
ple strategies: (a) we considered them all wrong,
(b) we assigned them Ncmsi, which is the most
frequent open-class tag in the training dataset, or
(c) we used a very simple guesser, which assigned
Ncfsi, Ncnsi, Ncfsi, and Ncmsf, if the target word
ended by -a, -o, -i, and -t, respectively, other-
wise, it assigned Ncmsi. The results are shown
in lines 1-3 of Table 3: we can see that the token-
level accuracy ranges in 78-80% for (a)-(c), which
is relatively high, given that we use a large inven-
tory of 680 morpho-syntactic tags.
We further tried a baseline that uses the above-
described morphological lexicon, in addition to
the training dataset. We first built two frequency
lists, containing respectively (1) the most frequent
tag in the training dataset for each word type, as
before, and (2) the most frequent tag in the train-
ing dataset for each class of tags that can be as-
signed to some word type, according to the lexi-
con. For example, the most frequent tag for poli-
tika is Ncfsi, and the most frequent tag for the
tag-class {Ncmt;Ncmsi} is Ncmt.
Given a target word type, this new baseline first
tries to assign it the most frequent tag from the
first list. If this is not possible, which happens
(i) in case of ties or (ii) when the word type was
not seen on training, it extracts the tag-class from
the lexicon and consults the second list. If there
is a single most frequent tag in the corpus for this
tag-class, it is assigned; otherwise a random tag
from this tag-class is selected.
Line 4 of Table 3 shows that this latter baseline
achieves a very high accuracy of 94.40%. Note,
however, that this is over-optimistic: the lexicon
contains a tag-class for each word type in our test-
ing dataset, i.e., while there can be word types
not seen in the training dataset, there are no word
types that are not listed in the lexicon. Thus, this
high accuracy is probably due to a large extent
to the scale and quality of our morphological lexi-
con, and it might not be as strong with smaller lex-
icons; we plan to investigate this in future work.
496
6.2 Lexicon Tags as Soft Constraints
We experimented with three types of features:
1. Word-related features only;
2. Word-related features + the tags suggested
by the lexicon;
3. Word-related features + the tags suggested
by the lexicon but then further filtered using
the 70 contextual linguistic rules.
Table 4 shows the sentence-level and the token-
level accuracy on the test dataset for the three
kinds of features: shown on lines 1, 3 and 4, re-
spectively. We can see that using the tags pro-
posed by the lexicon as features (lines 3 and 4)
has a major positive impact, yielding up to 49%
error reduction at the token-level and up to 37%
at the sentence-level, as compared to using word-
related features alone (line 1).
Interestingly, filtering the tags proposed by the
lexicon using the 70 contextual linguistic rules
yields a minor decrease in accuracy both at the
word token-level and at the sentence-level (com-
pare line 4 to line 2). This is surprising since
the linguistic rules are extremely reliable: they
were designed to be 100% accurate on the train-
ing dataset, and we found them experimentally to
be 100% correct on the development and on the
testing dataset as well.
One possible explanation is that by limiting the
set of available tags for a given token at training
time, we prevent the model from observing some
potentially useful negative examples. We tested
this hypothesis by using the unfiltered lexicon
predictions at training time but then making use
of the filtered ones at testing time; the results are
shown on line 5. We can observe a small increase
in accuracy compared to line 4: from 97.80% to
97.84% at the token-level, and from 70.30% to
70.40% at the sentence-level. Although these dif-
ferences are tiny, they suggest that having more
negative examples at training is helpful.
We can conclude that using the lexicon as a
source of soft constraints has a major positive im-
pact, e.g., because it provides access to impor-
tant external knowledge that is complementary
to what can be learned from the training corpus
alone; the improvements when using linguistic
rules as soft constraints are more limited.
6.3 Linguistic Rules as Hard Constraints
Next, we experimented with using the suggestions
of the linguistic rules as hard constraints. Table 4
shows that this is a very good idea. Comparing
line 1 to line 2, which do not use the morpholog-
ical lexicon, we can see very significant improve-
ments: from 95.72% to 97.20% at the token-level
and from 52.95% to 64.50% at the sentence-level.
The improvements are smaller but still consistent
when the morphological lexicon is used: compar-
ing lines 3 and 4 to lines 6 and 7, respectively, we
see an improvement from 97.83% to 97.91% and
from 97.80% to 97.93% at the token-level, and
about 1% absolute at the sentence-level.
6.4 Increasing the Beam Size
Finally, we increased the beam size of guided
learning from 1 to 3 as in (Shen et al 2007).
Comparing line 7 to line 8 in Table 4, we can see
that this yields further token-level improvement:
from 97.93% to 97.98%.
7 Discussion
Table 5 compares our results to previously re-
ported evaluation results for Bulgarian. The
first four lines show the token-level accuracy for
standard POS tagging tools trained and evalu-
ated on the BulTreeBank:2 TreeTagger (Schmid,
1994), which uses decision trees, TnT (Brants,
2000), which uses a hidden Markov model,
SVMtool (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2004), which
is based on support vector machines, and
ACOPOST (Schro?der, 2002), implementing the
memory-based model of Daelemans et al(1996).
The following lines report the token-level accu-
racy reported in previous work, as compared to
our own experiments using guided learning.
We can see that we outperform by a very large
margin (92.53% vs. 97.98%, which represents
73% error reduction) the systems from the first
four lines, which are directly comparable to our
experiments: they are trained and evaluated on the
BulTreeBank using the full inventory of 680 tags.
We further achieved statistically significant im-
provement (p < 0.0001; Pearson?s chi-squared
test (Plackett, 1983)) over the best pervious result
on 680 tags: from 94.65% to 97.98%, which rep-
resents 62.24% error reduction at the token-level.
2We used the pre-trained TreeTagger; for the rest, we re-
port the accuracy given on the Webpage of the BulTreeBank:
www.bultreebank.org/taggers/taggers.html

Table 4: Evaluation results on the test dataset. Line 1 shows the evaluation results when using features derived
from the text corpus only; these features are used by all systems in the table. Line 2 further uses the contextual
linguistic rules to limit the set of possible POS tags that can be predicted. Note that these rules (1) consult the
lexicon, and (2) always predict a single POS tag. Line 3 uses the POS tags listed in the lexicon as features, i.e.,
as soft suggestions only. Line 4 is like line 3, but the list of feature-tags proposed by the lexicon is filtered by
the contextual linguistic rules. Line 5 is like line 4, but the linguistic rules filtering is only applied at test time;
it is not done on training. Lines 6 and 7 are similar to lines 3 and 4, respectively, but here the linguistic rules
are further applied to limit the set of possible POS tags that can be predicted, i.e., the rules are used as hard
constraints. Finally, line 8 is like line 7, but here the beam size is increased to 3.
Overall, we improved over almost all previ-
ously published results. Our accuracy is sec-
ond only to the manual rules approach of Do-
jchinova and Mihov (2004). Note, however, that
they used 40 tags only, i.e., their inventory is 17
times smaller than ours. Moreover, they have op-
timized their tagset specifically to achieve very
high POS tagging accuracy by choosing not to at-
tempt to resolve some inherently hard systematic
ambiguities, e.g., they do not try to choose be-
tween second and third person past singular verbs,
whose inflected forms are identical in Bulgarian
and hard to distinguish when the subject is not
present (Bulgarian is a pro-drop language).
In order to compare our results more closely
to the smaller tagsets in Table 5, we evaluated
our best model with respect to (a) the first letter
of the tag only (which is part-of-speech only, no
morphological information; 13 tags), e.g., Ncmsf
becomes N, and (b) the first two letters of the
tag (POS + limited morphological information;
49 tags), e.g., Ncmsf becomes Nc. This yielded
99.30% accuracy for (a) and 98.85% for (b).
The latter improves over (Dojchinova and Mihov,
2004), while using a bit larger number of tags.
Our best token-level accuracy of 97.98% is
comparable and even slightly better than the state-
of-the-art results for English: 97.33% when using
Penn Treebank data only (Shen et al 2007), and
97.50% for Penn Treebank plus some additional
unlabeled data (S?gaard, 2011). Of course, our
results are only indirectly comparable to English.
Still, our performance is impressive because
(1) our model is trained on 253,526 tokens only
while the standard training sections 0-18 of the
Penn Treebank contain a total of 912,344 tokens,
i.e., almost four times more, and (2) we predict
680 rather than just 48 tags as for the Penn Tree-
bank, which is 14 times more.
Note, however, that (1) we used a large exter-
nal morphological lexicon for Bulgarian, which
yielded about 50% error reduction (without it,
our accuracy was 95.72% only), and (2) our
train/dev/test sentences are generally shorter, and
thus arguably simpler for a POS tagger to analyze:
we have 17.4 words per test sentence in the Bul-
TreeBank vs. 23.7 in the Penn Treebank.
Our results also compare favorably to the state-
of-the-art results for other morphologically com-
plex languages that use large tagsets, e.g., 95.2%
for Czech with 1,400+ tags (Hajic? et al 2001),
92.1% for Icelandic with 639 tags (Dredze and
Wallenberg, 2008), 97.6% for Arabic with 139
tags (Habash and Rambow, 2005).
8 Error Analysis
In this section, we present error analysis with re-
spect to the impact of the POS tagger?s perfor-
mance on other processing steps in a natural lan-
guage processing pipeline, such as lemmatization
and syntactic dependency parsing.
First, we explore the most frequently confused
pairs of tags for our best-performing POS tagging
system; these are shown in Table 6.

Table 5: Comparison to previous work for Bulgarian. The first four lines report evaluation results for various
standard POS tagging tools, which were retrained and evaluated on the BulTreeBank. The following lines report
token-level accuracy for previously published work, as compared to our own experiments using guided learning.
We can see that most of the wrong tags share
the same part-of-speech (indicated by the initial
uppercase letter), such as V for verb, N for noun,
etc. This means that most errors refer to the mor-
phosyntactic features. For example, personal or
impersonal verb; definite or indefinite feminine
noun; singular or plural masculine adjective, etc.
At the same time, there are also cases, where the
error has to do with the part-of-speech label itself.
For example, between an adjective and an adverb,
or between a numeral and an indefinite pronoun.
We want to use the above tagger to develop
(1) a rule-based lemmatizer, using the morpholog-
ical lexicon, e.g., as in (Plisson et al 2004), and
(2) a dependency parser like MaltParser (Nivre et
al., 2007), trained on the dependency part of the
BulTreeBank. We thus study the potential impact
of wrong tags on the performance of these tools.
The lemmatizer relies on the lexicon and uses
string transformation functions defined via two
operations ? remove and concatenate:
if tag = Tag then
{remove OldEnd; concatenate NewEnd}
where Tag is the tag of the wordform, OldEnd is
the string that has to be removed from the end of
the wordform, and NewEnd is the string that has
to be concatenated to the beginning of the word-
form in order to produce the lemma.
Here is an example of such a rule:
if tag = Vpitf-o1s then
{remove oh; concatenate a}
The application of the above rule to the past
simple verb form qetoh (?I read?) would remove
oh, and then concatenate a. The result would be
the correct lemma qeta (?to read?).
Such rules are generated for each wordform in
the morphological lexicon; the above functional
representation allows for compact representation
in a finite state automaton. Similar rules are ap-
plied to the unknown words, where the lemma-
tizer tries to guess the correct lemma.
Obviously, the applicability of each rule cru-
cially depends on the output of the POS tagger.
If the tagger suggests the correct tag, then the
wordform would be lemmatized correctly. Note
that, in some cases of wrongly assigned POS tags
in a given context, we might still get the correct
lemma. This is possible in the majority of the
erroneous cases in which the part-of-speech has
been assigned correctly, but the wrong grammat-
ical alternative has been selected. In such cases,
the error does not influence lemmatization.
In order to calculate the proportion of such
cases, we divided each tag into two parts:
(a) grammatical features that are common for all
wordforms of a given lemma, and (b) features that
are specific to the wordform.

Table 6: Most frequently confused pairs of tags.
The part-of-speech features are always deter-
mined by the lemma. For example, Bulgarian
verbs have the lemma features aspect and tran-
sitivity. If they are correct, then the lemma is pre-
dicted also correctly, regardless of whether cor-
rect or wrong on the grammatical features. For
example, if the verb participle form (aorist or
imperfect) has its correct aspect and transitivity,
then it is lemmatized also correctly, regardless
of whether the imperfect or aorist features were
guessed correctly; similarly, for other error types.
We evaluated these cases for the 711 errors in our
experiment, and we found that 206 of them (about
29%) were non-problematic for lemmatization.
For the MaltParser, we encode most of the
grammatical features of the wordforms as spe-
cific features for the parser. Hence, it is much
harder to evaluate the problematic cases due to
the tagger. Still, we were able to make an es-
timation of some cases. Our strategy was to ig-
nore the grammatical features that do not always
contribute to the syntactic behavior of the word-
forms. Such grammatical features for the verbs
are aspect and tense. Thus, proposing perfective
instead of imperfective for a verb or present in-
stead of past tense would not cause problems for
the MaltParser. Among our 711 errors, 190 cases
(or about 27%) were not problematic for parsing.
Finally, we should note that there are two spe-
cial classes of tokens for which it is generally
hard to predict some of the grammatical features:
(1) abbreviations and (2) numerals written with
digits. In sentences, they participate in agreement
relations only if they are pronounced as whole
phrases; unfortunately, it is very hard for the tag-
ger to guess such relations since it does not have
at its disposal enough features, such as the inflec-
tion of the numeral form, that might help detect
and use the agreement pattern.
9 Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented experiments with part-of-
speech tagging for Bulgarian, a Slavic language
with rich inflectional and derivational morphol-
ogy. Unlike most previous work for this language,
which has limited the number of possible tags, we
used a very rich tagset of 680 morpho-syntactic
tags as defined in the BulTreeBank. By com-
bining a large morphological lexicon with prior
linguistic knowledge and guided learning from a
POS-annotated corpus, we achieved accuracy of
97.98%, which is a significant improvement over
the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian. Our token-level
accuracy is also comparable to the best results re-
ported for English.
In future work, we want to experiment with a
richer set of features, e.g., derived from unlabeled
data (S?gaard, 2011) or from the Web (Umansky-
Pesin et al 2010; Bansal and Klein, 2011). We
further plan to explore ways to decompose the
complex Bulgarian morpho-syntactic tags, e.g., as
proposed in (Simov and Osenova, 2001) and
(Smith et al 2005). Modeling long-distance
syntactic dependencies (Dredze and Wallenberg,
2008) is another promising direction; we believe
this can be implemented efficiently using poste-
rior regularization (Graca et al 2009) or expecta-
tion constraints (Bellare et al 2009).

Abstract
We describe the submission of the team
of the Sofia University to SemEval-2014
Task 9 on Sentiment Analysis in Twit-
ter. We participated in subtask B, where
the participating systems had to predict
whether a Twitter message expresses pos-
itive, negative, or neutral sentiment. We
trained an SVM classifier with a linear
kernel using a variety of features. We
used publicly available resources only, and
thus our results should be easily replicable.
Overall, our system is ranked 20th out of
50 submissions (by 44 teams) based on the
average of the three 2014 evaluation data
scores, with an F1-score of 63.62 on gen-
eral tweets, 48.37 on sarcastic tweets, and
68.24 on LiveJournal messages.
1 Introduction
We describe the submission of the team of the
Sofia University, Faculty of Mathematics and In-
formatics (SU-FMI) to SemEval-2014 Task 9 on
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Rosenthal et al.,
2014).

This SemEval challenge had two subtasks:
? subtask A (term-level) asks to predict the sen-
timent of a phrase inside a tweet;
? subtask B (message-level) asks to predict the
overall sentiment of a tweet message.
In both subtasks, the sentiment can be positive,
negative, or neutral. Here are some examples:
? positive: Gas by my house hit $3.39!!!! I?m
going to Chapel Hill on Sat. :)
? neutral: New York Giants: Game-by-Game
Predictions for the 2nd Half of the Season
http://t.co/yK9VTjcs
? negative: Why the hell does Selma have
school tomorrow but Parlier clovis & others
don?t?
? negative (sarcastic): @MetroNorth wall to
wall people on the platform at South Nor-
walk waiting for the 8:08. Thanks for the Sat.
Sched. Great sense
Below we first describe our preprocessing, fea-
tures and classifier in Section 2. Then, we discuss
our experiments, results and analysis in Section 3.
Finally, we conclude with possible directions for
future work in Section 4.
2 Method
Our approach is inspired by the highest scoring
team in 2013, NRC Canada (Mohammad et al.,
2013). We reused many of their resources.
1
Our system consists of two main submodules,
(i) feature extraction in the framework of GATE
(Cunningham et al., 2011), and (ii) machine learn-
ing using SVM with linear kernels as implemented
in LIBLINEAR
2
(Fan et al., 2008).

2.1 Preprocessing
We integrated a pipeline of various resources for
tweet analysis that are already available in GATE
(Bontcheva et al., 2013) such as a Twitter tok-
enizer, a sentence splitter, a hashtag tokenizer, a
Twitter POS tagger, a morphological analyzer, and
the Snowball
3
stemmer.
We further implemented in GATE some shal-
low text processing components in order to handle
negation contexts, emoticons, elongated words,
all-caps words and punctuation. We also added
components to find words and phrases contained
in sentiment lexicons, as well as to annotate words
with word cluster IDs using the lexicon built at
CMU,
4
which uses the Brown clusters (Brown et
al., 1992) as implemented
5
by (Liang, 2005).
2.2 Features
2.2.1 Sentiment lexicon features
We used several preexisting lexicons, both manu-
ally designed and automatically generated:
? Minqing Hu and Bing Liu opinion lexicon
(Hu and Liu, 2004): 4,783 positive and 2,006
negative terms;
? MPQA Subjectivity Cues Lexicon (Wilson et
al., 2005): 8,222 terms;
? Macquarie Semantic Orientation Lexicon
(MSOL) (Mohammad et al., 2009): 30,458
positive and 45,942 negative terms;
? NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad et al.,
2013): 14,181 terms with specified emotion.
For each lexicon, we find in the tweet the terms
that are listed in it, and then we calculate the fol-
lowing features:
? Negative terms count;
? Positive terms count;
? Positive negated terms count;
? Positive/negative terms count ratio;
? Sentiment of the last token;
? Overall sentiment terms count.

cluster_viewer.html
5
http://github.com/percyliang/
brown-cluster
We further used the following lexicons:
? NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon: list of
words and their associations with positive
and negative sentiment (Mohammad et al.,
2013): 54,129 unigrams, 316,531 bigrams,
480,010 pairs, and 78 high-quality positive
and negative hashtag terms;
? Sentiment140 Lexicon: list of words with as-
sociations to positive and negative sentiments
(Mohammad et al., 2013): 62,468 unigrams,
677,698 bigrams, 480,010 pairs;
? Stanford Sentiment Treebank: contains
239,231 evaluated words and phrases. If a
word or a phrase was found in the tweet, we
took the given sentiment label.
For the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and
the Sentiment140 Lexicon, we calculated the fol-
lowing features for unigrams, bigrams and pairs:
? Sum of positive terms? sentiment;
? Sum of negative terms? sentiment;
? Sum of the sentiment for all terms in the
tweet;
? Sum of negated positive terms? sentiment;
? Negative/positive terms ratio;
? Max positive sentiment;
? Min negative sentiment;
? Max sentiment of a term.
We used different features for the two lexicon
groups because their contents differ. The first four
lexicons provide a discrete sentiment value for
each word. In contrast, the following two lexicons
offer numeric sentiment scores, which allows for
different feature types such as sums and min/max
scores.
Finally, we manually built a new lexicon with
all emoticons we could find, where we assigned to
each emoticon a positive or a negative label. We
then calculated four features: number of positive
and negative emoticons in the tweet, and whether
the last token is a positive or a negative emoticon.
591
2.2.2 Tweet-level features
We use the following tweet-level features:
? All caps: the number of words with all char-
acters in upper case;
? Hashtags: the number ot hashtags in the
tweet;
? Elongated words: the number of words with
character repetitions.
2.2.3 Term-level features
We used the following term-level features:
? Word n-grams: presence or absence of 1-
grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, and 5-
grams. We add an NGRAM prefix to each n-
gram. Unfortunately, the n-grams increase
the feature space greatly and contribute to
higher sparseness. They also slow down
training dramatically. That is why our final
submission only includes 1-grams.
? Character n-grams: presence or absence of
one, two, three, four and five-character pre-
fixes and suffixes of all words. We add a PRE
or SUF prefix to each character n-gram.
? Negations: the number of negated contexts.
We define a negated context as a segment
of a tweet that starts with a negation word
(e.g., no, shouldnt) from our custom gazetteer
and ends with one of the punctuation marks:
,, ., :, ;, !, ?. A negated context affects the
n-gram and the lexicon features: we add a
NEG suffix to each word following the nega-
tion word, e.g., perfect becomes perfect NEG.
? Punctuation: the number of contiguous se-
quences of exclamation marks, of question
marks, of either exclamation or question
marks, and of both exclamation and question
marks. Also, whether the last token contains
an exclamation or a question mark (excluding
URLs).
? Stemmer: the stem of each word, excluding
URLs. We add a STEM prefix to each stem.
? Lemmatizer: the lemma of each word, ex-
cluding URLs. We add a LEMMA prefix to
each lemma. We use the built-in GATE Mor-
phological analyser as our lemmatizer.
? Word and word bigram clusters: word
clusters have been shown to improve the per-
formance of supervised NLP models (Turian
et al., 2010). We use the word clusters built
by CMU?s NLP toolkit, which were produced
over a collection of 56 million English tweets
(Owoputi et al., 2012) and built using the
Percy Liang?s HMM-based implementation
6
of Brown clustering (Liang, 2005; Brown et
al., 1992), which group the words into 1,000
hierarchical clusters. We use two features
based on these clusters:
? presence/absence of a word in a word
cluster;
? presence/absence of a bigram in a bi-
gram cluster.
? POS tagging: Social media are generally
hard to process using standard NLP tools,
which are typically developed with newswire
text in mind. Such standard tools are not
a good fit for Twitter messages, which are
too brief, contain typos and special word-
forms. Thus, we used a specialized POS
tagger, TwitIE, which is available in GATE
(Bontcheva et al., 2013), and which we in-
tegrated in our pipeline. It provides (i) a
tokenizer specifically trained to handle smi-
lies, user names, URLs, etc., (ii) a normal-
izer to correct slang and misspellings, and
(iii) a POS tagger that uses the Penn Treebank
tagset, but is optimized for tweets. Using the
TwitIE toolkit, we performed POS tagging
and we extracted all POS tag types that we
can find in the tweet together with their fre-
quencies as features.
2.3 Classifier
For classification, we used the above features and
a support vector machine (SVM) classifier as im-
plemented in LIBLINEAR. This is a very scal-
able implementation of SVM that does not support
kernels, and is suitable for classification on large
datasets with a large number of features. This is
particularly useful for text classification, where the
number of features is very large, which means that
the data is likely to be linearly separable, and thus
using kernels is not really necessary. We scaled the
SVM input and we used L2-regularization during
training.

3 Experiments, Results, Analysis
3.1 Experimental setup
At development time, we trained on train-2013,
tuned the C value of SVM on dev-2013, and eval-
uated on test-2013 (Nakov et al., 2013). For our
submission, we trained on train-2013+dev-2013,
and we evaluated on the 2014 test dataset pro-
vided by the organizers. This dataset contains two
parts and a total of five datasets: (a) progress test
(the Twitter and SMS test datasets for 2013), and
(b) new test datasets (from Twitter, from Twitter
with sarcasm, and from LiveJournal). We used
C=0.012, which was best on development.
3.2 Official results
Due to our very late entering in the competition,
we have only managed to perform a small num-
ber of experiments, and we only participated in
subtask B. We were ranked 20th out of 50 sub-
missions; our official results are shown in Table 1.
The numbers after our score are the delta to the
best solution. We have also included a ranking
among 2014 participant systems on the 2013 data
sets, released by the organizers.

sarcasm2014 48.34 (9.82) 19
LiveJournal2014 68.23 (6.60) 21
tweets2013 60.96 (9.79) 29
SMS2013 61.67 (8.61) 16
2014 mean 60.07 (7.55) 20
Table 1: Our submitted system for subtask B.
3.3 Analysis
Tables 2 and 3 analyze the impact of the individual
features. They show the F1-scores and the loss
when a feature or a group of features is removed;
we show the impact on all test datasets, both from
2013 and from 2014. The exception here is the all
+ ngrams row, which contains our scores if we had
used the n-grams feature group.
The features are sorted by their impact on
the Twitter2014 test set. We can see that the
three most important feature groups are POS tags,
word/bigram clusters, and lexicons.
We can further see that although the overall lex-
icon feature group is beneficial, some of the lex-
icons actually hurt the 2014 score and we would
have been better off without them.
These are the Sentiment140 lexicon, the Stan-
ford Sentiment Treebank and the NRC Emotion
lexicon. The highest gain we get is from the lex-
icons of Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. It must be
noted that using lexicons with good results ap-
parently depends on the context, e.g., the Senti-
ment140 lexicon seems to be helping a lot with
the LiveJournal test dataset, but it hurts the Sar-
casm score by a sizeable margin.
Another interesting observation is that even
though including the n-gram feature group is per-
forming notably better on the Twitter2013 test
dataset, it actually worsens performance on all
2014 test sets. Had we included it in our results,
we would have scored lower.
The negation context feature brings little in re-
gards to regular tweets or LiveJournal text, but it
heavily improves our score on the Sarcasm tweets.
It is unclear why our results differ so much from
those of the NRC-Canada team in 2013 since our
features are quite similar. We attribute the differ-
ence to the fact that some of the lexicons we use
actually hurt our score as we mentioned above.
Another difference could be that last year?s NRC
system uses n-grams, which we have disabled as
they lowered our scores. Last but not least, there
could be bugs lurking in our feature representation
that additionally lower our results.
3.4 Post-submission improvements
First, we did more extensive experiments to val-
idate our classifier?s C value. We found that the
best value for C is actually 0.08 instead of our
original proposal 0.012.
Then, we experimented further with our lexi-
con features and we removed the following ones,
which resulted in significant improvement over
our submitted version:
? Sentiment of the last token for NRC Emotion,
MSOL, MPQA, and Bing Liu lexicons;
? Max term positive, negative and sentiment
scores for unigrams of Sentiment140 and
NRC Sentiment lexicons;
? Max term positive, negative and sentiment
scores for bigrams of Sentiment140 and NRC
Sentiment lexicons;
? Max term positive, negative and sentiment
scores for hashtags of Sentiment140 and
NRC Sentiment lexicons.

4 Conclusion and Future Work
We have described the system built by the team of
SU-FMI for SemEval-2014 task 9. Due to our late
entering in the competition, we were only ranked
20th out of 50 submissions (from 44 teams).
We have made some interesting observations
about the impact of the different features. Among
the best-performing feature groups were POS-tag
counts, word cluster presence and bigrams, the
Hu-Liu lexicon and the NRC Hashtag Sentiment
lexicon. These had the most sustainable perfor-
mance over the 2013 and the 2014 test datasets.
Others we did not use, seemingly more context
dependent, seem to have been more suited for the
2013 test sets like the n-grams feature group.
Even though we made some improvements af-
ter submitting our initial version, we feel there is
more to gain and optimize. There seem to be sev-
eral low-hanging fruits based on our experiments
data, which could add few points to our F1-scores.
Going forward, our goal is to extend our experi-
ments with more feature sub- and super-sets and to
turn our classifier into a state-of-the-art performer.
