Abstract
We present a city navigation and tourist
information mobile dialogue app with in-
tegrated question-answering (QA) and ge-
ographic information system (GIS) mod-
ules that helps pedestrian users to nav-
igate in and learn about urban environ-
ments. In contrast to existing mobile apps
which treat these problems independently,
our Android app addresses the prob-
lem of navigation and touristic question-
answering in an integrated fashion using
a shared dialogue context. We evaluated
our system in comparison with Samsung
S-Voice (which interfaces to Google nav-
igation and Google search) with 17 users
and found that users judged our system to
be significantly more interesting to inter-
act with and learn from. They also rated
our system above Google search (with the
Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist in-
formation tasks.
1 Introduction
We present a mobile dialogue system (an Android
app) called Spacebook that addresses the problem
of pedestrian navigation and tourist information in
urban environments. There has been little prior
work that addresses these two problems - naviga-
tion and tourist information provision - in an inte-
grated way. By navigation, we refer to the prob-
lem of finding appropriate destinations to go to
and the task of wayfinding to reach them and by
tourist information provision we refer to the prob-
lem of meeting the informational needs of a user
about entities such as museums, statues and fa-
mous personalities. A dialogue system such as this
could serve as a personal tour guide to pedestrian
tourists as they walk around unknown cities. With
the proliferation of smartphones, there has been a
number of mobile apps developed to address these
problems. However these apps have the following
problems: first, they demand the user?s visual at-
tention because they predominantly present infor-
mation on a mobile screen. This can be dangerous
in urban environments, as well as being distract-
ing. Second, these apps address the problems of
navigation and tourist information independently
and therefore do not have a shared interaction con-
text. This means that users cannot switch between
information and navigation tasks in a natural and
fluid manner.

Table 1: An example interaction with the evalu-
ated system
In contrast to many existing mobile apps,
Spacebook has a speech-only interface and ad-
dresses both problems in an integrated way. We
conjecture that with a speech-only interface, users
can immerse themselves in exploring the city,
and that because of the shared context they can
switch between navigation and tourist information
tasks more easily. Using the navigational context,
Spacebook pushes point-of-interest information
which can then initiate tourist information tasks
using the QA module. Table 1 presents an example
interaction with our system showing the integrated
use of navigation and question-answering capabil-
1660
ities. Utterances System4-8 show the system?s ca-
pability to push information about nearby points-
of-interest (PoI) during a navigation task and an-
swer followup questions using the QA system (in
utterances User2 and User3). The final 3 utter-
ances show a natural switch between navigation to
an entity and QA about that entity.
We investigate whether our system using a com-
bination of geographical information system (GIS)
and natural language processing (NLP) technolo-
gies would be a better companion to pedestrian
city explorers than the current state-of-the-art mo-
bile apps. We hypothesize that, (1) users will find
our speech-only interface to navigation efficient as
it allows them to navigate without having to re-
peatedly look at a map and (2), that users will
find a dialogue interface which integrates touris-
tic question-answering and navigation within a
shared context to be useful for finding information
about entities in the urban environment. We first
present some related work in section 2. We de-
scribe the architecture of the system in section 3.
We then present our experimental design, results
and analysis in sections 5, 6 and 7.
2 Related work
Mobile apps such as Siri, Google Maps Naviga-
tion, Sygic, etc. address the problem of naviga-
tion while apps like Triposo, Guidepal, Wikihood,
etc. address the problem of tourist information by
presenting the user with descriptive information
about various points of interest (PoI) in the city.
While some exploratory apps present snippets of
information about a precompiled list of PoIs, other
apps dynamically generate a list of PoIs arranged
based on their proximity to the users. Users can
also obtain specific information about PoIs using
Search apps. Also, since these navigation and ex-
ploratory/search apps do not address both prob-
lems in an integrated way, users need to switch
between them and therefore lose interaction con-
text.
While most apps address these two problems
independently, some like Google Now, Google
Field Trip, etc, mix navigation with exploration.
But such apps present information primarily vi-
sually on the screen for the user to read. Some
of these are available for download at the Google
Play Android app store1. Several dialogue and
natural language systems have addressed the issue
1https://play.google.com/store
of pedestrian navigation (Malaka and Zipf, 2000;
Raubal and Winter, 2002; Dale et al, 2003; Bar-
tie and Mackaness, 2006; Shroder et al, 2011;
Dethlefs and Cuaya?huitl, 2011). There has also
been recent interest in shared tasks for generat-
ing navigation instructions in indoor and urban en-
vironments (Byron et al, 2007; Janarthanam and
Lemon, 2011). Some dialogue systems deal with
presenting information concerning points of inter-
est (Ko et al, 2005; Kashioka et al, 2011) and in-
teractive question answering (Webb and Webber,
2009).
In contrast, Spacebook has the objective of
keeping the user?s cognitive load low and prevent-
ing users from being distracted (perhaps danger-
ously so) from walking in the city (Kray et al,
2003). Also, it allows users to interleave the two
sub-tasks seamlessly and can keep entities dis-
cussed in both tasks in shared context (as shown
in Table 1).
3 Architecture
The architecture of the Spacebook system is
shown in figure 1. Our architecture brings to-
gether Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), Geo-
graphic Information Systems (GIS) and Question-
Answering (QA) technologies (Janarthanam et al,
2012). Its essentially a spoken dialogue system
(SDS) consisting of an automatic speech recog-
niser (ASR), a semantic parser, an Interaction
Manager, an utterance generator and a text-to-
speech synthesizer (TTS). The GIS modules in
this architecture are the City Model, the Visibility
Engine, and the Pedestrian tracker. Users commu-
nicate with the system using a smartphone-based
client app (an Android app) that sends users? po-
sition, pace rate, and spoken utterances to the sys-
tem, and delivers synthesised system utterances to
the user.
Figure 1: System Architecture
1661
3.1 Dialogue interface
The dialogue interface consists of a speech recog-
nition module, an utterance parser, an interaction
manager, an utterance generator and a speech syn-
thesizer. The Nuance 9 speech recogniser with
a domain specific language model was used for
speech recognition. The recognised speech is cur-
rently parsed using a rule-based parser into dia-
logue acts and semantic content.
The Interaction Manager (IM) is the central
component of this architecture, which provides
the user with navigational instructions, pushes PoI
information and manages QA questions. It re-
ceives the user?s input in the form of a dialogue
act (DA), the user?s location (latitude and longi-
tude) and pace rate. Based on these inputs and the
dialogue context, it responds with system output
dialogue act, based on a dialogue policy. The IM
initiates the conversation with a calibration phase
where the user?s initial location and orientation are
obtained. The user can then initiate tasks that in-
terest him/her. These tasks include searching for
an entity (e.g. a museum or a restaurant), request-
ing navigation instructions to a destination, ask-
ing questions about the entities in the City Model,
and so on. When the user is mobile, the IM iden-
tifies points of interest2 on the route proximal to
the user. We call this ?PoI push?. The user is en-
couraged to ask for more information if he/she is
interested. The system also answers adhoc ques-
tions from the user (e.g. ?Who is David Hume??,
?What is the Old College??, etc) (see section 3.4).
Navigation instructions are given in-situ by ob-
serving user?s position continuously, in relation
to the next node (street junction) on the current
planned route, and they are given priority if in con-
flict with a PoI push at the same time. Navigation
instructions use landmarks near route nodes when-
ever possible (e.g. ?When you reach Clydesdale
Bank , keep walking forward?). The IM also in-
forms when users pass by recognisable landmarks,
just to reassure them that they are on track (e.g.
?You will pass by Tesco on the right?). In addition
to navigation instructions, the IM also answers
users? questions concerning the route, his/her lo-
cation, and location of and distance to the various
entities. Finally, the IM uses the city model?s Vis-
ibility Engine (VE) to determine whether the des-
tination is visible to the user (see section 3.3).
2Using high scoring ones when there are many, based on
tourist popularity ratings in the City Model.
The shared spatial and dialogue context em-
ploys a feature-based representation which is up-
dated every 1 second (for location), and after every
dialogue turn. Spatial context such as the user?s
coordinates, street names, PoIs and landmarks
proximal to the user, etc are used by PoI push-
ing and navigation. The dialogue context main-
tains the history of landmarks and PoIs pushed,
latest entities mentioned, etc to resolve anaphoric
references in navigation and QA requests, and to
deliver coherent dialogue responses. The IM re-
solves anaphoric references by keeping a record
of entities mentioned in the dialogue context. It
also engages in clarification sub-dialogues when
the speech recognition confidence scores are low.
The IM stores the name and type information for
each entity (such as landmark, building, etc) men-
tioned in navigation instructions and PoI pushes.
Subsequent references to these entities using ex-
pressions such as ?the museum?, ?the cafe? etc
are resolved by searching for the latest entity of
the given type. Pronouns are resolved to the last
mentioned entity.
The IM also switches between navigation, PoI
push, and QA tasks in an intelligent manner by
using the shared context to prioritise its utterances
from these different tasks. The utterance genera-
tor is a Natural Language Generation module that
translates the system DA into surface text which is
converted into speech using the Cereproc Text-to-
Speech Synthesizer using a Scottish female voice.
The only changes made were minor adjustments
to the pronunciation of certain place names.
3.2 Pedestrian tracker
Urban environments can be challenging with lim-
ited sky views, and hence limited line of sight
to satellites, in deep urban corridors. There is
therefore significant uncertainty about the user?s
true location reported by GNSS sensors on smart-
phones (Zandbergen and Barbeau, 2011). This
module improves on the reported user position
by combining smartphone sensor data (e.g. ac-
celerometer) with map matching techniques, to
determine the most likely location of the pedes-
trian (Bartie and Mackaness, 2012).
3.3 City Model
The City Model is a spatial database containing
information about thousands of entities in the city
of Edinburgh (Bartie and Mackaness, 2013). This
data has been collected from a variety of exist-
1662
ing resources such as Ordnance Survey, Open-
StreetMap, Google Places, and the Gazetteer for
Scotland. It includes the location, use class, name,
street address, and where relevant other properties
such as build date and tourist ratings. The model
also includes a pedestrian network (streets, pave-
ments, tracks, steps, open spaces) which is used
by an embedded route planner to calculate min-
imal cost routes, such as the shortest path. The
city model also consists of a Visibility Engine
that identifies the entities that are in the user?s
vista space (Montello, 1993). To do this it ac-
cesses a digital surface model, sourced from Li-
DAR, which is a 2.5D representation of the city
including buildings, vegetation, and land surface
elevation. The Visibility Engine uses this dataset
to offer a number of services, such as determining
the line of sight from the observer to nominated
points (e.g. which junctions are visible), and de-
termining which entities within the city model are
visible. Using these services, the IM determines if
the destination is visible or not.
3.4 Question-Answering server
The QA server currently answers a range of def-
inition and biographical questions such as, ?Tell
me more about the Scottish Parliament?, ?Who
was David Hume??, ?What is haggis??, and re-
quests to resume (eg. ?Tell me more?). QA
is also capable of recognizing out of scope re-
quests, that is, either navigation-related questions
that can be answered by computations from the
City Model and dealt with elsewhere in the sys-
tem (?How far away is the Scottish Parliament??,
?How do I get there??), or exploration queries
that cannot be handled yet (?When is the can-
non gun fired from the castle??). Question clas-
sification is entirely machine learning-based using
the SMO algorithm (Keerthi et al, 1999) trained
over 2013 annotated utterances. Once the question
has been typed, QA proceeds to focus detection
also using machine learning techniques (Mikhail-
sian et al, 2009). Detected foci include possi-
bly anaphoric expressions (?Who was he??, ?Tell
me more about the castle?). These expressions
are resolved against the dialogue history and ge-
ographical context. QA then proceeds to a tex-
tual search on texts from the Gazetteer of Scotland
(Gittings, 2012) and Wikipedia, and definitions
from WordNet glosses. The task is similar to TAC
KBP 2013 Entity Linking Track and named en-
tity disambiguation (Cucerzan, 2007). Candidate
answers are reranked using a trained confidence
score with the top candidate used as the final an-
swer. These are usually long, descriptive answers
and are provided as a flow of sentence chunks that
the user can interrupt (see table 2). The Interaction
Manager queries the QA model and pushes infor-
mation when a salient PoI is in the vicinity of the
user.
?Edinburgh?s most famous and historic thoroughfare,
which has formed the heart of the Old Town since
mediaeval times. The Royal Mile includes Castlehill,
the Lawnmarket, the Canongate and the Abbey Strand,
but, is officially known simply as the High Street.?
Table 2: QA output: query on ?Royal Mile?
3.5 Mobile client
The mobile client app, installed on an Android
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S3), connects the
user to the dialogue system using a 3G data con-
nection. The client senses the user?s location us-
ing positioning technology using GNSS satellites
(GPS and GLONASS) which is sent to the dia-
logue system at the rate of one update every two
seconds. It also sends pace rate of the user from
the accelerometer sensor. In parallel, the client
also places a phone call using which the user com-
municates with the dialogue system.
4 Baseline system
The baseline system chosen for evaluation was
Samsung S-Voice, a state-of-the-art commercial
smartphone speech interface. S-Voice is a Sam-
sung Android mobile phone app that allows a user
to use the functionalities of device using a speech
interface. For example, the user can say ?Call
John? and it will dial John from the user?s con-
tacts. It launches the Google Navigation app when
users request directions and it activates Google
Search for open ended touristic information ques-
tions. The Navigation app is capable of providing
instructions in-situ using speech. We used the S-
Voice system for comparison because it provided
an integrated state-of-the-art interface to use both
a navigation app and also an information-seeking
app using the same speech interface. Users were
encouraged to use these apps using speech but
were allowed to use the GUI interface when us-
ing speech wasn?t working (e.g. misrecognition of
local names). Users obtained the same kind of in-
1663
formation (i.e. navigation directions, descriptions
about entities such as people, places, etc) from the
baseline system as they would from our system.
However, our system interacted with the user us-
ing the speech modality only.
5 Experimental design
Spacebook and the baseline were evaluated in the
summer of 2012. We evaluated both systems with
17 subjects in the streets of Edinburgh. There
were 11 young subjects (between 20 and 26 years,
mean=22 ? 2) and 6 older subjects (between 50
and 71 years, mean=61 ? 11). They were mostly
native English speakers (88%). 59% of the users
were regular smartphone users and their mean
overall time spent in the city was 76 months. The
test subjects had no previous experience with the
proposed system. They were recruited via email
adverts and mail shots. Subjects were given a task
sheet with 8 tasks in two legs (4 tasks per leg).
These tasks included both navigation and tourist
information tasks (see table 3). Subjects used our
system for one of the legs and the baseline system
for the other and the order was balanced. Each leg
took up to 30 mins to finish and the total duration
including questionnaires was about 1.5 hours. Fig-
ure 2 shows the route taken by the subjects. The
route is about 1.3 miles long. Subjects were fol-
lowed by the evaluator who made notes on their
behaviour (e.g. subject looks confused, subject
looks at or manipulates the phone, subject looks
around, etc).
Subjects filled in a demographic questionnaire
prior to the experiment. After each leg, they filled
in a system questionnaire (see appendix) rating
their experience. After the end of the experi-
ment, they filled out a comparative questionnaire
and were debriefed. They were optionally asked
to elaborate on their questionnaire ratings. Users
were paid ?20 after the experiment was over.
6 Results
Subjects were asked to identify tasks that they
thought were successfully completed. The per-
ceived task success rates of the two systems were
compared for each task using the Chi square test.
The results show that there is no statistically sig-
nificant difference between the two systems in
terms of perceived task success although the base-
line system had a better task completion rate in
tasks 1-3, 5 and 6. Our system performed better in
Figure 2: Task route
tourist information tasks (4, 7) (see table 4).

formation task)
The system questionnaires that were filled out
by users after each leg were analysed. These
consisted of questions concerning each system to
be rated on a six point Likert scale (1-Strongly
Disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-Somewhat Disagree, 4-
Somewhat Agree, 5-Agree, 6-Strongly Agree).
The responses were paired and tested using a
Wilcoxon Sign Rank test. Median and Mode for
each system and significance in differences are
shown in table 5. Results show that although
our system is not performing significantly better
than the baseline system (SQ1-SQ10 except SQ7),
users seem to find it more understanding (SQ7)
and more interesting to interact with (SQ11) than
the baseline. We grouped the subjects by age
group and tested their responses. We found that
the young subjects (age group 20-26), also felt that

(SQ12) (p < 0.05) while the elderly (age group
50-71) didn?t. We also found statistically signifi-
cant differences in smartphone users rating for our
system on their learning compared to the baseline
(SQ12).
Subjects were also asked to choose between the
two systems given a number of requirements such
as ease of use, use for navigation, tourist infor-
mation, etc. There was an option to rank the sys-
tems equally (i.e. a tie). They were presented with
the same requirements as the system questionnaire
with one additional question - ?Overall which sys-
tem do you prefer?? (CQ0). Users? choice of sys-
tem based on a variety of requirements is shown
in table 6. Users? choice counts were tested us-
ing Chi-square test. Significant differences were
found in users? choice of system for navigation
and tourist information requirements. Users pre-
ferred the baseline system for navigation (CQ2)
and our system for touristic information (CQ3) on
the city. Although there was a clear choice of sys-
tems based on the two tasks, there was no signifi-
cant preference of one system over the other over-
all (CQ0). They chose our system as the most in-
teresting system to interact with (CQ11) and that
it was more informative than the baseline (CQ12).
Figure 3 shows the relative frequency between
user choices on comparative questions.
7 Analysis
Users found it somewhat difficult to navigate using
Spacebook (see comments in table 7). Although
the perceived task success shows that our system
was able to get the users to their destination and
there was no significant difference between the
two systems based on their questionnaire response
on navigation, they pointed out a number of issues
and suggested a number of modifications. Many
Figure 3: Responses to comparative questions
users noted that a visual map and the directional
arrow in the baseline system was helpful for nav-
igation. In addition, they noted that our system?s
navigation instructions were sometimes not satis-
factory. They observed that there weren?t enough
instructions coming from the system at street junc-
tions. They needed more confirmatory utterances
(that they are walking in the right direction) (5
users) and quicker recovery and notification when
walking the wrong way (5 users). They observed
that the use of street names was confusing some-
times. Some users also wanted a route summary
before the navigation instructions are given.
The problem with Spacebook?s navigation pol-
icy was that it did not, for example, direct the
user via easily visible landmarks (e.g. ?Head to-
wards the Castle?), and relies too much on street
names. Also, due to the latency in receiving GPS
information, the IM sometimes did not present in-
structions soon enough during evaluation. Some-
times it received erroneous GPS information and
therefore got the user?s orientation wrong. These
problems will be addressed in the future version.
Some users did find navigation instructions use-
ful because of the use of proximal landmarks such

Table 6: User?s choice on comparative questions
(CQ are the same questions as SQ but requesting
a ranking of the 2 systems)
as KFC, Tesco, etc. (popular chain stores). Some
users also suggested that our system should have
a map and that routes taken should be plotted on
them for reference. Based on the ratings and ob-
servations made by the users, we conclude that our
first hypothesis that Spacebook would be more ef-
ficient for navigation than the baseline because of
its speech-only interface was inconclusive. We be-
lieve so because users? poor ratings for Spacebook
may be due to the current choice of dialogue pol-
icy for navigation. It may be possible to reassure
the user with a better dialogue policy with just the
speech interface. However, this needs further in-
vestigation.
Users found the information-search task inter-
esting and informative when they used Spacebook
(see sample user comments in table 8). They
also found push information on nearby PoIs un-
expected and interesting as they would not have
found them otherwise. Many users believed that
this could be an interesting feature that could help
tourists. They also found that asking questions and
finding answers was much easier with Spacebook
compared to the baseline system, where some-
times users needed to type search keywords in.
Another user observation was that they did not
have to stop to listen to information presented
by our system (as it was in speech) and could
carry on walking. However, with the baseline sys-
tem, they had to stop to read information off the
screen. Although users in general liked the QA
feature, many complained that Spacebook spoke
too quickly when it was presenting answers. Some
users felt that the system might lose context of the
navigation task if presented with a PoI question.
In contrast, some others noted Spacebook?s ability
to interleave the two tasks and found it to be an
advantage.
Users? enthusiasm for our system was observed
when (apart from the points of interest that were
in the experimental task list) they also asked spon-
taneous questions about James Watt, the Talbot
Rice gallery, the Scottish Parliament and Edin-
burgh Castle. Some of the PoIs that the system
pushed information about were the Royal College
of Surgeons, the Flodden Wall, the Museum of
Childhood, and the Scottish Storytelling Centre.
Our system answered a mean of 2.5 out of 6.55
questions asked by users in leg 1 and 4.88 out of
8.5 questions in leg 2. Please note that an utter-
ance is sent to QA if it is not parsed by the parser
and therefore some utterances may not be legit-
mate questions themselves. Users were pushed a
mean of 2.88 and 6.37 PoIs during legs 1 and 2.
There were a total of 17 ?tell me more? requests
requesting the system to present more information
(mean=1.35 ? 1.57).
Evaluators who followed the subjects noted that
the subjects felt difficulty using the baseline sys-
tem as they sometimes struggled to see the screen
1666
1. ?It?s useful when it says ?Keep walking? but it should say it more often.?
2. ?[Your system] not having a map, it was sometimes difficult to check how aware it was of my environment.?
3. ?[Google] seemed to be easier to follow as you have a map as well to help.?
4. ?It told me I had the bank and Kentucky Fried Chicken so I crossed the road because I knew it?d be somewhere over
beside them. I thought ?OK, great. I?m going the right way.? but then it didn?t say anything else. I like those kind of
directions because when it said to go down Nicolson Street I was looking around trying to find a street sign.?
5. ?The system keeps saying ?when we come to a junction, I will tell you where to go?, but I passed junctions and it
didn?t say anything. It should say ?when you need to change direction, I will tell you.??
6. ?I had to stop most of the times for the system to be aware of my position. If walking very slowly, its awareness of
both landmarks and streets is excellent.?
Table 7: Sample user comments on the navigation task
1. ?Google doesn?t *offer* any information. I would have to know what to ask for...?
2. ?Since many information is given without being asked for (by your system), one can discover new places and
landmarks even if he lives in the city. Great feature!!?
3. ?I didn?t feel confident to ask [your system] a question and still feel it would remember my directions?
4. ?Google could only do one thing at a time, you couldn?t find directions for a place whilst learning more.?
5. ?If she talked a little bit slower [I would use the system for touristic purposes]. She just throws masses of information
really, really quickly.?
Table 8: Sample user comments on the tourist information task
in bright sunlight. They sometimes had difficulty
identifying which way to go based on the route
plotted on the map. In comparison, subjects did
not have to look at the screen when they used
our system. Based on the ratings and observa-
tions made by the users about our system?s tourist
information features such as answering questions
and pushing PoI information, we have support for
our second hypothesis: that users find a dialogue
interface which integrates question-answering and
navigation within a shared context to be useful for
finding information about entities in the urban en-
vironment.
8 Future plans
We plan to extend Spacebook?s capabilities to ad-
dress other challenges in pedestrian navigation and
tourist information. Many studies have shown
that visible landmarks provide better cues for nav-
igation than street names (Ashweeni and Steed,
2006; Hiley et al, 2008). We will use visible
landmarks identified using the visibility engine to
make navigation instructions more effective, and
we plan to include entities in dialogue and visual
context as candidates for PoI push, and to imple-
ment an adaptive strategy that will estimate user
interests and push information that is of interest
to them. We are also taking advantage of user?s
local knowledge of the city to present navigation
instructions only for the part of the route that the
user does not have any knowledge of. These fea-
tures, we believe, will make users? experience of
the interface more pleasant, useful and informa-
tive.
9 Conclusion
We presented a mobile dialogue app called Space-
book to support pedestrian users in navigation
and tourist information gathering in urban envi-
ronments. The system is a speech-only interface
and addresses navigation and tourist information
in an integrated way, using a shared dialogue con-
text. For example, using the navigational context,
Spacebook can push point-of-interest information
which can then initiate touristic exploration tasks
using the QA module.
We evaluated the system against a state-of-the-
art baseline (Samsung S-Voice with Google Navi-
gation and Search) with a group of 17 users in the
streets of Edinburgh. We found that users found
Spacebook interesting to interact with, and that
it was their system of choice for touristic infor-
mation exploration tasks. These results were sta-
tistically significant. Based on observations and
user ratings, we conclude that our speech-only
system was less preferred for navigation and more
preferred for tourist information tasks due to fea-
tures such as PoI pushing and the integrated QA
module, when compared to the baseline system.
Younger users, who used Spacebook, even felt that
they learned new facts about the city.

Abstract
We demonstrate a spoken dialogue-based in-
formation system for pedestrians. The system
is novel in combining geographic information
system (GIS) modules such as a visibility en-
gine with a question-answering (QA) system,
integrated within a dialogue system architec-
ture. Users of the demonstration system can
use a web-based version (simulating pedes-
trian movement using StreetView) to engage
in a variety of interleaved conversations such
as navigating from A to B, using the QA func-
tionality to learn more about points of interest
(PoI) nearby, and searching for amenities and
tourist attractions. This system explores a va-
riety of research questions involving the inte-
gration of multiple information sources within
conversational interaction.
1 Motivation
Although navigation and local information are avail-
able to users through smartphone apps, there are still
important problems such as how such information is
delivered safely and proactively, and without cogni-
tively overloading the user. (Kray et al, 2003) sug-
gested that cognitive load of information presented
in textual and speech-based interfaces is medium
and low respectively when compared to more com-
plicated visual interfaces. Our objective, therefore,
is to build a hands-free and eyes-free system that en-
gages the pedestrian user by presenting all informa-
tion and receiving user requests through speech only.
In addition, and in contrast to other mobile ap-
plications, this system is conversational ? meaning
that it accumulates information over time, and plans
its utterances to achieve long-term goals. It inte-
grates with a city model and a visibility engine (Bar-
tie and Mackaness, 2012) to identify points of inter-
ests and visibile landmarks for presentation, a pedes-
trian tracker to improve the GPS positioning of the
user and a question-answering (QA) system to en-
able users to explore information about the city more
freely than with a graphical interface.
Table 1 presents an example dialogue interaction
with the system showing the use of visibility infor-
mation and Question-Answering.
User: Take me to Princes Street.
System: Turn left on to South Bridge and
walk towards the tower in front of you.
...
System: Near you is the famous statue of David Hume.
User: Tell me more about David Hume.
System: David Hume is a Scottish philosopher....
Table 1: An example interaction with the system
2 Related work
There are several mobile apps such as Triposo, Trip-
wolf, and Guidepal that provide point of interest
information, and apps such as Google Navigation
that provide navigation instructions to users. How-
ever, they demand the user?s visual attention because
they predominantly present information on a mobile
screen. In contrast, ours is a speech only interface
in order to keep the user?s cognitive load low and
avoid users from being distracted (perhaps danger-
134
ously so) from their primary task.
Generating navigation instructions in the real
world for pedestrians is an interesting research
problem in both computational linguistics and geo-
informatics (Dale et al, 2003; Richter and Duck-
ham, 2008). CORAL is an NLG system that gener-
ates navigation instructions incrementally upon user
requests based on the user?s location (Dale et al,
2003). DeepMap is a system that interacts with
the user to improve positioning using GUI controls
(Malaka and Zipf, 2000). SmartKom is a dialogue
system that presents navigation information multi-
modally (Reithinger et al, 2003). There are also
several mobile apps developed to help low-vision
users with navigation instructions (see (Stent et al,
2010) for example). In contrast to these earlier sys-
tems we present navigational, point-of-interest and
amenity information in an integrated way with users
interacting eyes-free and hands-free through a head-
set connected to a smartphone.
3 Architecture
The architecture of the current system is shown in
figure 1. The server side consists of a dialogue in-
terface (parser, interaction manager, and generator),
a City Model, a Visibility Engine, a QA server and a
Pedestrian tracker. On the user?s side is a web-based
client that consists of the simulated real-world and
the interaction panel.
Figure 1: System Architecture
3.1 Dialogue interface
The dialogue interface consists of an utterance
parser, an interaction manager and an utterance gen-
erator. The interaction manager is the central com-
ponent of this architecture, which provides the user
navigational instructions and interesting PoI infor-
mation. It receives the user?s input in the form of a
dialogue act and the user?s location in the form of
latitude and longitude information. Based on these
inputs and the dialogue context, it responds with sys-
tem output dialogue act (DA), based on a dialogue
policy. The utterance generator is a natural language
generation module that translates the system DA into
surface text, using the Open CCG toolkit (White et
al., 2007).
3.2 Pedestrian tracker
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (e.g.
GPS, GLONASS) provide a useful positioning so-
lution with minimal user side setup costs, for loca-
tion aware applications. However urban environ-
ments can be challenging with limited sky views,
and hence limited line of sight to the satellites, in
deep urban corridors. There is therefore signifi-
cant uncertainty about the user?s true location re-
ported by GNSS sensors on smartphones (Zandber-
gen and Barbeau, 2011). This module improves on
the reported user position by combining smartphone
sensor data (e.g. accelerometer) with map matching
techniques, to determine the most likely location of
the pedestrian (Bartie and Mackaness, 2012).
3.3 City Model
The city model is a spatial database containing in-
formation about thousands of entities in the city of
Edinburgh. These data have been collected from a
variety of existing resources such as Ordnance Sur-
vey, OpenStreetMap and the Gazetteer for Scotland.
It includes the location, use class, name, street ad-
dress, and where relevant other properties such as
build date. The model also includes a pedestrian net-
work (streets, pavements, tracks, steps, open spaces)
which can be used to calculate minimal cost routes,
such as the shortest path.
3.4 Visibility Engine
This module identifies the entities that are in the
user?s vista space (Montello, 1993). To do this it
accesses a digital surface model, sourced from Li-
DAR, which is a 2.5D representation of the city in-
cluding buildings, vegetation, and land surface ele-
vation. The visibility engine uses this dataset to offer
a number of services, such as determining the line
135
of sight from the observer to nominated points (e.g.
which junctions are visible), and determining which
entities within the city model are visible. These met-
rics can be then used by the interaction manager
to generate effective navigation instructions. E.g.
?Walk towards the castle?, ?Can you see the tower
in front of you??, ?Turn left after the large building
on your left after the junction? and so on.
3.5 Question-Answering server
The QA server currently answers a range of defini-
tion questions. E.g., ?Tell me more about the Scot-
tish Parliament?, ?Who was David Hume??, etc. QA
identifies the entity focused on in the question us-
ing machine-learning techniques (Mikhailian et al,
2009), and then proceeds to a textual search on texts
from the Gazetteer of Scotland and Wikipedia, and
definitions from WordNet glosses. Candidates are
reranked using a trained confidence score with the
top candidate used as the final answer. This answer
is provided as a flow of sentence chunks that the user
can interrupt. This information can also be pushed
by the system when a salient entity appears in the
user?s viewshed.
4 Web-based User interface
For the purposes of this (necessarily non-mobile)
demonstration, we present a web-based interface
that simulates users walking in a 3D city environ-
ment. Users will be able to provide speech or text
input (if the demonstration environment is too noisy
for usable speech recognition as is often the case at
conference demonstration sessions).
The web-based client is a JavaScript/HTML pro-
gram running on the user?s web browser. For a
detailed description of this component, please re-
fer to (Janarthanam et al, 2012). It consists of two
parts: the Streetview panel and the Interaction panel.
The Streetview panel presents a simulated real world
visually to the user. A Google Streetview client
(Google Maps API) is created with an initial user
coordinate which then allows the web user to get
a panoramic view of the streets around the user?s
virtual location. The user can walk around using
the arrow keys on his keyboard or the mouse. The
system?s utterances are synthesized using Cereproc
text-to-speech engine and presented to the user.

Abstract
We demonstrate a conversational interface
that assists pedestrian users in navigat-
ing within urban environments and acquir-
ing tourist information by combining spo-
ken dialogue system, question-answering
(QA), and geographic information sys-
tem (GIS) technologies. In contrast to
existing mobile applications which treat
these problems independently, our An-
droid agent addresses the problem of navi-
gation and touristic question-answering in
an integrated fashion using a shared dia-
logue context with multiple interleaved di-
alogue threads. In this paper, we present
the architecture and features of our lat-
est system, extended from an earlier ver-
sion which was built and evaluated with
real users (Janarthanam et al, 2013). The
new features include navigation based on
visible landmarks, navigation adapted to
the user?s previous route knowledge, and
tourist information pushing based on vis-
ible and proximal points-of-interest. The
system also uses social media to infer
?popularity? of geographical entities.
1 Introduction
We demonstrate a conversational interface that ad-
dresses the problems of pedestrian navigation and
Question Answering (QA) in urban environments,
which is an extended version of the system eval-
uated in (Janarthanam et al, 2013). Our system
brings together Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS)
and Question Answering (QA) with Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) for user positioning
and tracking, city modelling and urban visibility
modelling. There has been little prior work that
addresses these problems - navigation, visibility,
and tourist information provision - in an integrated
way. By navigation, we refer to the problem of
finding appropriate destinations to go to and the
task of wayfinding to reach them (Golledge, 1992;
Raubal and Winter, 2002) and by tourist informa-
tion provision we refer to the problem of meet-
ing the informational needs of a user about enti-
ties such as museums, statues, famous personal-
ities, etc. With the proliferation of smartphones,
there has been a number of mobile apps developed
to address these problems. However, these apps
have the following problems: first, they demand
the user?s visual attention because they predom-
inantly present information on a mobile screen.
This can be dangerous in urban environments, as
well as being distracting. Second, these apps ad-
dress the problems of navigation and tourist infor-
mation independently and do not employ a shared
interaction context. This means that users cannot
switch between tourist information and navigation
tasks in a natural and fluid manner.
User1: Take me to the National Museum.
System2: The National Museum is about 300 meters away ...
System3: At the KFC, turn left on to South Bridge ...
System4 : Near you is the statue of David Hume.
User2: Who is David Hume.
System5: David Hume was a Scottish philosopher....
User3: Tell me more about David Hume.
System6: He was one of the most important figures in.. ...
System7: You should be able to see the museum in front of you.
User4: Tell me more about the museum.

Table 1: An example interaction with SpaceBook
In contrast to existing mobile apps, we present
a system that has a speech-only interface and ad-
dresses navigation and QA in an integrated way.
Table 1 presents an example interaction with
our system showing the integrated use of navi-
gation and question-answering capabilities. Ut-
151
terance System4-8 shows the system?s capability
to push information from the QA system about
nearby points-of-interest (PoI) during a navigation
task, which the user can then follow-up on (in ut-
terances User2 and User3). The final 3 utterances
show a natural switch between navigation to an en-
tity and QA about that entity.
2 Related work
Mobile applications such as Siri, Google Maps
Navigation, Sygic, etc. address the problem of
navigation while applications like Triposo, Guide-
pal, Wikihood, etc. address the problem of tourist
information by presenting the user with descrip-
tive information about various points of interest
(PoI) in the city. While some exploratory applica-
tions present snippets of information about a pre-
compiled list of PoI, others applications dynam-
ically generate a list of PoI arranged based on
their proximity to the users. Users can also ob-
tain specific information about PoI using Search
applications. Also, since these navigation and ex-
ploratory/search applications do not address both
problems in an integrated way, users need to
switch between them and therefore lose interac-
tion context.
While most applications address these two
problems independently, some like Google Now,
Google Field Trip, etc, mix navigation with ex-
ploration. However, such applications present in-
formation primarily visually on the screen for the
user to read. In contrast, our system has the objec-
tive of keeping the user?s cognitive load low and
preventing users from being distracted (perhaps
dangerously so) from walking in the city (Kray et
al., 2003). Also, our system allows users to inter-
leave the two sub-tasks seamlessly and can keep
entities discussed in both tasks in shared context
(as shown in Table 1).
Several systems have addressed the issue of
pedestrian navigation (Malaka and Zipf, 2000;
Dale et al, 2003; Heinroth and Buhler, 2008).
Some dialogue systems deal with presenting in-
formation concerning points of interest (Ko et al,
2005; Misu and Kawahara, 2007; Kashioka et al,
2011). In contrast to all these earlier work, we
demonstrate a system that deals with both naviga-
tion and tourist information issues in an integrated
fashion.
Figure 1: System Architecture
3 Multithreaded dialogue management
The architecture of the current system is shown
in figure 1. The Interaction Manager (IM) is
the central component of this architecture, which
provides the user with navigational instructions,
pushes PoI information and manages QA ques-
tions. It receives the user?s input in the form of
a dialogue act (DA) from the ASR module and
the user?s location (latitude and longitude), orien-
tation and speed from the Pedestrian Tracker mod-
ule. Based on these inputs and the dialogue con-
text, the IM responds with a system output dia-
logue act. The Interaction Manager manages the
conversation using five coversational threads: di-
alogue control, response, navigation, question an-
swering, and PoI pushing. These different threads
represent the state of different dimensions of the
user-system conversation that interleave with each
other. Each of these threads generates a dialogue
action based on a dialogue policy. A dialogue pol-
icy is a mapping between dialogue states and dia-
logue actions, which are semantic representations
of what the system wants to say next. Dialogue
actions from the five threads are stored in five sep-
arate queues.
The queues are assigned priorities that decide
the order in which items from the queues will
be popped. For instance, informing the user of
a PoI could be delayed if the user needs to be
given an instruction to turn at the junction he is
approaching. For this reason, priority is assigned
to dialogue threads as follows.
Priority 1. Dialogue control (calibration phase,
repeat request, clarifications etc)
Priority 2. Responding to user requests
Priority 3. System initiated navigation task actions
Priority 4. Responses to User initiated QA actions
Priority 5. PoI Push actions

Dialogue control The IM initiates the conversa-
tion with a calibration phase where the user?s ini-
tial location and orientation are obtained. In this
phase, the IM requests the user to walk a few yards
so that the pedestrian tracker can sense the user?s
location and orientation. During the course of the
coversation, the IM uses this thread to manage
repeat requests, issues with unparsed user utter-
ances, utterances that have low ASR confidence,
and so on. The dialogue control thread is used to
manage reference resolution in cases where refer-
ring expressions are underspecified.
Navigation The IM identifies the location of the
destination entity and queries the City Model for a
route plan. The plan provides information such as
numbers of exits at junctions, the exit number the
user should take, turn angle, popularity index of
the street, and the slope of the road. In an attempt
to adapt the route instructions to user route knowl-
edge, the IM first picks the most popular street in
the plan and asks the users if they can get to the
street on their own. Also, the IM queries the Visi-
bility Engine (VE) for highly salient visible land-
marks (computed using Flickr tags) that can used
to direct the user. Instructions based on visible
landmarks are given whenever possible.
Question Answering The system also answers
ad hoc questions from the user (e.g. ?Who is David
Hume??, ?What is the Old College??, etc). These
are sent to the QA server and answered based on
responses from the QA server. The dialogue pol-
icy here is to answer the user?s question with the
first snippet available and ask the user to request
for more if interested.
Pushing PoI Information When the user is mo-
bile, the IM identifies points of interest on the
route based on two factors: proximity and visibil-
ity. Proximity push is done by checking for PoIs
near the user using high-scoring ones when there
are many, based on tourist popularity ratings in the
City Model. Visibility push is done by querying
the VE for salient entities visible to the user that
may be worth pushing. The dialogue policy is to
introduce the PoI entity along with visual descrip-
tors if available. The IM queries the QA server for
snippets on entity and if available, pushes them the
first snippet to the user. The user is encouraged to
ask for more if interested.
4 Conclusion
We demonstrate a mobile conversational system
to support pedestrian users in navigation and
question-answering tasks in urban environments.
The system is a speech-only interface and inter-
leaves navigation and tourist information in an in-
tegrated way, using a shared dialogue context. For
example, using the navigational context, our sys-
tem can push point-of-interest information which
can then initiate touristic exploration tasks using
the QA module. An evaluation of an earlier ver-
sion was reported in (Janarthanam et al, 2013).
