Abstract
UMLS::Similarity is freely available open
source software that allows a user to mea-
sure the semantic similarity or relatedness of
biomedical terms found in the Unified Medi-
cal Language System (UMLS). It is written in
Perl and can be used via a command line in-
terface, an API, or a Web interface.
1 Introduction
UMLS::Similarity1 implements a number of seman-
tic similarity and relatedness measures that are based
on the structure and content of the Unified Medical
Language System. The UMLS is a data warehouse
that provides a unified view of many medical termi-
nologies, ontologies and other lexical resources, and
is also freely available from the National Library of
Medicine.2
Measures of semantic similarity quantify the de-
gree to which two terms are similar based on their
proximity in an is-a hierarchy. These measures are
often based on the distance between the two con-
cepts and their common ancestor. For example, lung
disease and Goodpasture?s Syndrome share the con-
cept disease as a common ancestor. Or in general
English, scalpel and switchblade would be consid-
ered very similar since both are nearby descendents
of the concept knife.
However, concepts that are not technically similar
can still be very closely related. For example, Good-
pasture?s Syndrome and Doxycycline are not similar
?Contact author : bthomson@umn.edu.

2http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/
since they do not have a nearby common ancestor,
but they are very closely related since Doxycycline
is a possible treatment for Goodpasture?s Syndrome.
A more general example might be elbow and arm,
while they are not similar, an elbow is a part-of an
arm and is therefore very closely related. Measures
of relatedness quantify these types of relationships
by using information beyond that which is found
in an is-a hierarchy, which the UMLS contains in
abundance.
2 Related Work
Measures of semantic similarity and relatedness
have been used in a number of different biomedi-
cal and clinical applications. Early work relied on
the Gene Ontology (GO)3, which is a hierarchy of
terms used to describe genomic information. For
example, (Lord et al, 2003) measured the similar-
ity of gene sequence data and used this in an appli-
cation for conducting semantic searches of textual
resources. (Guo et al, 2006) used semantic simi-
larity measures to identify direct and indirect pro-
tein interactions within human regulatory pathways.
(Ne?ve?ol et al, 2006) used semantic similarity mea-
sures based on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)4
to evaluate automatic indexing of biomedical arti-
cles by measuring the similarity between their rec-
ommended terms and the gold standard index terms.
UMLS::Similarity was first released in 2009, and
since that time has been used in various different
applications. (Sahay and Ram, 2010) used it in a
3http://www.geneontology.org/
4http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh
28
health information search and recommendation sys-
tem. (Zhang et al, 2011) used the measures to
identify redundancy within clinical records, while
(Mathur and Dinakarpandian, 2011) used them to
help identify similar diseases. UMLS::Similarity
has also enabled the development and evaluation
of new measures by allowing them to be compared
to existing methods, e.g., (Pivovarov and Elhadad,
2012). Finally, UMLS::Similarity can serve as a
building block in other NLP systems, for exam-
ple UMLS::SenseRelate (McInnes et al, 2011) is a
word sense disambiguation system for medical text
based on semantic similarity and relatedness.
3 UMLS::Similarity
UMLS::Similarity is a descendent of Word-
Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al, 2004), which
implements various measures of similarity and
relatedness for WordNet.5 However, the structure,
nature, and size of the UMLS is quite different from
WordNet, and the adaptations from WordNet were
not always straightforward. One very significant
difference, for example, is that the UMLS is stored
in a MySQL database while WordNet has its own
customized storage format. As a result, the core
of UMLS::Similarity is different and offers a
great deal of functionality specific to the UMLS.
Table 1 lists the measures currently provided in
UMLS::Similarity (as of version 1.27).
The Web interface provides a subset of the func-
tionality offered by the API and command line inter-
face, and allows a user to utilize UMLS::Similarity
without requiring the installation of the UMLS
(which is an admittedly time?consuming process).
4 Unified Medical Language System
The UMLS is a data warehouse that includes over
100 different biomedical and clinical data resources.
One of the largest individual sources is the System-
atized Nomenclature of Medicine?Clinical Terms
(SNOMED CT), a comprehensive terminology cre-
ated for the electronic exchange of clinical health in-
formation. Perhaps the most fine?grained source is
the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), an on-
tology created for biomedical and clinical research.
One of the most popular sources is MeSH (MSH), a

These many different resources are semi-
automatically combined into the Metathesaurus,
which provides a unified view of nearly 3,000,000
different concepts. This is very important since the
same concept can exist in multiple different sources.
For example, the concept Autonomic nerve exists in
both SNOMED CT and FMA. The Metathesaurus
assigns synonymous concepts from multiple sources
a single Concept Unique Identifier (CUI). Thus
both Autonomic nerve concepts in SNOMED CT
and FMA are assigned the same CUI (C0206250).
These shared CUIs essentially merge multiple
sources into a single resource in the Metathesaurus.
Some sources in the Metathesaurus contain addi-
tional information about the concept such as syn-
onyms, definitions,6 and related concepts. Paren-
t/child (PAR/CHD) and broader/narrower (RB/RN)
are the main types of hierarchical relations between
concepts in the Metathesaurus. Parent/child rela-
tions are already defined in the sources before they
are integrated into the UMLS, whereas broader/-
narrower relations are added by the UMLS edi-
tors. For example, Splanchnic nerve has an is-a
relation with Autonomic nerve in FMA. This re-
lation is carried forward in the Metathesaurus by
creating a parent/child relation between the CUIs
C0037991 [Splanchnic nerve] and C0206250 [Au-
tonomic nerve].
6However, not all concepts in the UMLS have a definition.

5 Demonstration System
The UMLS::Similarity Web interface7 allows a user
to enter two terms or UMLS CUIs as input in term
boxes. The user can choose to calculate similarity or
relatedness by clicking on the Calculate Similarity
or Calculate Relatedness button. The user can also
choose which UMLS sources and relations should
be used in the calculation. For example, if the terms
finger and arm are entered and the Compute Simi-
larity button is pressed, the following is output:

The Results show the terms and their assigned
CUIs. If a term has multiple possible CUIs associ-
ated with it, UMLS::Similarity returns the CUI pair
that obtained the highest similarity score. In this
case, finger was assigned CUI C0016129 and arm
assigned CUI C0449516 and the resulting similarity
score for the path measure using the MeSH hierar-
chy was 0.25.
Additionally, the paths between the concepts and
their definitions are shown. The View Definitions
and View Shortest Path buttons show the definition
and shortest path between the concepts in a sepa-
rate window. In the example above, the shortest path
between finger (C0016129) and arm (C0446516) is
C0016129 (Finger, NOS) => C0018563 (Hand,
NOS) => C1140618 (Extremity, Upper) =>

C0446516 (Upper arm), and one of the definitions
shown for arm (C0446516) is The superior part
of the upper extremity between the shoulder and
the elbow.
SAB :: include and REL :: include are config-
uration parameters that define the sources and rela-
tions used to find the paths between the two CUIs
when measuring similarity. In the example above,
similarity was calculated using PAR/CHD relations
in the MeSH hierarchy.
All similarity measures default to the use of
MeSH as the source (SAB) with PAR/CHD rela-
tions. While these are reasonable defaults, for many
use cases these should be changed. Table 2 shows
the similarity scores returned for each measure us-
ing different sources. It also shows the number of
CUIs connected via PAR/CHD relations per source.
A similar view is displayed when pressing the
Compute Relatedness button:

Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-based
method to disambiguate biomedical acronyms
using second-order co-occurrence vectors. We
create these vectors using information about a
long-form obtained from the Unified Medical
Language System and Medline. We evaluate
this method on a dataset of 18 acronyms found
in biomedical text. Our method achieves an
overall accuracy of 89%. The results show
that using second-order features provide a dis-
tinct representation of the long-form and po-
tentially enhances automated disambiguation.
1 Introduction
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task
of automatically identifying the appropriate sense of
a word with multiple senses. For example, the word
culture could refer to anthropological culture
(e.g., the culture of the Mayan civilization), or a
laboratory culture (e.g., cell culture).
Acronym disambiguation is the task of automat-
ically identifying the contextually appropriate long-
form of an ambiguous acronym. For example, the
acronym MS could refer to the disease Multiple Scle-
rosis, the drug Morphine Sulfate, or the state Missis-
sippi, among others. Acronym disambiguation can
be viewed as a special case of WSD, although, un-
like terms, acronyms tend to be complete phrases
or expressions, therefore collocation features are
not as easily identified. For example, the feature
rate when disambiguating the term interest, as in
?Contact author : bthomson@umn.edu.
interest rate, may not be available. Acronyms also
tend to be noun phrases, therefore syntactic features
do not provide relevant information for the purposes
of disambiguation.
Identifying the correct long-form of an acronym
is important not only for the retrieval of information
but the understanding of the information by the re-
cipient. In general English, Park and Byrd (2001)
note that acronym disambiguation is not widely
studied because acronyms are not as prevalent in lit-
erature and newspaper articles as they are in specific
domains such as government, law, and biomedicine.
In the biomedical sublanguage domain, acronym
disambiguation is an extensively studied problem.
Pakhomov (2002) note acronyms in biomedical lit-
erature tend to be used much more frequently than in
news media or general English literature, and tend
to be highly ambiguous. For example, the Uni-
fied Medical Language System (UMLS), which in-
cludes one of the largest terminology resources in
the biomedical domain, contains 11 possible long-
forms of the acronym MS in addition to the four
examples used above. Liu et al (2001) show that
33% of acronyms are ambiguous in the UMLS. In a
subsequent study, Liu et al (2002a) found that 80%
of all acronyms found in Medline, a large repository
of abstracts from biomedical journals, are ambigu-
ous. Wren and Garner (2002) found that there exist
174,000 unique acronyms in the Medline abstracts
in which 36% of them are ambiguous. The authors
also estimated that the number of unique acronyms
is increasing at a rate of 11,000 per year.
Supervised and semi-supervised methods have
been used successfully for acronym disambiguation
145
but are limited in scope due to the need for sufficient
training data. Liu et al (2004) state that an acronym
could have approximately 16 possible long-forms in
Medline but could not obtain a sufficient number of
instances for each of the acronym-long-form pairs
for their experiments. Stevenson et al (2009) cite
a similar problem indicating that acronym disam-
biguation methods that do not require training data,
regardless if it is created manually or automatically,
are needed.
In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge-
based method to disambiguate acronyms using
second-order co-occurrence vectors. This method
does not rely on training data, and therefore, is not
limited to disambiguating only commonly occurring
possible long-forms. These vectors are created us-
ing the first-order features obtained from the UMLS
about the acronym?s long-forms and second-order
features obtained from Medline. We show that us-
ing second-order features provide a distinct repre-
sentation of the long-form for the purposes of dis-
ambiguation and obtains a significantly higher dis-
ambiguation accuracy than using first order features.
2 Unified Medical Language System
The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is
a data warehouse that stores a number of distinct
biomedical and clinical resources. One such re-
source, used in this work, is the Metathesaurus.
The Metathesaurus contains biomedical and clin-
ical concepts from over 100 disparate terminol-
ogy sources that have been semi-automatically in-
tegrated into a single resource containing a wide
range of biomedical and clinical information. For
example, it contains the Systematized Nomencla-
ture of Medicine?Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT),
which is a comprehensive clinical terminology cre-
ated for the electronic exchange of clinical health
information, the Foundational Model of Anatomy
(FMA), which is an ontology of anatomical concepts
created specifically for biomedical and clinical re-
search, and MEDLINEPLUS, which is a terminol-
ogy source containing health related concepts cre-
ated specifically for consumers of health services.
The concepts in these sources can overlap. For
example, the concept Autonomic nerve exists in both
SNOMED CT and FMA. The Metathesaurus assigns
the synonymous concepts from the various sources
a Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). Thus both
the Autonomic nerve concepts in SNOMED CT and
FMA are assigned the same CUI (C0206250). This
allows multiple sources in the Metathesaurus to be
treated as a single resource.
Some sources in the Metathesaurus contain ad-
ditional information about the concept such as a
concept?s synonyms, its definition and its related
concepts. There are two main types of relations
in the Metathesaurus that we use: the parent/child
and broader/narrower relations. A parent/child re-
lation is a hierarchical relation between two con-
cepts that has been explicitly defined in one of the
sources. For example, the concept Splanchnic nerve
has an is-a relation with the concept Autonomic
nerve in FMA. This relation is carried forward to
the CUI level creating a parent/child relations be-
tween the CUIs C0037991 (Splanchnic nerve) and
C0206250 (Autonomic nerve) in the Metathesaurus.
A broader/narrower relation is a hierarchical relation
that does not explicitly come from a source but is
created by the UMLS editors. We use the entire
UMLS including the RB/RN and PAR/CHD rela-
tions in this work.
3 Medline
Medline (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
System Online) is a bibliographic database contain-
ing over 18.5 million citations to journal articles
in the biomedical domain which is maintained by
the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The 2010
Medline Baseline, used in this study, encompasses
approximately 5,200 journals starting from 1948 and
is 73 Gigabytes; containing 2,612,767 unique uni-
grams and 55,286,187 unique bigrams. The majority
of the publications are scholarly journals but a small
number of newspapers, and magazines are included.
4 Acronym Disambiguation
Existing acronym disambiguation methods can be
classified into two categories: form-based and
context-based methods. Form-based methods, such
as the methods proposed by Taghva and Gilbreth
(1999), Pustejovsky et al (2001), Schwartz and
Hearst (2003) and Nadeau and Turney (2005), dis-
ambiguate the acronym by comparing its letters di-
146
rectly to the initial letters in the possible long-forms
and, therefore, would have difficulties in distin-
guishing between acronyms with similar long-forms
(e.g., RA referring to Refractory anemia or Rheuma-
toid arthritis).
In contrast, context-based methods disambiguate
between acronyms based on the context in which the
acronym is used with the assumption that the context
surrounding the acronym would be different for each
of the possible long-forms. In the remainder of this
section, we discuss these types of methods in more
detail.
4.1 Context-based Acronym Disambiguation
Methods
Liu et al (2001) and Liu et al (2002b) introduce
a semi-supervised method in which training and
test data are automatically created by extracting ab-
stracts from Medline that contain the acronym?s
long-forms. The authors use collocations and a bag-
of-words approach to train a Naive Bayes algorithm
and report an accuracy of 97%. This method be-
gins to treat acronym disambiguation as more of a
WSD problem by looking at the context in which
the acronym exists to determine its long-form, rather
than the long-form itself. In a subsequent study, Liu
et al (2004) explore using additional features and
machine learning algorithms and report an accuracy
of 99% using the Naive Bayes.
Joshi (2006) expands on Liu, et als work. They
evaluate additional machine learning algorithms us-
ing unigrams, bigrams and trigrams as features.
They found that given their feature set, SVMs ob-
tain the highest accuracy (97%).
Stevenson et al (2009) re-recreate this dataset us-
ing the method described in Liu et al (2001) to auto-
matically create training data for their method which
uses a mixture of linguistics features (e.g., colloca-
tions, unigrams, bigrams and trigrams) in combina-
tion with the biomedical features CUIs and Medi-
cal Subject Headings, which are terms manually as-
signed to Medline abstracts for indexing purposes.
The authors evaluate the Naive Bayes, SVM and
Vector Space Model (VSM) described by Agirre and
Martinez (2004), and report that VSM obtained the
highest accuracy (99%).
Pakhomov (2002) also developed a semi-
supervised method in which training data was
automatically created by first identifying the long-
form found in the text of clinical reports, replacing
the long-form with the acronym to use as training
data. A maximum entropy model trained and tested
on a corpus of 10,000 clinical notes achieved an
accuracy of 89%. In a subsequent study, Pakhomov
et al (2005) evaluate obtaining training data from
three sources: Medline, clinical records and the
world wide web finding using a combination of
instances from clinical records and the web obtained
the highest accuracy.
Joshi et al (2006) compare using the Naive
Bayes, Decision trees and SVM on ambiguous
acronyms found in clinical reports. The authors
use the part-of-speech, the unigrams and the bi-
grams of the context surrounding the acronym as
features. They evaluate their method on 7,738
manually disambiguated instances of 15 ambiguous
acronyms obtaining an accuracy of over 90% for
each acronym.
5 Word Sense Disambiguation
Many knowledge-based WSD methods have been
developed to disambiguate terms which are closely
related to the work presented in this paper. Lesk
(1986) proposes a definition overlap method in
which the appropriate sense of an ambiguous term
was determined based on the overlap between its
definition in a machine readable dictionary (MRD).
Ide and Ve?ronis (1998) note that this work provided
a basis for most future MRD disambiguation meth-
ods; including the one presented in this paper.
Banerjee and Pedersen (2002) use the Lesk?s
overlap method to determine the relatedness be-
tween two concepts (synsets) in WordNet. They ex-
tend the method to not only include the definition
(gloss) of the two synsets in the overlap but also the
glosses of related synsets.
Wilks et al (1990) expand upon Lesk?s method by
calculating the number of times the words in the def-
inition co-occur with the ambiguous words. In their
method, a vector is created using the co-occurrence
information for the ambiguous word and each of its
possible senses. The similarity is then calculated be-
tween the ambiguous word?s vector and each of the
sense vectors. The sense whose vector is most simi-
lar is assigned to the ambiguous word.

Figure 1: 2nd Order Vector for Fructose Diphosphate (FDP)
Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) introduce a vec-
tor measure to determine the relatedness between
pairs of concepts. In this measure, a second order
co-occurrence vector is created for each concept us-
ing the words in each of the concepts definition and
calculating the cosine between the two vectors. This
method has been used in the task of WSD by calcu-
lating the relatedness between each possible sense
of the ambiguous word and its surrounding context.
The context whose sum is the most similar is as-
signed to the ambiguous word.
Second-order co-occurrence vectors were first in-
troduced by Schu?tze (1992) for the task of word
sense discrimination and later extended by Puran-
dare and Pedersen (2004). As noted by Pedersen
(2010), disambiguation requires a sense-inventory
in which the long-forms are known ahead of time,
where as in discrimination this information is not
known a priori.
6 Method
In our method, a second-order co-occurrence vec-
tor is created for each possible long-form of the
acronym, and the acronym itself. The appropriate
long-form of the acronym is then determined by
computing a cosine between the vector represent-
ing the ambiguous acronym and each of the vectors
representing the long-forms. The long-form whose
vector has the smallest angle between it and the
acronym vector is chosen as the most likely long-
form of the acronym.
To create a second-order vector for a long-form,
we first obtain a textual description of the long-form
in the UMLS, which we refer to as the extended defi-
nition. Each long-form, from our evaluation set, was
mapped to a concept in the UMLS, therefore, we use
the long-form?s definition plus the definition of its
parent/children and narrow/broader relations and the
terms in the long-form.
We include the definition of the related concepts
because not all concepts in the UMLS have a defini-
tion. In our evaluation dataset, not a single acronym
has a definition for each possible long-form. On
average, each extended definition contains approx-
imately 453 words. A short example of the extended
definition for the acronym FDP when referring to
148
fructose diphosphate is: ? Diphosphoric acid esters
of fructose. The fructose diphosphate isomer is most
prevalent. fructose diphosphate.?
After the extended definition is obtained, we cre-
ate the second-order vector by first creating a word
by word co-occurrence matrix in which the rows
represent the content words in the long-forms, ex-
tended definition, and the columns represent words
that co-occur in Medline abstracts with the words in
the definition. Each cell in this matrix contains the
Log Likelihood Ratio (Dunning (1993)) of the word
found in the row and the word in the column. Sec-
ond, each word in the long-forms, extended defini-
tion is replaced by its corresponding vector, as given
in the co-occurrence matrix. The centroid of these
vectors constitutes the second order co-occurrence
vector used to represent the long-form.
For example, given the example corpus contain-
ing two instances: 1) The metabolites, glucose fruc-
tose and their phosphoric acid esters are changed
due to the effect of glycolytic enzymes, and 2)
The phosphoric acid combined with metabolites de-
creases the intensity. Figure 1 shows how the
second-order co-occurrence vector is created for the
long-form fructose diphosphate using the extended
definition and features from our given corpus above.
The second-order co-occurrence vector for the
ambiguous acronym is created in a similar fashion,
only rather than using words in the extended defini-
tion, we use the words surrounding the acronym in
the instance.
Vector methods are subject to noise introduced by
features that do not distinguish between the differ-
ent long-forms of the acronym. To reduce this type
of noise, we select the features to use in the second
order co-occurrence vectors based on the following
criteria: 1) second order feature cannot be a stop-
word, and 2) second order feature must occur at least
twice in the feature extraction dataset and not occur
more than 150 times. We also experiment with the
location of the second-order feature with respect to
the first-order feature by varying the window size of
zero, four, six and ten words to the right and the left
of the first-order feature. The experiments in this
paper were conducted using CuiTools v0.15. 1
Our method is different from other context-based
1http://cuitools.sourceforge.net
acronym disambiguation methods discussed in the
related work because it does not require annotated
training data for each acronym that needs to be dis-
ambiguated. Our method differs from the method
proposed by Wilks et al (1990) in two fundamen-
tal aspects: 1) using the extended definition of
the possible long-forms of an acronym, and 2) using
second-order vectors to represent the instance con-
taining the acronym and each of the acronym?s pos-
sible long-forms.
7 Data
7.1 Acronym Dataset
We evaluated our method on the ?Abbrev? dataset 2
made available by Stevenson et al (2009). The
acronyms and long-forms in the data were initially
presented by Liu et al (2001). Stevenson et al
(2009) automatically re-created this dataset by iden-
tifying the acronyms and long-forms in Medline ab-
stracts and replacing the long-form in the abstract
with its acronym. Each abstract contains approxi-
mately 216 words. The dataset consists of three sub-
sets containing 100 instances, 200 instances and 300
instances of the ambiguous acronym referred to as
Abbrev.100, Abbrev.200, Abbrev.300, respectively.
The acronyms long-forms were manually mapped to
concepts in the UMLS by Stevenson, et al
A sufficient number of instances were not found
for each of the 21 ambiguous acronyms by Steven-
son et al (2009). For example, ?ASP? only con-
tained 71 instances and therefore not included in any
of the subsets. ?ANA? and ?FDP? only contained
just over 100 instances and therefore, are only in-
cluded in the Abbrev.100 subset. ?ACE?, ?ASP?
and ?CSF? were also excluded because several of
the acronyms? long-forms did not occur frequently
enough in Medline to create a balanced dataset.
We evaluate our method on the same subsets that
Stevenson et al (2009) used to evaluate their super-
vised method. The average number of long-forms
per acronym is 2.6 and the average majority sense
across all subsets is 70%.
7.2 Feature Extraction Dataset
We use abstracts from Medline, containing ambigu-
ous acronym or long-form, to create the second-

scribed in Section 6. Table 1 shows the number of

Table 2: Overall Disambiguation Results
The majority sense baseline is often used to evalu-
ate supervised learning algorithms and indicates the
accuracy that would be achieved by assigning the
most frequent sense (long-form) to every instance.
The results in Table 2 demonstrate that our method is
significantly more accurate than the majority sense
baseline (p ? 0.01).
We compare the results using second-order vec-
tors to first-order vectors. Table 2 shows that ac-
curacy of the second-order results is significantly
higher than the first-order results (p ? 0.01).
The results in Table 2 also show that, as the win-
dow size grows from zero to six, the accuracy of the
system increases and plateaus at a window size of
ten. There is no statistically significant difference
between using a window size of six and ten but there
is a significant difference between a window size of
zero and six, as well as four and six (p ? 0.01).

9 Error Analysis
Table 3 shows the results obtained by our method for
the individual acronyms using a window size of six,
and the number of possible long-forms per acronym.
Of the 18 acronyms, three obtain an accuracy below
80 percent: FDP, MCP and PCA.
FPD has four possible long-forms: Fructose
Diphosphate (E1), Formycin Diphosphate (E2), Fib-
rinogen Degradation Product (E3) and Flexor Dig-
itorum Profundus (E4). The confusion matrix in
Table 4 shows that the method was unable to dis-
tinguish between the two long-forms, E1 and E2,
which are both diphosphates, nor E2 and E3.

MCP also has four possible long-forms: Multicat-
alytic Protease (E1), Metoclopramide (E2), Mono-
cyte Chemoattractant Protein (E3) and Membrane

Cofactor Protein (E4). The confusion matrix in Ta-

guish between E3 and E4, which are both proteins,
and E1, which is a protease (an enzyme that breaks
down a protein).

PCA has four possible long-forms: Passive Cu-

trix in Table 6 shows that the method was not able
to distinguish between E2 and E3. Analyzing the
extended definitions of the concepts showed that E2
includes the definition to the concept Pain Manage-
ment. The words in this definition overlap with
many of the words used in E3s extended definition.

10 Comparison with Previous Work
Of the previously developed methods, Liu et al
(2004) and Stevenson et al (2009) evaluated their
semi-supervised methods on the same dataset as we
used for the current study. A direct comparison
can not be made between our method and Liu et al
(2004) because we do not have an exact duplication
of the dataset that they use. Their results are com-
parable to Stevenson et al (2009) with both report-
ing results in the high 90s. Our results are directly
comparable to Stevenson et al (2009) who report
an overall accuracy of 98%, 98% and 99% on the
Abbrev.100, Abbrev.200 and Abbrev.300 datasets
respectively. This is approximately 10 percentage
points higher than our results.
The advantage of the methods proposed by
Stevenson et al (2009) and Liu et al (2004) is that
they are semi-supervised which have been shown to
obtain higher accuracies than methods that do not
use statistical machine learning algorithms. The dis-
advantage is that sufficient training data are required
for each possible acronym-long-form pair. Liu et
al. (2004) state that an acronym could have approxi-
mately 16 possible long-forms in Medline but a suf-
ficient number of instances for each of the acronym-
long-form pairs were not found in Medline and,
therefore, evaluated their method on 15 out of the
original 34 acronyms. Stevenson et al (2009) cite
a similar problem in re-creating this dataset. This
shows the limitation to these methods is that a suffi-
cient number of training examples can not be ob-
tained for each acronym that needs to be disam-
biguated. The method proposed in the paper does
not have this limitation and can be used to disam-
biguate any acronym in Medline.
11 Discussion
In this paper, we presented a novel method to disam-
biguate acronyms in biomedical text using second-
order features extracted from the UMLS and Med-
line. The results show that using second-order fea-
tures provide a distinct representation of the long-
form that is useful for disambiguation.
We believe that this is because biomedical text
contains technical terminology that has a rich source
of co-occurrence information associated with them
due to their compositionality. Using second-order
information works reasonably well because when
the terms in the extended definition are broken up
into their individual words, information is not being
lost. For example, the term Patient Controlled Anal-
gesia can be understood by taking the union of the
meanings of the three terms and coming up with an
appropriate definition of the term (patient has con-
trol over their analgesia).
We evaluated various window sizes to extract the
second-order co-occurrence information from, and
found using locally occurring words obtains a higher
accuracy. This is consistent with the finding reported
by Choueka and Lusignan (1985) who conducted an
experiment to determine what size window is needed
for humans to determine the appropriate sense of an
ambiguous word.
The amount of data used to extract the second-
151
order features for each ambiguous acronym varied
depending on its occurrence in Medline. Table 1 in
Section 7.2 shows the number of abstracts in Med-
line used for each acronym. We compared the accu-
racy obtained by our method using a window size of
six on the Abbrev.100 dataset with the number of ab-
stracts in the feature extraction data. We found that
the accuracy was not correlated with the amount of
data used (r = 0.07). This confirms that it is not the
quantity but the content of the contextual informa-
tion that determines the accuracy of disambiguation.
We compared using second-order features and
first-order features showing that the second-order re-
sults obtained a significantly higher accuracy. We
believe that this is because the definitions of the pos-
sible concepts are too sparse to provide enough in-
formation to distinguish between them. This find-
ing coincides to that of Purandare and Pedersen
(2004) and Pedersen (2010) who found that with
large amounts of data, first-order vectors perform
better than second-order vectors, but second-order
vectors are a good option when large amounts of
data are not available.
The results of the error analysis indicate that
for some acronyms using the extended definition
does not provide sufficient information to make
finer grained distinctions between the long-forms.
This result also indicates that, although many long-
forms of acronyms can be considered coarse-grained
senses, this is not always the case. For example, the
analysis of MCP showed that two of its possible
long-forms are proteins which are difficult to differ-
entiate from given the context.
The results of the error analysis also show that
indicative collocation features for acronyms are not
easily identified because acronyms tend to be com-
plete phrases. For example, two of the possible
long-forms of DF are Fructose Diphosphate and
Formycin Diphosphate.
Two main limitations of this work must be men-
tioned to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
The first is the small number of acronyms and the
small number of long-forms per acronym in the
dataset; however, the acronyms in this dataset are
representative of the kinds of acronyms one would
expect to see in biomedical text. The second limita-
tion is that the dataset contains only those acronyms
whose long-forms were found in Medline abstracts.
The main goal of this paper was to determine if the
context found in the long-forms, extended definition
was distinct enough to distinguish between them us-
ing second-order vectors. For this purpose, we feel
that the dataset was sufficient although a more ex-
tensive dataset may be needed in the future for im-
proved coverage.
12 Future Work
In the future, we plan to explore three different
avenues. The first avenue is to look at obtaining
contextual descriptions of the possible long-forms
from resources other than the UMLS such as the
MetaMapped Medline baseline and WordNet. The
second avenue is limiting the features that are used
in the instance vectors. The first-order features in
the instance vector contain the words from the entire
abstract. As previously mentioned, vector methods
are subject to noise, therefore, in the future we plan
to explore using only those words that are co-located
next to the ambiguous acronym. The third avenue is
expanding the vector to allow for terms. Currently,
we use word vectors, in the future, we plan to extend
the method to use terms, as identified by the UMLS,
as features rather than single words.
We also plan to test our approach in the clinical
domain. We believe that acronym disambiguation
may be more difficult in this domain due to the in-
crease amount of long-forms as seen in the datasets
used by Joshi et al (2006) and Pakhomov (2002).
13 Conclusions
Our study constitutes a significant step forward in
the area of automatic acronym ambiguity resolu-
tion, as it will enable the incorporation of scalable
acronym disambiguation into NLP systems used for
indexing and retrieval of documents in specialized
domains such as medicine. The advantage of our
method over previous methods is that it does not re-
quire manually annotated training for each acronym
to be disambiguated while still obtaining an overall
accuracy of 89%.

Abstract
The Ngram Statistics Package (Text::NSP)
is freely available open-source software that
identifies ngrams, collocations and word as-
sociations in text. It is implemented in Perl
and takes advantage of regular expressions to
provide very flexible tokenization and to allow
for the identification of non-adjacent ngrams.
It includes a wide range of measures of associ-
ation that can be used to identify collocations.
1 Introduction
The identification of multiword expressions is a key
problem in Natural Language Processing. Despite
years of research, there is still no single best way
to proceed. As such, the availability of flexible and
easy to use toolkits remains important. Text::NSP
is one such package, and includes programs for
counting ngrams (count.pl, huge-count.pl), measur-
ing the association between the words that make up
an ngram (statistic.pl), and for measuring correlation
between the rankings of ngrams created by differ-
ent measures (rank.pl). It is also able to identify n-
th order co-occurrences (kocos.pl) and pre?specified
compound words in text (find-compounds.pl).
This paper briefly describes each component of
NSP. Additional details can be found in (Banerjee
and Pedersen, 2003) or in the software itself, which
is freely available from CPAN 1 or Sourceforge 2.

2 count.pl
The program count.pl takes any number of plain
text files or directories of such files and counts the
total number of ngrams as well their marginal to-
tals. It provides the ability to define what a token
may be using regular expressions (via the --token
option). An ngram is an ordered sequence of n to-
kens, and under this scheme tokens may be almost
anything, including space separated strings, charac-
ters, etc. Also, ngrams may be made up of nonadja-
cent tokens due to the --window option that allows
users to specify the number of tokens within which
an ngram must occur.
Counting is done using hashes in Perl which are
memory intensive. As a result, NSP also provides
the huge-count.pl program and various other huge-
*.pl utilities that carry out count.pl functionality us-
ing hard drive space rather than memory. This can
scale to much larger amounts of text, although usu-
ally taking more time in the process.
By default count.pl treats ngrams as ordered se-
quences of tokens; dog house is distinct from house
dog. However, it may be that order does not always
matter, and a user may simply want to know if two
words co-occur. In this case the combig.pl program
adjusts counts from count.pl to reflect an unordered
count, where dog house and house dog are consid-
ered the same. Finally, find-compounds.pl allows a
user to specify a file of already known multiword ex-
pressions (like place names, idioms, etc.) and then
identify all occurrences of those in a corpus before
running count.pl

3 statistic.pl
The core of NSP is a wide range of measures of
association that can be used to identify interest-
ing ngrams, particularly bigrams and trigrams. The
measures are organized into families that share com-
mon characteristics (which are described in detail in
the source code documentation). This allows for an
object oriented implementation that promotes inher-
itance of common functionality among these mea-
sures. Note that all of the Mutual Information mea-
sures are supported for trigrams, and that the Log-
likelihood ratio is supported for 4-grams. The mea-
sures in the package are shown grouped by family
in Table 1, where the name by which the measure is
known in NSP is in parentheses.
Table 1: Measures of Association in NSP
Mutual Information (MI)
(ll) Log-likelihood Ratio (Dunning, 1993)
(tmi) true MI (Church and Hanks, 1990)
(pmi) Pointwise MI (Church and Hanks, 1990)
(ps) Poisson-Stirling (Church, 2000)
Fisher?s Exact Test (Pedersen et al, 1996)
(leftFisher) left tailed
(rightFisher) right tailed
(twotailed) two tailed
Chi-squared
(phi) Phi Coefficient (Church, 1991)
(tscore) T-score (Church et al, 1991)
(x2) Pearson?s Chi-Squared (Dunning, 1993)
Dice
(dice) Dice Coefficient (Smadja, 1993)
(jaccard) Jaccard Measure
(odds) Odds Ratio (Blaheta and Johnson, 2001)
3.1 rank.pl
One natural experiment is to compare the output of
statistic.pl for the same input using different mea-
sures of association. rank.pl takes as input the out-
put from statistic.pl for two different measures, and
computes Spearman?s Rank Correlation Coefficient
between them. In general, measures within the same
family correlate more closely with each other than
with measures from a different family. As an ex-
ample tmi and ll as well as dice and jaccard differ
by only constant terms and therefore produce identi-
cal rankings. It is often worthwhile to conduct ex-
ploratory studies with multiple measures, and the
rank correlation can help recognize when two mea-
sures are very similar or different.
4 kocos.pl
In effect kocos.pl builds a word network by finding
all the n-th order co-occurrences for a given literal
or regular expression. This can be viewed somewhat
recursively, where the 3-rd order co-occurrences of
a given target word are all the tokens that occur with
the 2-nd order co-occurrences, which are all the to-
kens that occur with the 1-st order (immediate) co-
occurrences of the target. kocos.pl outputs chains of
the form king -> george -> washington,
where washington is a second order co-occurrence
(of king) since both king and washington are first
order co-occurrences of george. kocos.pl takes as
input the output from count.pl, combig.pl, or statis-
tic.pl.
5 API
In addition to command line support, Test::NSP of-
fers an extensive API for Perl programmers. All of
the measures described in Table 1 can be included
in Perl programs as object?oriented method calls
(Kohli, 2006), and it is also easy to add new mea-
sures or modify existing measures within a program.
6 Development History of Text::NSP
The Ngram Statistics Package was originally imple-
mented by Satanjeev Banerjee in 2000-2002 (Baner-
jee and Pedersen, 2003). Amruta Purandare in-
corporated NSP into SenseClusters (Purandare and
Pedersen, 2004) and added huge-count.pl, com-
big.pl and kocos.pl in 2002-2004. Bridget McInnes
added the log-likelihood ratio for longer ngrams
in 2003-2004 (McInnes, 2004). Saiyam Kohli
rewrote the measures of association to use object-
oriented methods in 2004-2006, and also added
numerous new measures for bigrams and trigams
(Kohli, 2006). Mahesh Joshi improved cross plat-
form support and created an NSP wrapper for Gate
in 2005-2006. Ying Liu wrote find-compounds.pl
and rewrote huge-count.pl in 2010-2011.
