Abstract
This paper proposes a method of speech inten-
tion understanding based on dialogue examples.
The method uses a spoken dialogue corpus with
intention tags to regard the intention of each in-
put utterance as that of the sentence to which it
is the most similar in the corpus. The degree of
similarity is calculated according to the degree
of correspondence in morphemes and dependen-
cies between sentences, and it is weighted by
the dialogue context information. An exper-
iment on inference of utterance intentions us-
ing a large-scale in-car spoken dialogue corpus
of CIAIR has shown 68.9% accuracy. Further-
more, we have developed a prototype system of
in-car spoken dialogue processing for a restau-
rant retrieval task based on our method, and
confirmed the feasiblity of the system.
1 Introduction
In order to interact with a user naturally and
smoothly, it is necessary for a spoken dialogue
system to understand the intentions of utter-
ances of the user exactly. As a method of speech
intention understanding, Kimura et al has pro-
posed a rule-based approach (Kimura et al,
1998). They have defined 52 kinds of utterance
intentions, and constructed rules for inferring
the intention from each utterance by taking ac-
count of the intentions of the last utterances, a
verb, an aspect of the input utterance, and so
on. The huge work for constructing the rules,
however, cannot help depending on a lot of
hands, and it is also difficult to modify the rules.
On the other hand, a technique for tagging di-
alogue acts has been proposed so far (Araki et
al., 2001). For the purpose of concretely deter-
mining the operations to be done by the system,
the intention to be inferred should be more de-
tailed than the level of dialogue act tags such as
?yes-no question? and ?wh question?.
This paper proposes a method of understand-
ing speeches intentions based on a lot of dia-
logue examples. The method uses the corpus in
which the utterance intention has given to each
sentence in advance. We have defined the ut-
terance intention tags by extending an annota-
tion scheme of dialogue act tags, called JDTAG
(JDRI, 2000), and arrived at 78 kinds of tags
presently. To detail an intention even on the
level peculiar to the task enables us to describe
the intention linking directly to operations of
the system.
In the technique for the intention inference,
the degree of similarity of each input utter-
ance with every sentence in a corpus is calcu-
lated. The calculation is based on the degree of
morphologic correspondence and that of depen-
dency correspondence. Furthermore, the degree
of similarity is weighted by using dialogue con-
text information. The intention of the utterance
to which the maximum score is given in the cor-
pus, will be accepted as that of the input utter-
ance. Our method using dialogue examples has
the advantage that it is not necessary to con-
struct rules for inferring the intention of every
utterance and that the system can also robustly
cope with the diversity of utterances.
An experiment on intention inference has
been made by using a large-scale corpus of spo-
ken dialogues. The experimental result, provid-
ing 68.9% accuracy, has shown our method to
be feasible and effective. Furthermore, we have
developed, based on our method, a prototype
system of in-car spoken dialogue processing for
a restaurant retrieval task, and confirmed the
feasiblity of the system.

2 Outline of Example-based
Approach
Intentions of a speaker would appear in the vari-
ous types of phenomenon relevant to utterances,
such as phonemes, morphemes, keywords, sen-
tential structures, and contexts. An example-
based approach is expected to be effective for
developing the system which can respond to the
human?s complicated and diverse speeches. A
dialogue corpus, in which a tag showing an ut-
terance intention is given to each sentence, is
used for our approach. In the below, the outline
of our method is explained by using an inference
example.
Figure 1 shows the flow of our intention
inference processing for an input utterance
?Chikaku-ni chushajo-wa aru-ka-na ? (Is there
a parking lot nearby?)?. First, morphological
analysis and dependency analysis to the utter-
ance are carried out.
Then, the degree of similarity of each input
utterance with sentences in the corpus can be
calculated by using the degree of correspon-
dence since the information on both morphol-
ogy and dependency are given to all sentences
in the corpus in advance. In order to raise the
accuracy of the intention inference, moreover,
the context information is taken into consid-
eration. That is, according to the occurrence
probability of a sequence of intentions learned
from a dialogue corpus with the intention tags,
the degree of similarity with each utterance is
weighted based on the intentions of the last ut-
terances. Consequently, if the utterance whose
degree of similarity with the input utterance is
the maximum is ?sono chikaku-ni chushajo ari-
masu-ka? (Is there a parking lot near there?)?,
the intention of the input utterance is regarded
as ?parking lot question?.
3 Similarity and its Calculation
This section describes a technique for calculat-
ing the degree of similarity between sentences
using the information on both dependency and
morphology.
3.1 Degree of Similarity between
Sentences
In order to calculate the degree of similarity be-
tween two sentences, it can be considered to
make use of morphology and dependency infor-
mation. The calculation based on only mor-
phemes means that the similarity of only sur-
face words is taken into consideration, and thus
the result of similarity calculation may become
large even if they are not so similar from a struc-
tural point of view. On the other hand, the cal-
culation based on only dependency relations has
the problem that it is difficult to express the lex-
ical meanings for the whole sentence, in partic-
ular, in the case of spoken language. By using
both the information on morphology and de-
pendency, it can be expected to carry out more
reliable calculation.
Formula (1) defines the degree of similarity
between utterances as the convex combination
? of the degree of similarity on dependency, ?d,
and that on morpheme, ?m.
? = ??d + (1 ? ?)?m (1)
?d : the degree of similarity in dependency
?m: the degree of similarity in morphology
? : the weight coefficient (0 ? ? ? 1)
Section 3.2 and 3.3 explain ?d and ?m, re-
spectively.
3.2 Dependency Similarity
Generally speaking, a Japanese dependency re-
lation means the modification relation between
a bunsetsu and a bunsetsu. For example,
a spoken sentence ?kono chikaku-ni washoku-
no mise aru? (Is there a Japanese restau-
rant near here?)? consists of five bunsetsus of
?kono (here)?, ?chikaku-ni (near)?, ?washoku-
no (Japanese-style food)?, ?mise (a restau-
rant)?, ?aru (being)?, and there exist some de-
pendencies such that ?mise? modifies ?aru?. In
the case of this instance, the modifying bun-
setsu ?mise? and the modified bunsetsu ?aru?
are called dependent and head, respectively. It
is said that these two bunsetsus are in a depen-
dency relation. Likewise, ?kono?, ?chikaku-ni?
and ?washoku-no? modify ?chikaku-ni?, ?aru?
and ?mise?, respectively. In the following of this
paper, a dependency relation is expressed as the
order pair of bunsetsus like (mise, aru), (kono,
chikaku-ni).
A dependency relation expresses a part of
syntactic and semantic characteristics of the
sentence, and can be strongly in relation to the
intentional content. That is, it can be expected
that two utterances whose dependency relations
are similar each other have a high possibility
that the intentions are also so.
A formula (2) defines the degree of similar-
ity in Japanese dependency, ?D, between two
utterances SA and SB as the degree of corre-
spondence between them.
?d =
2CD
DA + DB
(2)
DA: the number of dependencies in SA
DB: the number of dependencies in SB
CD : the number of dependencies in corre-
spondence
Here, when the basic forms of independent
words in a head bunsetsu and in a dependent
bunsetsu correspond with each other, these de-
pendency relations are considered to be in cor-
respondence. For example, two dependencies
(chikaku-ni, aru) and (chikaku-ni ari-masu-ka)
correspond with each other because the inde-
pendent words of the head bunsetsu and the de-
pendent bunsetsu are ?chikaku? and ?aru?, re-
spectively. Moreover, each word class is given
to nouns and proper nouns characteristic of a
dialogue task. If a word which constitutes each
dependency belongs to the same class, these de-
pendencies are also considered to be in corre-
spondence.
3.3 Morpheme Similarity
A formula (3) defines the degree of similarity in
morpheme ?m between two sentences SA and
????????????? ??????????????
(Is there a Japanese restaurant near here?)

?m =
2CM
MA + MB
(3)
MA: the number of morphemes in SA
MB: the number of morphemes in SB
CM : the number of morphemes in correspon-
dence
In our research, if a word class is given to
nouns and proper nouns characteristic of a di-
alogue task and two morphemes belong to the
same class, these morphemes are also consid-
ered to be in correspondence. In order to ex-
tract the intention of the sentence more simi-
lar as the whole sentence, not only independent
words and keywords but also all the morphemes
such as noun and particle are used for the cal-
culation on correspondence.
3.4 Calculation Example
Figure 2 shows an example of the calculation
of the degree of similarity between an input ut-
terance Si ?kono chikaku-ni washoku-no mise
aru? (Is there a Japanese restaurant near
here?)? and an example sentence in a corpus,
Se, ?chikaku-ni yoshoku-no mise ari-masu-ka (Is
there a European restaurant located nearby?)?,
when a weight coefficient ? = 0.4. The num-
ber of the dependencies of Si and Se is 4 and
3, respectively, and that of dependencies in cor-
respondence is 2, i.e., (chikaku, aru) and (mise,
aru). Moreover, since ?washoku (Japanese-style
food)? and ?yoshoku? (European-style food)
belong to the same word class, the dependencies
(washoku, aru) and (yoshoku, aru) also corre-
spond with each other. Therefore, the degree
of similarity in dependency ?d comes to 0.86
by the formula (2). Since the number of mor-
phemes of Si and Se are 7 and 8, respectively,
and that of morphemes in correspondence is 6,
i.e., ?chikaku?, ?ni?, ?no?, ?mise?, ?aru(i)? and
?wa(yo)shoku?. Therefore, ?m comes to 0.80
by a formula (3). As mentioned above, ? us-
ing both morphemes and dependencies comes
to 0.82 by a formula (1).
4 Utilizing Context Information
In many cases, the intention of a user?s utter-
ance occurs in dependence on the intentions of
the previous utterances of the user or those of
the person to which the user is speaking. There-
fore, an input utterance might also receive the
influence in the contents of the speeches before
it. For example, the user usually returns the
answer to it after the system makes a question,
and furthermore, may ask the system a ques-
tion after its response. Then, in our technique,
the degree of similarity ?, which has been ex-
plained in Section 3, is weighted based on the
intentions of the utterances until it results in a
user?s utterance. That is, we consider the oc-
currence of a utterance intention In at a certain
time n to be dependent on the intentions of the
last N ? 1 utterances. Then, the conditional
occurrence probability P (In|I
n?1
n?N+1) is defined
as a formula (4).
P (In|I
n?1
n?N+1) =
C(Inn?N+1)
C(In?1n?N+1)
(4)
Here, we write a sequence of utterance in-
tentions In?N+1 ? ? ?In as Inn?N+1, call it in-
tentions N-gram, and write the number of
appearances of them in a dialogue corpus as
C(Inn?N+1). Moreover, we call the conditional
occurrence probability of the formula (4), in-
tentions N-gram probability.
The weight assignment based on the inten-
tions sequences is accomplished by reducing the
value of the degree of similarity when the in-
tentions N-gram probability is smaller than a
threshold. That is, a formula (5) defines the de-
gree of similarity ? using the weight assignment
by intentions N-gram probability.

A typical example of the effect of using inten-
tions N-gram is shown below. For an input ut-
terance ?chikaku-ni chushajo-wa ari-masu-ka?
(Is there a parking lot located nearby?)?, the
degree of similarity with a utterance with a
tag ?parking lot question? which intends to
ask whether a parking lot is located around
the searched store, and a utterance with a tag
?parking lot search? which intends to search a
parking lot located nearby, becomes the maxi-
mum. However, if the input utterance has oc-
curred after the response intending that there
is no parking lot around the store, the system
can recognize its intention not to be ?parking
lot question? from the intentions N-gram prob-
abilities learned from the corpus, As a result,
the system can arrive at a correct utterance in-
tention ?parking lot search?.
5 Evaluation
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we have made an experiment on ut-
terance intention inference.

Figure 4: Relation between the weight coeffi-

2001), was used as a corpus with intention tags,
and analyzed based on Japanese dependency
grammar (Matsubara et al, 2002). That is,
the intention tags were assigned manually into
all sentences in 412 dialogues about restaurant
search recorded on the corpus. The intentions
2-gram probability was learned from the sen-
tences of 174 dialogues in them. The standard
for assigning the intention tags was established
by extending the decision tree proposed as a di-
alogue tag scheme (JDRI, 2000). Consequently,
78 kinds of intention tags were prepared in all
(38 kinds are for driver utterances). The inten-
tion tag which should be given to each utter-
ance can be defined by following the extended
decision tree. A part of intention tags and the
sentence examples is shown in Table 1, and a
part of the decision tree for driver?s utterances
is done in Figure 3 1.
A word class database (Murao et al, 2001),
which has been constructed based on the cor-
pus, was used for calculating the rates of cor-
respondence in morphemes and dependencies.
Moreover, Chasen (Matsumoto et al, 99) was
used for the morphological analysis.
5.2 Experiment
5.2.1 Outline of Experiment
We have divided 1,609 driver?s utterances of
238 dialogues, which is not used for learning
the intentions 2-gram probability, into 10 pieces
equally, and evaluated by cross validation. That
is, the inference of the intentions of all 1,609 sen-

Figure 5: Relation between the weight coeffi-
cient ? and the accuracy
tences was performed, and the recall and preci-
sion were calculated. The experiments based on
the following four methods of calculating the de-
gree of similarity were made, and their results
were compared.
1. Calculation using only morphemes
2. Calculation using only denpendencies
3. Calculation using both morphemes and
denpendencies (With changing the value of
the weight coefficient ?)
4. Calculation using intentions 2-gram prob-
abilities in addition to the condition of 3.
(With changing the value of the weight co-
efficient ? and as ? = 0)
5.2.2 Experimental Result
The experimental result is shown in Figure 4.
63.7% as the recall and 48.2% as the precision
were obtained by the inference based on the
above method 1 (i.e. ? = 0), and 62.6% and
58.6% were done in the method 2 (i.e. ? = 1.0).
On the other hand , in the experiment on the
method 3, the precision became the maximum
by ? = 0.2, providing 61.0%, and the recall by
? = 0.3 was 67.2%. The result shows our tech-
nique of using both information on morphology
and dependency to be effective.
When ? ? 0.3, the precision of the method
3 became lower than that of 1. This is because
the user speaks with driving a car (Kawaguchi
et al, 2000) and therefore there are much com-
paratively short utterances in the in-car speech
corpus. Since there is a few dependencies per

Next, the experimental result of the inference
using weight assignment by intentions 2-gram
probabilities, when considering as ? = 0.3, is
shown in Figure 5. At ? = 0.8, the maximum
values in both precision and recall were provided
(i.e., the precision is 68.9%). This shows our
technique of learning the context information
from the spoken dialogue corpus to be effective.
6 In-car Spoken Dialogue System
In order to confirm our technique for automat-
ically inferring the intentions of the user?s ut-
terances to be feasible and effective for task-
oriented spoken dialogue processing, a proto-
type system for restaurant retrieval has been
developed. This section describes the outline of
the system and its evaluation.
6.1 Implementation of the System
The configuration of the system is shown in Fig-
ure 6.
Table 2: Comparison between the results on in-
ferred intentions and those on given intentions

Intentions num. rate num. rate

Partially corr. 5 8.3% 4 6.7%
Incorrect 7 11.7% 2 3.3%
No action 17 28.3% 12 20.0%
1. Morphological and dependency anal-
ysis: For the purpose of example-based
speech understanding, the morphological
and dependency analyses are given to each
user?s utterance by referring the dictionary
and parsing rules. Morphological analy-
sis is executed by Chasen (Matsumoto et
al., 99). Dependency parsing is done based
on a statistical approach (Matsubara et al,
2002).
2. Intentions inference: As section 3 and
4 explain, the intention of the user?s ut-
terance is inferred according to the degree
of similarity of it with each sentence in a
corpus, and the intentions 2-gram proba-
bilities.
3. Action: The transfer rules from the
user?s intentions to the system?s actions
have been made so that the system can
work as the user intends. We have al-
ready made the rules for all of 78 kinds
of intentions. The system decides the ac-
tions based on the rules, and executes
them. After that, it revises the context
stack. For example, if a user?s utterance
is ?kono chikaku-ni washoku-no mise ari-
masu-ka (Is there a Japanese restaurant
near here?)?, its intention is ?search?. In-
ferring it, the system retrieves the shop
information database by utilizing the key-
words such as ?washoku (Japanese restau-
rant)? and ?chikaku (near)?.
4. Response generation: The system re-
sponds based on templates which include
the name of shop, the number of shops, and
so on, as the slots.
6.2 Evaluation of the System
In order to confirm that by understanding the
user?s intention correctly the system can behave
appropriately, we have made an experiment on
the system. We used 1609 of driver?s utterances
in Section 5.2.1 as the learning data, and the
intentions 2-gram probabilities learned by 174
of dialogues in Section 5.1. Furthermore, 60 of
driver?s utterances which are not included in the
learning data were used for the test. We have
compared the results of the actions based on the
inferred intentions with those based on the given
correct intentions. The results have been classi-
fied into four groups: correct, partially correct,
incorrect, and no action.
The experimental result is shown in Table
2. The correct rate including partial correct-
ness provides 76.7% for the giving intentions
and 60.0% for the inferred intentions. We have
confirmed that the system could work appropri-
ately if correct intentions are inferred.
The causes that the system based on given
intentions did not behave appropriately for 14
utterances, have been investigated. 6 utterances
are due to the failure of keywords processing,
and 8 utterances are due to that they are out of
the system?s expectation. It is expected for the
improvement of the transfer rules to be effective
for the former. For the latter, it is considered
to turn the responses such as ?I cannot answer
the question. If the questions are about ? ? ?, I
can do that.?
7 Concluding Remarks
This paper has proposed the example-based
method for inferring speaker?s intention. The
intention of each input utterance is regarded as
that of the most similar utterance in the cor-
pus. The degree of similarity is calculated based
on the degrees of correspondence in both mor-
phemes and dependencies, taking account of the
effects of a sequence of the previous utterance?s
intentions. The experimental result using 1,609
driver?s utterances of CIAIR in-car speech cor-
pus has shown the feasibility of example-based
speech intention understanding. Furthermore,
we have developed a prototype system of in-car
spoken dialogue processing for a restaurant re-
trieval task based on our method.

By statistically dealing with the corpus,
the automatic acquisition of dialogue-
structural rules is achieved. The di-
alogue structure is expressed as a bi-
nary tree and 789 dialogues consist-
ing of 8150 utterances in the CIAIR
speech corpus are annotated. To eval-
uate the scalability of the corpus for
creating dialogue-structural rules, a di-
alogue parsing experiment was con-
ducted.
1 Introduction
With the improvement of speech processing tech-
nologies, spoken dialogue systems that appropri-
ately respond to a user?s spontaneous utterances
and cooperatively execute a dialogue are desired.
It is important for cooperative spoken dialogue
systems to understand the intentions of a user?s
utterances, the purpose of the dialogue, and its
achievement state (Litman, 1990). To solve this
issue, several approaches have been so far pro-
posed. One of them is an approach in which the
system expresses the knowledge of the dialogue
with a frame and executes the dialogue accord-
ing to that frame (Goddeau, 1996; Niimi, 2001;
Oku, 2004). However, it is difficult to make a
frame that totally defines the content of the dia-
logue. Additionally, there is a tendency for the
dialogue style to be greatly affected by the frame.

In this paper, we describe the construction of
a structurally annotated spoken dialogue corpus.
By statistically dealing with the corpus, we can
achieve the automatic acquisition of dialogue-
structural rules. We suppose that the system can
figure out the state of the dialogue through the in-
cremental building of the dialogue structure.
We use the CIAIR in-car spoken dialogue cor-
pus (Kawaguchi, 2004; Kawaguchi, 2005), and
describe the dialogue structure as a binary tree.
The tree expresses the purpose of partial dia-
logues and the relations between utterances or
partial dialogues. The speaker?s intention tags
were provided in the transcription of the corpus.
We annotated 789 dialogues consisting of 8150
utterances. Due to the advantages of the dialogue-

Abstract
This paper proposes a new framework for
a spoken dialogue system based on dia-
logue examples between human subjects
and the Wizard of OZ (WOZ) system. Us-
ing this framework and a model of infor-
mation retrieval dialogue, a spoken dia-
logue system for retrieving shop informa-
tion while driving in a car has been de-
signed. The system refers to the dialogue
examples to find an example that is suit-
able for generating a query or a reply. The
authors have also constructed a large-scale
dialogue database using a WOZ system,
which enables efficient collection of dia-
logue examples.
1 Introduction
Against the background of ever-increasing comput-
ing power, techniques for constructing spoken di-
alogue systems using large-scale speech and text
corpora have become the target of much research
(Levin et al, 1998; Young, 2002). In prior re-
search, the authors have proposed a spoken-dialogue
control technique using dialogue examples with the
aim of performing flexible dialogue control dur-
ing information-retrieval dialogue and of achieving
speech understanding robust against speech recog-
nition errors (Murao et al, 2001). This technique
uses input speech data and supplementary informa-
tion corresponding to input speech such as retrieval
formulas (queries) to form ?examples? that decide
system action. A system using this technique can-
not run effectively, however, without a large volume
of example data. Traditionally, though, collecting
human-to-human dialogue data and manually pro-
viding such supplementary information for each in-
stance of input speech has required considerable la-
bor.
In this paper, we address this problem and pro-
pose a new technique for constructing an example-
based dialogue system using, as example data, the
dialogue performed between a human subject and a
pseudo-spoken-dialogue system based on the Wiz-
ard of OZ (WOZ) scheme. We also describe a
specific spoken dialogue system for information re-
trieval that we constructed using this technique.
2 Dialogue Processing Based on Examples
We first provide an overview of example-based dia-
logue processing that we previously proposed (Mu-
rao et al, 2001).
2.1 Model of information retrieval dialogue
Given a scenario in which a human operator
searches an information database and returns infor-
mation to a user, dialog between the operator and
user can be modeled as shown in Fig. 1. The ele-
ments of this model are described below.
1. Request The user tells the operator the con-
tents of an inquiry and demands reference.
2. Retrieval The operator receiving the user?s re-
quest generates a query after referencing do-
main knowledge and current dialogue context

and then processes the query indirectly by ma-
nipulating a search tool such as an ordinary
computer.
3. Search results The search tool generates
search results.
4. Reply The operator returns a reply to the user
based on search results and dialogue context.
Setting up information flow in this way allows
us to view operator behavior in the following way.
Specifically, the operator in Fig. 1 makes two deci-
sions in the process of advancing dialog.
Decision 1: Generate a query after listening to user
speech
Decision 2: Generate a reply after receiving search
results
Here, an experienced operator would use more
than just the superficial information obtained from
user speech. To generate a query or reply that
best suits the user?s need at that time, the opera-
tor would also make use of domain knowledge, di-
alogue context, and the search results themselves.
In other words, this kind of dialogue processing can
be viewed as a mapping operation from input infor-
mation such as user speech and domain knowledge
to output information such as a query. With this in
mind, we considered whether a ?decision? to guide
such dialogue could be automatically performed by
referring to actual examples of behavior manifested
by an experienced human operator. In short, we de-
cided to store a large volume of dialogue examples,
i.e., mapping information, and to determine output
information for certain input information on the ba-
sis of mapping information stored in similar dia-
logue examples.
2.2 Generation of queries and replies based on
examples
2.2.1 Structure of example data
The two ?decisions? performed during the time of
information retrieval dialogue between the user and
operator can be expressed as a mapping between the
following input and output information.
? Input/output information in the decision for
generating a query:
Input User speech and dialogue context
Output Query
? Input/output information in the decision for
generating a reply:
Input User speech, dialogue context, and
search results
Output Reply
It is therefore sufficient to save those items that
cover such input and output information. Specifi-
cally, a large number of example data can be col-
lected using the following information as elements
to construct an example database.
1. Text of user speech
2. Query
3. Reply text
4. Search results
5. Dialogue context (past speech, grounding in-
formation, conversational objects , etc.)
The following describes the procedure for gener-
ating a query or reply with respect to input speech
by referencing an example database.
2.2.2 Query generation process
From among the examples in the example
database, the system extracts the one most similar
to the input speech and the dialogue context at that
time. It then adjusts the query in that example to fit
the input speech and generates a new query.
2.2.3 Reply generation process
The system performs a search based on the gen-
erated query and receives search results. It then ex-
tracts the most similar example from the example
database with respect to input speech, the dialogue
context at that time, and the search results. Finally,
the system adjusts the reply in that example to fit the
current conditions and generates a new reply.
2.3 Problem points
Operating a dialogue system based on dialogue
examples requires the construction of an example
database as described above. Constructing a large-
scale example database, moreover, requires a large
volume of dialogue text in which supplementary in-
formation such as queries and search results has
been provided with respect to input speech.
Up to now, we have been constructing an exam-
ple database by first collecting human-to-human di-
alogue and converting speech to text and then as-
signing queries, search results, and the like to each
instance of input speech. This, however, is a labori-
ous process. In addition, example data constructed
on the basis of human-to-human dialogue data may
have features different from those of human-to-
dialogue-system dialogue data. In other words, we
cannot call the above approach an optimal method
for constructing example data.
3 Construction of an Example Database
using the WOZ System
We propose the Wizard of OZ (WOZ) system as
one means of efficiently collecting dialogue data
that includes supplementary information attached to
speech. Carrying on a dialogue using WOZ makes
it possible to collect the information needed for
constructing an example database while collecting
speech data.
3.1 WOZ system
When carrying on a dialogue using the WOZ sys-
tem, the user feels that he or she is talking to a com-
pletely mechanical system despite the fact that a hu-
man being is actually being used for some of the
elements making up the dialogue system. Collect-
ing dialogue data by WOZ should therefore result in

data that is closer to dialogue that would occur be-
tween a human and a machine.
Collecting spoken dialogue data using the WOZ
system has actually been performed a number of
times in the past (MADCOW, 1992; Bertenstam et
al., 1995; Life et al, 1996; Eskenazi et al, 1999;
San-Segundo et al, 2001; Lemmela and Boda, 2002;
Yoma et al, 2002). The objective of those stud-
ies, however, was to collect, analyze, and evaluate
dialogue data between people and artificial objects,
and in many cases, only one of the artificial-object?s
functions was taken over by a human, for example,
the speech recognition function.
Our study, however, goes further than the above.
In particular, we create special software (called
WOZ software) that allows a human being to per-
form the functions of interpreting user speech, gen-
erating queries and executing searches, and generat-
ing replies. We then propose a framework that en-
ables the operator (wizard) to carry on a dialogue
with the user while operating this WOZ software so
that obtained data can be used later to perform di-
rect control of a dialogue system. Specifically, we
configure a pseudo-spoken-dialogue system (WOZ)
consisting of WOZ software and an operator, hold
information retrieval dialogue between this system
and human subjects, and save the queries ,search re-
sults and reply statements generated at this time as
log information. We then use this log information
and text-converted speech to construct an example
database that can be used for dialogue control.

Figure 4: An example of display of Wizard of OZ system (2): Reply generation part
the WOZ software, which was created using the
C++ language, runs on a personal computer under
Windows2000. It consists of a screen for generat-
ing queries (query part) and a screen for generating
replies (reply part). Figures 3 and 4 show sample
screens of these parts. This GUI adopts a touch-
panel system to facilitate operations ? an operator
only has to touch a button on one of these screens
to generate a query, search an information database,
generate a reply, or output synthesized speech.
WOZ software must feature high operability to
achieve natural dialogue between the WOZ system
and a human user. When designing WOZ software
on the basis of a human-to-human dialogue corpus
that we previously collected, we used the following
techniques to enable the system to operate in real
time while carrying on a dialogue with the user.
First, the query part arranges keywords in a tree
structure by search type so that appropriate key-
words can be selected at a touch to generate a query
and retrieve information quickly 1 . Search results
are displayed at the bottom of the screen in list form.
Second, the reply part displays text-input buttons
for generating replies and a list of search results.
The text-input buttons correspond to words, phrases,
and short standard sentences, and pushing them in
1Queries that deal with context in regard to input speech are
currently not defined for the sake of simplicity in software op-
eration.
?Hungry, but not enough time.
?You want to eat Chineese noodle.
?Search Japanese food restaurant.
Figure 5: Examples of prompting panels
an appropriate order generates a reply in text form.
The arrangement of these text-input buttons on the
screen is based on connection frequency between
text elements (reply-statement bigram) as previously
determined from the human-to-human dialogue cor-
pus mentioned above. In other words, each text-
input button represents a text entry having the high-
est frequency of following the immediately previous
text entry to the left, which makes for quick genera-
tion of a reply. Furthermore, to enable quick input,
the section of the screen displaying the search results
has been designed so that the name portion of each
result can be touched directly and automatically in-
cluded in the reply. The generated reply in text form
is finally output in voice form via the speech synthe-
sis section of the system.
Switching back and forth between the query and
reply parts can be performed as needed using a
switch button. The reply part also includes but-
tons for instantly generating words and short phrases
of confirmation and encouragement (e.g., ?yes,? ?I
see?) while the user is speaking to create as natural
a dialogue as possible.
3.3 Collecting dialogue data by the WOZ
system
We targeted shop-information retrieval while driv-
ing a car as an information-retrieval application
based on spoken dialogue, and collected dialogue
data between the WOZ system and human subjects
(Kawaguchi et al, 2002). This data was collected
within an automobile driven by subjects each of
whom acted as a user searching for information. A
personal computer running the WOZ software was
placed in the automobile with the ?wizard? sitting
in the back seat. All spoken dialogue was recorded
using another personal computer.
Data collection was performed according to the
following procedure for a duration of about five min-
Table 1: Collected WOZ data

utes per subject.
? A prompting panel such as shown in Fig. 5 is
presented to the subject.
? The subject converses freely with WOZ based
on the prompting panel shown.
The wizard operates the WOZ system while lis-
tening to the subject, that is, the wizard performs an
appropriate search and returns a reply using speech
synthesis 2 .
Table 1 shows the scale of collected data.
3.4 Constructing an example database using
WOZ log information
WOZ software was designed to output detailed log
information. This information consists mainly of
the following items. All log information is recorded
with time stamps.
? Speaker ID (input by the wizard when initiating
a dialogue)
? Query generated for the input speech in ques-
tion
? Search results returned for the generated query
(number of hits and shop IDs)
? Text of reply generated by the operator (wiz-
ard)
A saved WOZ log can be used to efficiently con-
struct an example database by the following proce-
dure. To begin with, a written record of user speech
is made based on the voice recording of spoken di-
alog with time information added. Next, based on
2The wizard generates queries, performs searches, and gen-
erates replies to the extent possible for speech to which defined
queries can be applied. If a query cannot be generated, the wiz-
ard will not keep trying and will generate only an appropriate
response.

We constructed an example database using a por-
tion of dialogue data collected in the above manner.
Table 2 summarizes the data used for this purpose.
Query and search-result correspondences were es-
tablished for about 20% of all user speech excluding
speech outside of the task in question and speech
outside of query specifications.
4 Spoken Dialogue System using Dialogue
Examples
We here describe a dialogue system that runs using
the example database that we constructed (see (Mu-
rao et al, 2001) for details). The task is to search for
shop information while inside an automobile. This
system was implemented using the C++ language
under Windows2000. Figure 6 shows a screen shot
of this example-based dialogue system.
4.1 System configuration
The following describes the components of this sys-
tem with reference to Fig. 7.
Dialogue example database (DEDB): Consists of
data constructed from dialogue text and log in-
formation output from WOZ software. Dia-
logue text is subjected to morphological anal-
ysis 3, and words essential to advancing the di-
alogue (e.g., shop name, facility name, food
name) are assigned word class tags based on
classes given to these words beforehand ac-
cording to meaning.
Word Class Database (WCDB): Consists of
words essential to the task in question and
classes given to them according to meaning.
Word classes are determined empirically based
on dialogue within the dialogue corpus.
Shop Information Database (SIDB): Consists of
a collection of information on about 800 restau-
rants and shops in Nagoya, the same as that
used in the WOZ system.
Speech Recognition: Uses ?Japanese Dictation
Toolkit(Kawahara et al, 2000)?. The lan-
guage model was created from the previously
collected human-to-human dialogue corpus.

4.2 Operation
The following describes system operation (see Fig.
8 for a specific operation example).
Step 1: Extracting similar example for query
For a speech recognition result, the system
extracts the most similar example from the
DEDB. The robustness of the similarity cal-
culation between the input utterance and the
utterance in the DEDB should be considered
against the speech recognition error. Therefore,
a keyword matching method using the word
class information is adopted. For a speech
recognition result combined with a morpholog-
ical analysis result, independent words and the
Input:   Etto, spaghetti no omise ni ikitai na.
            (I'd like to go to a spaghetti restaurant.)

 1st:  U: <10:Curry> no [omise] ni [iki]tain desu kedo

Figure 8: Example of query and reply generation
important words to which the word class tags
are assigned according to the information in
the WCDB are regarded as the keywords, and
their similarity is calculated as follows. For
each transcription of a user?s utterances in the
DEDB, the number of matched words and the
number of important words which belong to
the same word class are accumulated with the
correspondent weight and the result is treated
as the similarity. The utterance which marks
the highest similarity is regarded as the most
similar one.
Step2: Query Modification The query for the ex-
tracted example is modified with reference to
the input utterance. The modification is per-
formed by replacing the keywords in the refer-
ence query using word class information.
Step 3: Search The SIDB is searched by using the
modified query and a search result is obtained.
Step 4: Extracting similar example for reply
The system extracts the most similar example
from the DEDB, by taking account of not only
the similarity between the input utterance and
the utterance in examples but also that between
the number of items in the search result and
that in the examples. Here, a total similarity
score is computed by performing a weighted
summation of two values: the utterance sim-
ilarity score and the search-results similarity
score obtained from the difference between
the number of search results in an example
and that obtained in Step 3. The search-results
similarity score is computed as follows.
When the number of search results by mod-
ified query is 0: Give the highest score to
examples in the example database with 0 num-
ber of search results and the lowest score to all
other examples.
When the number of search results by mod-
ified query is 1 or more: Give the high-
est score to examples in the example database
with the same number of search results and an
increasingly lower score as difference in the
number of search results becomes larger (use
heuristics).
For example, if not even one search result could
be obtained by the modified query, examples in
the example database with not even one search
result constitute a match.
Step 5: Reply Modification The reply statement
for the extracted example is modified with ref-
erence to the input utterance. The modification
is performed by replacing the words in the ref-
erence reply statement by using word class in-
formation. Then a speech synthesis module is
used to produce a reply speech.
4.3 Adding, modification, and deletion of
example data
This system allows example data to be added, mod-
ified, and deleted. When a failed operation occurs
while carrying on a dialogue, for example, buttons
located at the bottom of the screen can be used to
modify existing example data, add new examples,
and delete unnecessary examples.
5 Conclusion
This paper has proposed an efficient technique for
collecting example data using the Wizard of OZ
(WOZ) system for the purpose of guiding spoken di-
alogue using dialogue examples. This technique has
the following effects.
? Knowledge buried in the WOZ system log
(conversions from input speech to query and
reply, etc.) can be used as dialogue system
knowledge.
? Because dialogue is collected using the WOZ
system, the examples so collected are close to
dialogue that would occur in an environment
with an actual dialogue system. In other words,
dialogue examples can be collected under con-
ditions close to human-to-machine dialogue.
? The labor involved in recording speech neces-
sary for construction of an example database
can be reduced.
In future research, we plan to evaluate dialogue-
processing performance and context processing us-
ing example databases constructed with the WOZ
