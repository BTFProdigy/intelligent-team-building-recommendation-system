Abstract
In this paper we explain how we anno-
tated subordinators in the Turkish Dis-
course Bank (TDB), an effort that started
in 2007 and is still continuing. We in-
troduce the project and describe some of
the issues that were important in anno-
tating three subordinators, namely kars??n,
rag?men and halde, all of which encode the
coherence relation Contrast-Concession.
We also describe the annotation tool.
1 Introduction
The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a project
initiated by the joint effort of a group of re-
searchers in Turkey. The project builds on an ex-
isting corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus
(MTC) (Say et al, 2002), and extends it to a dis-
course level resource by following the principles
of the PDTB (Prasad et al, 2007) in annotating
discourse connectives and their arguments. The 2-
million-word MTC contains 520 continuous texts
from various genres written between 1991-2000.
From a semantic perspective, we take discourse
connectives as predicates that take as their argu-
ments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract ob-
ject interpretations. Abstract objects are proposi-
tions, facts, events, situations, etc. (Asher, 1993).
Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly
or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al, 2007).
Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexi-
cal items that encode a discourse relation, while
implicit connectives can be inferred from related
text spans that have coherence relations. The TDB
project aims to annotate explicit connectives only.
In Turkish, discourse connectives are identified
with three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Web-
ber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Sub-
ordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric
0Corresponding author: dezeyrek@metu.edu.tr
connectives). All these discourse connectives have
two and only two arguments, which are conve-
niently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.1 ARG2 is
always the argument that syntactically hosts the
connective.
The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourse
connectives is consistent with the following ob-
servations in discourse: Sentences in discourse
are coherently related, and therefore when ex-
plicit discourse connectives are used, if they are
really discourse connectives, they are bound to
set up a relation between a consequent clause and
its antecedent. (Note that the ARG2 designation
does not imply that ARG2 is consequent or an-
tecedent.) In certain cases presupposition needs a
mediator, viz. the discourse connective. Noncon-
nectival discourse relations are certainly possible,
but connective-engendered discourse relations are
claimed to be more specific about their semantics,
e.g. they bring about presuppositional meaning
(van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al, 1999).
In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification is
unlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lex-
ical property of functors (e.g. verbs) which are
not necessarily presuppositional and hence they
can differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive,
unergative, unaccusative etc.).
2 The Data
The MTC is preprocessed to obtain the raw texts
keeping the title, author, publishing date and the
text type information at the beginning of each file.
Stand-off annotation is done on the textual render-
ing of the MTC.
To enable the data to be viewable universally
without losing any character information, the file
format (originally xcs) was converted to text, and
the character encoding (originally Turkish-ISO-
1Whether or not discourse connectives in any language
take more than two arguments is an open question that needs
to be established in further research.

processed MTC data were divided into four sub-
corpora by keeping the text type distribution, file
count and word count as equal as possible in each
subcorpus. The text type distribution, file count
and word percentage information in each subcor-
pus are given in Table 1. In the project, we plan to
annotate subcorpus 1.
3 Subordinating Conjunctions in
Turkish: A Brief Overview
Subordinators have two subtypes. Converbs are
suffixes attached directly to verb roots. For exam-
ple, the suffix -(y)ArAk ?by (means of)? requires
as its ARG2 a nominalized adverbial clause as in
(1). Complex subordinators, e.g. rag?men ?despite,
although?, kars??n ?although?, halde ?despite, along
with?, ic?in causal ?since?, purposive ?so as to?, etc.
mostly take case-marked nominalized clauses as
their ARG2.
(1) Hu?ku?met ... uyum paketini onaylayarak ...
Erdog?an?n o?nu?ndeki engellerden birini kald?rd?.
By approving the adaptation package ..., the
government alleviated one of the obstacles for
Erdog?an ...
In this paper, we will not deal with converbs.
We will also not deal with connectives taking as
their ARG2 a finite clause because none of these
subtypes have been annotated yet. We will focus
on three postpositions taking a nominalized clause
as ARG2, namely rag?men, kars??n and halde, all of
which encode the Contrast-Concession relation.
In the PDTB, such clauses were not annotated as
arguments. However, in Turkish, they are so com-
mon as arguments of subordinators that we would
have missed an important property of Turkish dis-
course if we did not annotate them. In the rest
of the paper, we provide examples taken from the
MTC. We underline the connective, show ARG2
in bold letters and render ARG1 in italics.
3.1 The minimality principle
As in the PDTB, the minimality principle is in-
voked, according to which clauses, parts of clauses
or sentences that are minimally necessary and suf-
ficient for the discourse relation engendered by
the connective are annotated as ARG1 or ARG2
(Prasad et al, 2007). Any other text span that
is perceived to be important for the interpretation
of the discourse relation can be selected as sup-
plementary information in addition to ARG1 or
ARG2.
3.2 Morphological properties of the
arguments and their relative ordering
In Turkish, subordinate clauses are essentially
nominalizations, which may be formed by -DIK
or -mA suffixes (the factive nominal and the action
nominal, respectively (Kornfilt, 1997)).
Two of the connectives, i.e. rag?men and kars??n
expect action nominals, the person agreement suf-
fix, and the dative suffix -(y)A on their ARG2. On
the other hand, the connective halde expects a fac-
tive nominal and the person agreement suffix. In
the examples below, we show these suffixes with
glosses on the English translations.
The arguments of subordinators are necessarily
adjacent and mostly exhibit the ARG2-ARG1 or-
der because Turkish is a left-branching language
and subordinate clauses are on the left in canonical
order. ARG2 can be postposed for backgrounding
purposes or to express new and unexpected infor-
mation, as in (2).
(2) ... ayn? annesine oldu]ugu gibi ona da, kimseye
ba/uglanmayanlar kolayca bag?lan?yordu; u?stelik o
o?yle bir bag??ml?l?k talep etmedig?i halde.
... just as it happened to her mother, people who
can?t easily commit themselves to anyone would
45
easily commit themselves to her, although she
would not ask-FACTN-AGR for such a commit-
ment.
3.3 Issues in annotating the arguments
One of the challenges we have faced so far is the
question of how to annotate connectives which are
themselves a converb suffix (e.g. -(y)ArAk, as in
(1)) or postpositions that choose a case-marked
ARG2 as in (2). In both cases, we decided to an-
notate ARG2 by selecting the clause without sepa-
rating the suffixes. In this way, we would not inter-
fere with the annotators? intuitions since we would
not be demanding them to have conscious knowl-
edge of the morphological constraints on the ar-
guments. This style of annotation was welcomed
by the annotators. When all the annotations are
completed, we plan to separate the suffixes with a
morphological parser to provide a full view of the
morphology of the arguments.
Another issue was how to annotate shared sub-
jects in subordinate clauses. Turkish allows sub-
ject pro-drop and in complex sentences, the shared
subject is shown by the person agreement suffix
on the verb of the consequent clause. To capture
this fact, we chose to exclude shared subjects from
the annotation of the arguments. This style of
annotation conforms to the minimality principle.
As illustrated in (3), the subject, Neriman, which
appears in its canonical clause-initial position in
ARG2 is not selected because the verb of the sub-
sequent clause carries the person agreement suffix.
(3) Neriman yatak odas?nda sigara ic?ilmesini is-
temedig?i halde s?imdilik sigaraya ses c??karm?yor.
Although Neriman does not want-FACTN-AGR
people to smoke in her bedroom, (she) doesn?t
say-AGR anything for the moment.2
If the subject is not shared, it is included in the
annotation, even if it causes discontinuity. As it
is illustrated in (4), ARG2 intervenes in ARG1 by
separating it from its subject.
(4) Rukiye, kendisinden u?c? yas? ufak olmas?na
rag?men, erkek kardes?ini kendi og?lu san?yordu, ...
Rukiye, although (he) is-ACTN-AGR-DAT three
years younger than herself, thought-AGR that her
brother was her son...
2The pronoun is in parentheses to reflect pro-drop. The
following abbreviations are used on the translations to show
the morphological characteristics of the clauses: ACTN: Ac-
tion nominal, FACTN: Factive nominal, AGR: Person agree-
ment suffix, DAT: Dative case, ABL: Ablative case. NOM:
Nominative case.
Example (5) shows that two nominalized
clauses can be selected as the arguments of the
subordinator kars??n leaving out the shared sub-
ject. In this example, the subject is shown between
square brackets for clarity. Note that, ARG1 is
also a nominalized clause since it is embedded un-
der the attribution verb so?yle - ?say?.3
(5) ... [herkes yarat?lan toplumsal deg?erden verdig?i
emek oran?nda pay alacak bic?imindeki sosyalist
iktisat ilkesinin] asl?nda c?ok es?itlikc?i gibi
go?zu?kmesine kars??n es?itsizlig?i engelleye-
meyeceg?ini, ... so?yler
... says that ... despite (it) looks-ACTN-AGR-
DAT quite egalitarian, [the socialist principle,
stating that everyone gets a share proportional to
his labor] will not prevent-ACTN-AGR inequality
...
Finally, in annotating adjuncts, we follow the
same principle we followed in annotating shared
subjects. For instance in (6), the adjunct yemekte
?at dinner? is not annotated since it is shared by the
arguments of the connective rag?men.
(6) Gu?l de yemekte kilo ald?rmas?na rag?men S?am
tatl?lar?ndan c?ok hos?land?g??n? ifade etti.
At dinner, Gu?l-NOM, also said that although
(theyi) are-ACTN-AGR-DAT fattening, (he)
likes Damascus deserts-ABLi very much.
4 The Annotation Process
Before the annotation procedure started, a set of
annotation guidelines were prepared. The guide-
lines include the basic principles, such as what
discourse connectives are, where in the discourse
one can find ARG1 and ARG2, how to annotate
shared subjects, adjuncts, etc. Rather than being
strict rules, the guidelines are aimed at being gen-
eral principles guiding the annotators in their de-
cision of selecting the text span that is minimally
sufficient for interpreting the discourse relation en-
coded by the connective.
The annotation cycle consisted of 1) annotat-
ing a connective by at least three different people
2) measuring the agreement among them with the
inter-anotator agreement tool 3) resolving the dis-
agreements with an anonymous decision.
4.1 The annotation tool
We have an XML-based infrastructure for annota-
tion. It aims to produce searchable and trackable
data. Stand-off annotation has well-known advan-
tages such as the ability to see layers separately, or
3In the PDTB, attribution is not taken as a discourse re-
lation but it is annotated. Attribution is not annotated in the
TDB.

with the agreed/gold standard annotations. For halde, 2 annotators performed a common annotation (given as Annotator1) and

to distribute annotation without data due to licens-
ing constraints. To this list we can add the em-
pirical necessity that, the crossing links in a single
layer of same kind of annotation might not be easy
to do inline. They can be done inline using SGML
OCCURS checks, but they are easier to annotate
in stand-off mode.
The tool has a regular expression mode in which
the annotator can use his/her knowledge of Turk-
ish word structure to collect similarly inflected
words without morphological analysis. For exam-
ple, -ArAk$, in which the uppercase forms repre-
sent metaphonemes, will bring words ending with
the allomorphs of the converb suffix due to vowel
harmony: erek, arak etc.
5 Conclusion
The TDB project is a first attempt in creating an
annotated resource for written Turkish discourse.
The annotation process is still continuing. In this
paper, the emphasis was on a small number of con-
nectives, namely three postpositions, which form a
subclass of subordinators. The paper described the
role of certain morpho-syntactic facts in interpret-
ing the coherence relation between two clauses,
and how these facts were reflected in the annota-
tions.
Three subjects separately annotated each of the
subordinators on the annotation tool, and inter-
rater reliability was calculated. The statistics were
obtained from Cochran?s Q test to the ARG1 and
ARG2 spans. The annotation data were encoded
with 1 if the character is in the span and 0 if it
is not. The encoded data were put to the Q test.
All the results were above the minimum success
probability (>0.05), showing that the annotations
were consistent (see Table 2). We will run another
Cochran experiment in which we will test whether
the annotators agree on ARG1/ARG2 boundaries,
rather than just word inclusion in the text spans as
above.
Given the distribution of agreements, Cochran
provides the number of subjects who must agree
so that a text span can be reliably considered an
ARG1 or ARG2. This we believe is important to
report with the final product (to be made public
soon), so that its gold standard can be assessed by
the community.

The Annotation Scheme of the Turkish Discourse Bank and An  Evaluation of Inconsistent Annotations  Deniz Zeyrek, I??n Demir?ahin, Ay????? Sevdik-?all?, Hale ?gel Balaban,  ?hsan Yal??nkaya Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey and   ?mit Deniz Turan Anadolu University, Eski?ehir, Turkey  Corresponding author: dezeyrek@metu.edu.tr  Abstract  In this paper, we report on the annotation procedures we developed for annotating the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), an effort that extends the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) annotation style by using it for annotating Turkish discourse. After a brief introduction to the TDB, we describe the annotation cycle and the annotation scheme we developed, defining which parts of the scheme are an extension of the PDTB and which parts are different. We provide inter-coder reliability calculations on the first and second arguments of some connectives and discuss the most important sources of disagreement among annotators.   1 A brief introduction to the Turkish Discourse Bank 1.1 The Data The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) project aims to annotate the 500,000-word-subcorpus of the two-million-word METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al 2002). The subcorpus includes a wide range of texts, e.g. fiction, interviews, memoirs, news articles, etc. reflecting the distribution of the genres in the MTC (Zeyrek et al 2009). The main objective of the project is to annotate discourse connectives with their two arguments, modifiers and supplementary text spans. Following the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB), we take discourse connectives as discourse-level predicates taking two (and only 
two) arguments, called Arg1 and Arg2, which may span one or more clauses and sentences that are adjacent or nonadjacent to the connective (Prasad et al 2007, Webber, 2004). Discourse relations can certainly be expressed without connectives but we have chosen to annotate discourse relations encoded by connectives since they are more specific about their semantics.  Discourse connectives are identifiable from three syntactic classes, namely, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials. As in the PDTB, we take elements belonging to these syntactic classes as discourse connectives when they semantically relate syntactic entitities such as clauses, sentences, sequences of sentences, and nominalizations having an abstract object interpretation i.e., eventualities, possibilities, situations, facts, and propositions (as in Asher, 1993, cf. Webber, et al 2005). Major departures from the PDTB are, attribution is not annotated, only overt connectives are being annotated, and the nominal arguments of connectives are being annotated where they denote an abstract object. Annotation of implicit connectives is further work.  1.2 The annotation cycle Before the annotation process started, the annotators studied the guidelines, which defined some general principles and illustrated difficult cases. The guidelines were written in a way to allow the annotators enough freedom to reflect their intuitions on the annotations. The annotators were also told to observe the minimality principle (MP) of the PDTB guidelines, which expects them to mark as argument parts of a clause or sentence that are 
282
minimally sufficient and necessary for the discourse relation encoded by the connective. The annotation cycle includes three steps. First, the annotators go through the whole subcorpus to annotate a given connective at a time. Any disagreements are discussed and resolved by the project team. In the second step, the definitions in the annotation guidelines are revised with the new issues that emerged in annotating the connective. Finally, the agreed annotations are checked to ensure they obeyed the annotation guidelines fully. The annotations were created by a tool designed by Akta? (2008).  The connectives are being annotated for the categories given in the next section by three annotators, who have been in the project since the annotation effort started. The three-step annotation process and the number of annotators we use slow down the task considerably but given the complexity of discourse annotation and the need for annotation efforts in Turkish, we were compelled to target maximum reliability achieved by three annotators.  The inter-coder reliability has recently stabilized and to speed the annotation effort, two annotators have started to carry out their task as a pair, while the other annotator works independently. This annotation style involves two annotators working side-by-side at one computer, continuously collaborating on one connective type at a time to code all its tokens in the subcorpus. One of the annotators carries out the task on the annotation tool, while the other observes her continuously for any defects and problems and suggests alternative solutions. This style of annotation, created by our group independently of pair programming, corresponds to the practice explained in Williams, et al(2000) and Williams and Kessler (2000). It is quite a beneficial and reliable method that also speeds up the process (Demir?ahin, et alms). 1 We give the preliminary results of this procedure in section 2.1.4.  1.3 An outline of Turkish connectives and the annotation scheme We annotate discourse connectives belonging to the syntactic classes listed below, leaving out converbs that may function as discourse connectives.                                                    1 Except for ve ?and?, the statistics reported in this paper reflect the agreement among 3 independent annotators. 
? Coordinating conjunctions (ve ?and?, ya da ?or?, ama ?but?) ? Complex subordinators (i?in ?for?, ra?men ?although, despite?), converbs/simplex subordinators (-Ince ?when,? ?ken ?while, now that?)2 ? Anophoric connectives (bundan ba?ka ?in addition to/separate from these?, bunun sonucunda ?as a result of this,? bunun i?in ?due to/for this reason?, buna ra?men ?despite this?) and discourse adverbials (oysa ?however?, ?te yandan ?on the other hand?, then ?sonradan?) In Turkish, coordinators are typically s(entence)-medial, they may also be found s-initially, or s-finally. Coordinators show an affinity with the second clause, as evidenced by punctuation and their ability to move to the end of the second clause. Subordinators take as their second argument a nonfinite clause that contains a genitive marked subject that agrees with the subordinate verb in terms of person and number.  The subordinate clause may also be assigned case by the postposition that functions as the connective. The subordinator and its host clause are always adjacent and the subordinate clause may appear s-initially or s-finally. Anaphoric connectives are characterized by an anaphoric element in the phrase and hence they have the ability to access the inference in the prior discourse (Webber, et al2003). Furthermore, they may take as their first argument text spans that are nonadjacent to the sentence containing the connective (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008).3  As example (1) illustrates, discourse adverbials can be used with connectives from other syntactic classes, e.g. a coordinating conjunction, fakat ?but? may be used with sonradan ?then?, and in accessing its first argument, the discourse adverbial may cross one or more clauses. In the examples, Arg1 is italicized, Arg2 set in bold, and the connective head is underlined.                                                   2 The capital letters are used to capture the cases where a vowel agrees with the vowel harmony rules of the language. The vowel rendered by the capital letter I may be resolved as any of the high vowels in the language, i.e., i, ?, ?, u.  3In the PDTB, expressions like after that are coded as ?alternative lexicalization? while coding implicit connectives, i.e., as a ?nonconnective expression? (Prasad et al 2007:22).  In Turkish, such phrasal expressions are abundant. They are two-part expressions with one part referring to the relation, the other anaphorically to Arg1 as in English. We decided to take these expressions as connectives because otherwise, we would be missing an important fact about Turkish. Therefore they are being annotated as connectives in the TDB project.

(1) a. Bunlar? a??klad???m?z vakit y?neticiler evvela ?a??rd?lar  When (we) explained these, the administrators were first surprised. b. B?yle bir ?eyi asla beklemiyorlard?.     (They) were never expecting such a thing. c. Fakat sonradan kendilerini toparlad?lar.  But then they gained their composure.  Largely following the annotation style of the PDTB, we determined the categories that form the annotation of a relation as follows:  Conn: This is the connective head of an explicit connective. Arg2: This tag refers to the argument that forms a syntactic unit with the connective.  Arg1: This tag is for the other argument that the connective relates semantically to Arg2. Sup1/Sup2: This attribute specifies either the material that makes the semantic contribution of the argument more specific (as in the PDTB), or the clause/sentence where an anaphoric element expressed in the argument is resolved. The Sup tag is not specifically used for anaphor resolution in the PDTB.  Mod: This tag specifies the following features: (a) the adverbs that are used along with connective heads, e.g. tam aksine ?just to the contrary?, (b) the focus particle dE used together with the connective head (e.g., ve de ?and-focus particle ?and?), (c) adverbs showing the determinacy of the relation, e.g. belki  ?perhaps?, sadece ?only? etc., (d) polarity of postpositional phrases (e.g. i?in de?il ?not for?). In the PDTB, the Mod category is utilized only for adverbs used together with connective heads. The other categories are used to capture aspects of attribution and verbs of attribution.   Shared: This attribute identifies the subjects, objects, or any temporal adverbs shared by the arguments of the discourse relation. This category was required for Turkish, which is a pro-drop and free word-order language. In Turkish, subjects, objects or adverbs can appear s-initially, s-medially or s-finally. Subjects and objects are dropped if they are salient in the discourse. This category allows us to capture the variable position of subjects, objects and adverbs shared by the arguments of a discourse relation.  The PDTB does not have this feature.    In what follows, we will report on the inter-coder reliability statistics on Arg1 and Arg2 of a set of connectives for which we obtained low inter-coder reliability results and discuss the most common inconsistencies. The remaining 
categories mentioned above are under use but inter-coder reliability statistics have not been calculated for them.  2 A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the inconsistent annotations in the TDB  So far, 60 types of discourse connectives amounting to 6873 relations have been annotated in the TDB project.  We computed the reliability of the coders? agreement for Arg1 and Arg2 of these connectives by means of the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996). A value of K agreement coefficient (henceforth K values) between 0.80 and 1.00 shows a good agreement, and a value between 0.60 and 0.80 indicates some agreement (Poesio, 2000). The K values we obtained for Arg1 and Arg2 of most connectives annotated so far range between 0.80 and 1.00 but for the connectives that are in focus in this paper, the K values for Arg1 are less than 0.80 (see Appendix B). It is these connectives that we now turn to.  These connectives are listed below again, along with the K values obtained for their Arg1 and Arg2. Before calculating the K values, all annotated text spans were re-processed in order to express the annotations in (pseudo) categories. During re-processing, for each annotator the annotated text span boundary characters (i.e., the beginning and end characters) were coded as 1 and the remaining text was coded as 0, so that an agreement table could be constructed (Artstein, and Poesio, 2008; Di Eugenio and Glass, 2004).  It is on the basis of this table which we measured inter-coder reliability.    Connective K value  Arg1 Arg2 yandan ?on the other hand? 0.523 0.645 ayr?ca ?in addition, separately? 0.545 0.760 ra?men ?despite, despite this? 0.688 0.742 fakat ?but? 0.719 0.855 tersine ?on the contrary? 0.741 1.000 dolay?s?yla ?as a result? 0.759 0.930 oysa ?however? 0.767 0.913 ama?la ?for this purpose? 0.785 0.876 Table 1. Eight connectives with K values less than 0.80 (total number of annotations: 554)  
284
For comparison, we provide the K values for two discontinuous connectives in Table 2:  Connective K value  Arg1 Arg2 ne .. ne ?neither nor? 0.820 0.930 hem .. hem ?both .. and? 1.000 0.982 Table 2. Two discontinous connectives with K values higher than 0.80 (total number of annotations: 126)  As seen in Table 2, inter-coder agreement in discontinuous connectives is high. We argue that discontinuous connectives are maximally different from anaphoric connectives (and discourse adverbials) since they unambiguously draw the boundaries of their arguments.  As a result, the inter-coder reliability tests yield good agreements, with K values > 0.80. Anaphoric connectives relate their second argument with another argument adjacent or nonadjacent to the connective, in a way much similar to how definite NPs find their antecedents in the previous discourse. Depending on the relation encoded by the connective, the previous discourse is likely to contain clauses that elaborate and expand a generalization, refute an assertion, list the components of a statement, explain the cause of an eventuality, etc. It may not be an easy task to decide whether one should take all or part of these clauses as Arg1; therefore inconsistencies are expected in drawing the Arg1?s boundaries. Arg2, on the other hand, is relatively easier to determine since it is syntactically related to the connective and hence its domain is determined. Example (2), which shows a relation encoded by the connective tersine ?on the contrary?, presents one of the most common cases of inconsistency in determining the Arg1 span.  (2) a. Eyleme de?il, karaktere a??rl?k veren modern romanda biliyoruz ki roman ki?ilerinin psikolojisi, i? d?nyas?, bilinci ve bilin?alt? yazar?n dikkatle ??zmeye ?al??t??? ilgin? sorunlar? i?erir.  (We) know that in the modern novel, which emphasizes character rather than action, the novel contains the interesting problems that the writer wants to solve and the characters? psychology, their inner world, consciousness, and the subconscious.   
b. Bundan ?t?r? ?nemli bir y?n?n? olu?turur roman?n.  For this reason, (it) constitutes an  important aspect of the novel. c. Ama gene biliyoruz ki halk edebiyat? ?r?nlerinde ?nemli olan ki?inin i? d?nyas? de?il,  But we also know that in folk literature what is important is not the person?s inner world, d. tersine, eylemidir.  on the contrary, (it) is his action.   Two annotators selected as Arg1 the italicized part in (2c) while the third one selected as Arg1 the clauses in (2a), and (2c). In fact, a careful analysis of the discourse connective tersine ?on the contrary? reveals that in all tokens in the corpus, the speaker introduces an assertion, then refutes some aspect of it with an overt negation and then rectifies it in Arg2.  (Turan and Zeyrek, 2010). The third annotator?s selection of Arg1 is compatible with this observation, while the other annotators? selection of Arg1 appears to be guided by the MP.   2.1 Common Sources of Disagreement An examination of the 8 connectives for which K values were below 0.80 for Arg1 or Arg2 showed that there were 6 main sources for the inconsistencies. These were (a) no overlapping annotations for Arg1, (b) partially overlapping annotations for Arg1 or (c) Arg2, (d) lack of adequate definitions in the guidelines, (e) annotators? errors in following the linguistic definitions in the guidelines, (f) other inconsistencies, e.g., errors in selecting spaces, leaving characters out, etc. (Appendix A). 4 Among these, partially overlapping Arg1 annotations is the major source of discrepancy observed in 63.98% of the inconsistent cases, followed by partially overlapping Arg2 annotations observed in 10.17% of the cases, and no overlapping annotations in 9.74% of the cases. While errors grouped under the ?other? category is 9.74%, annotators? errors in following the linguistic definitions in the guidelines is negligible (2.97%). The percentage of lacking definitions in the guidelines is also low (3.39%), showing that the coverage is good in the updated guidelines. Let us now turn to the                                                  4 There were also missing annotations but since we did not calculate inter-coder statistics for them, they are not mentioned in this work.

common sources of disagreement among annotators.  2.1.1 Interpretations of the minimality principle  A frequent reason for inconsistent annotations was lack of agreement in determining the exact boundaries of argument spans, which is ultimately related to how the MP is interpreted. For example, in (3), the connective fakat ?but? may be taken as linking clauses (3a) and (3b).  Yet, the scope of the predicative morpheme (i.e. ?t?r in (3c)) that determines finiteness is shared by the verbs of (3b) and (3c), i.e. this morpheme takes into its scope two consecutive clauses. While two annotators coded only clause (3b) as Arg2, the third annotator tended to interpret Arg2 as the clauses within the scope of the shared predicative morpheme (-t?r), coding (3b) and (3c) as Arg2. It appears that the disagreement in example (3) stems from different interpretations of the MP coupled with a structural property of Turkish.   (3) a. Onlara sunulan kurbanlar, ba?lang??ta insanlard?  At the beginning, it was humans that were sacrified for them.  b. Fakat bu ?det sonralar? hafifletilerek, insan yerine hayvanlar kurban edilme?e ba?lanm??,  But later on, loosening this tradition, (they) started to sacrifice animals instead of humans,  c. sonunda da bu hayvanlar? temsil eden baz? ?eylerin (?) k???t hayvan fig?rlerinin  (?) yahut da bir ta??n suya at?lmas?n?n yeterli olaca??na inan?lm??t?r.  finally, it was believed that it would be sufficient to throw a stone or paper animal figures to the water, as well as other objects that represent these animals.  The text given in (4) further illustrates a case where the annotators disagreed on the final boundary of Arg2. One annotator selected as Arg2 the span ?this is .. noted? (4b), while the other annotators selected the span ?this is?. a lost place? ((4b)-(4c)); i.e., they included as Arg2 not only the clause adjacent to the connective, but they also selected the clause that followed where the cataphor is resolved. Faced with such inconsistencies, we decided to annotate the material that is needed for pronoun resolution as supplementary text. In this case, the clause in (4c) is marked as Sup2.   
(4) a. ? ikincisindeki ayr?nt? bollu?u Recaizade Ekrem?in ger?ek?ili?ine atfedilmi?tir.   .. the richness of details in the second (novel) was attributed to Recaizade Ekrem?s realism. b. Oysa as?l dikkat ?ekmesi gereken ?udur:  However, this is what should be noted: c. Araba Sevdas?n?n ?aml?ca?s? yitik bir ?aml?ca?d?r.  The ?aml?ca described in Araba Sevdas? is a lost place.  The inconsistencies that derive from different interpretations of the minimality requirement is particularly interesting from a theoretical perspective. It appears that this principle may be interpreted as syntactic minimality as illustrated in example (3), and as a factor that goes against basic insights of discourse interpretation such as anaphor/cataphor resolution as in example (4). In the former case, the MP pulls the annotators in one direction, and the need to reflect their understanding of the discourse in the annotations pulls them in the opposite direction, especially when there is morphological/syntactic evidence for them to choose more than one clause. In the latter case, the annotators seem to feel they would lose the anaphoric/coreference chains in the discourse if they left out the text span where the anaphor was resolved.  After using the Sup label for anaphor resolution/coreference chains, disagreements of the latter sort diminished considerably but this was a methodological approach with a bias towards the MP rather than the desired solution of the role of anaphoric/coreference chains in argument spans. We aim to tackle this issue in further research.   A parenthetical or evaluative clause in the argument span also led to inconsistencies in determining argument boundaries. For example, the annotators gave conflicting decisions as to whether or not they should select parenthetical clauses, especially when they are s-medial, as in (5): (5)  Kemal, bir yandan askeri bir sava? verirken ?te yandan yerli i?birlik?ilerle ?ki bunlar?n ba??nda da bas?n- sava?mak zorunda kalm??t?r.  Kemal, while on the one hand fighting a military war, on the other hand (he) had to fight with local accomplices ?which mainly included the media.  
286
Disagreements that arise from parenthetical clauses have diminished after we added a new principle to the guidelines, asking annotators to select the parenthetical together with the argument if it contributed to the meaning of the argument.    2.1.2 Ambiguity  Another reason for inconsistent annotations was ambiguity in meaning. Consider example (1) once again, where the contrast relation can be interpreted in three ways: it is not clear whether the contrast is between to be surprised in (1a) and to regain composure in (1c) or whether it is between not expecting such a thing in (1b) and to regain composure in (1c). Alternatively, the contrast can be interpreted between (1a) and (1b) on the one hand, and between (1a) and (1c) on the other. We observed that some of the disagreements concerning the span of Arg 1 stemmed from such cases.   2.1.3 Type of discourse relation  Yet another type of inconsistency appears to be associated with the type of discourse relation. Sanders and Noordman (2000) and Pitler, et. al. (2008) state that causal (contingency) relations are among the most salient coherence relations. They suggest that the connectives that signal comparison and contingency are mostly unambiguous. Being cognitively salient, causal and contingency relations are more tightly organized than the additive list relation. This is because in causal relations, one target sentence is more important than the other; while in a list relation there is more than one sentence contributing to the discourse. Sanders and Noordman (2000:53) argue that causal relations are more strongly connecting than additive relations. This salience in discourse relations can be universal.  In fact, we found that the inter-coder agreement of the causal connective ??nk? ?because? was high (0.888 for Arg1 and 0.941 for Arg2). However, for the connective ayr?ca ?in addition to?, which encodes the list relation, the inter-coder K value was 0.545 for Arg1, 0.765 for Arg 2. An example of the list reading interpretation of this connective is illustrated in (6) below.  (6) a. Baban?n ya?am? art?k derli toplu olmu?tu.   The father?s life now became orderly.   b. Evde kavgalar da azalm??t?.  The fights at home have diminished 
c. Ayr?ca yeni bir ?evrede de bulunuyorlard?.  Besides, (they) are now in a new neighborhood.   In the extract given in (6), the topic under discussion seems to be the list of the family?s diminishing problems: Father?s having an orderly life, reduced fights at home, etc.  While two annotators preferred to select (6b) as Arg 1, the third one preferred to select (6a) and (6b) together.  The connective ayr?ca, marking a weaker relation between its two arguments, is among the connectives that yielded such instances of disagreement.   2.1.4 Nominalized arguments  In this section, we will report on some preliminary results about a common inconsistency that occurred while annotating the connective ve ?and,? namely the problem of teasing apart nominalized arguments that have an abstract object interpretation and those that do not. We also explain the pair annotation process. In Turkish, a nominalizing process realized by various inflectional suffixes forms nonfinite clauses. The clauses formed by some of these suffixes are abstract enough to be easily specified as an argument of a discourse relation, e.g. ?mAk. On the other hand, some of the suffixes (e.g. ?mA, -I?) are very productive in deriving ordinary nouns referring to actual instances or things. It is these cases where disagreement among the annotators increases. Example (7) illustrates the use of ?mAk, where the clauses it forms were easily determined as arguments with abstract object interpretations.   (7)  18. y?zy?l?n yapt???,  17. Y?zy?l?n yaratt?klar?n? ?o?altmak ve yaymakt?r.  What the 18th century did was to increase and to extend what the 17th century created.  Example (8) shows a difficult case where the annotators were inconsistent in deciding whether the connective?s arguments have abstract object interpretations or not. This is because the morphological form of the words geli?me (improve-mA) ?improvement? and yap?la?ma (construct-mA) ?(re)construction? are very much the same as the words bekleme (wait-mA) ?waiting? and arama (search-mA) ?search, searching? shown in (9). The final decision was to annotate (9) only.  
287
(8)  Deprem b?lgesinde yeniden [geli?me] ve [yap?la?man?n] planlanmas? gibi ciddi bir sorun bulunmaktad?r.  There is the important issue of planning the [improvement] and [re-construction] of the areas affected by the earthquake.   (9)  Art?k onu beklemenin ve araman?n bo?una oldu?unu anlam??t?r.  He has already figured out that it was futile to wait for her and to search her.   We noticed such inconsistencies in annotating 1/3 of the files for and. When we shifted to the pair annotation procedure, we obtained high agreement on Arg1 and Arg2 annotations of and because we observed that when done in pairs, resolving any disagreements between the annotations was faster since the members of the pair discussed difficult cases between them and sometimes determined a preferred annotation before presenting the results to the group. Table 3 shows the results for and annotations. A repeated measures test shows that the increase in K values is significant (p< 0.01).  Annotators K value  Arg1 Arg2 3 annotators 0.692 0.791 A pair of annotators and an independent annotator 0.945 0.964 Table 3 K values for ve ?and? of 3 independent annotators, and a pair and an independent annotator 3 Summary  In this paper we presented common sources of disagreement we observed in annotating the arguments of discourse connectives in the TDB, a project of discourse-level annotation on written Turkish. We defined our annotation scheme and annotation cycle. We achieved high agreement on argument annotations of discontinuous connectives but agreement on some other connectives was low, particularly for Arg1. Since these connectives belong to different syntactic classes, the inconsistencies cannot be easily explained by the properties of the syntactic class of connectives. We discussed various potential factors affecting inter-coder agreement, including the minimality principle coupled with language specific properties, the structure of discourse (as in the case of our example in tersine), cognitive salience of discourse relations, 
and ambiguity.? We discussed inconsistencies resulting form the difficulty of distinguishing the non-abstract object interpretation of a nominalized clause from its abstract object interpretation. We argued that once inter-coder reliability stabilizes, it is beneficial to shift to the procedure where a pair of annotators works together to annotate a specific connective while the third works independently.

Abstract 
Various discourse theories have argued for da-
ta structures ranging from the simplest trees to 
the most complex chain graphs. This paper in-
vestigates the structure represented by the ex-
plicit connectives annotated in the multiple-
genre Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB). The de-
pendencies that violate tree-constraints are an-
alyzed. The effects of information structure in 
the surface form, which result in seemingly 
complex configurations with underlying sim-
ple dependencies, are introduced; and the 
structural implications are discussed. The re-
sults indicate that our current approach to local 
discourse structure needs to accommodate 
properly contained arguments and relations, 
and partially overlapping as well as shared ar-
guments; deviating further from simple trees, 
but not as drastically as a chain graph structure 
would imply, since no genuine cases of struc-
tural crossing dependencies are attested in 
TDB. 
1 Introduction 
A variety of structures for discourse representa-
tion has been proposed, including successive 
trees of varying sizes connected and occasionally 
intertwined at the peripheries (Hobbs, 1985), a 
single tree structure (Rhetorical Structure Theo-
ry, RST, Mann & Thompson, 1988), entity 
chains (Knott et al 2001), tree-adjoining gram-
mars (Discourse-Lexicalized Tree Adjoining 
Grammar, D-LTAG, Webber, 2004), directed 
acyclic graphs (Lee et al, 2006, 2008) and chain 
graphs (Wolf & Gibson, 2005).  
The simplest of these structures is a tree, 
which treats discourse structure simpler than 
sentence-level syntax. The most complex repre-
sentation, chain graphs that allow for crossing 
dependencies and other tree-violations, treats 
discourse as more complex than sentence level. 
We know since the work of Shieber (1985) and 
Joshi (1985) that sentence-level structures re-
quire more than context-free power, but not to 
the extent of dealing with general graphs, or with 
strings that grow out of constant control.  It is of 
general interest to discover whether such com-
plexity occurs in natural discourses, because we 
would like to know how far discourse structures 
deviate from applicative semantics. (Applicative 
structures are binary operations on data; for ex-
ample a connective?s meaning depending only on 
two arguments. A system is applicative if it only 
makes use of function application, but not e.g. 
graph reduction or general function composition. 
The concepts are distinct but related: function 
application can be linked to applicative structures 
by currying.) If more complex structures are 
found, we must go above applicative semantics, 
and we must worry about function compositions 
and graph reductions, which are known to re-
quire more computational power.  
2 Turkish Discourse Bank 
Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is the first large-
scale publicly available language resource with 
discourse level annotations for Turkish built on a 
~ 400,000-word sub-corpus of METU Turkish 
Corpus (MTC) (Say et al, 2002), annotated in 
the style of Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) 
(Prasad et al, 2008). The TDB Relations are 
annotated for explicit discourse connectives, 
which link two spans of text that can be inter-
preted as Abstract Objects (Asher, 1993). Con-
nectives are annotated together with their modi-
fiers and arguments,and with supplementary 
materials for the arguments (Zeyrek & Webber, 
2008; Zeyrek et al, 2010). The first release of 
TDB is available at http://medid.ii.metu.edu.tr/.  
122
  
As in PDTB, the connectives in TDB come 
from a variety of syntactic classes (Zeyrek & 
Webber, ibid). The coordinating and subordinat-
ing conjunctions such as ve ?and? and i?in ?for? 
and ?in order to?, respectively, are considered 
structural connectives, meaning that they take 
both arguments structurally. Discourse adverbials 
and phrasal expressions that are built by combin-
ing a discourse-anaphoric element with a subor-
dinating conjunction are considered to be ana-
phoric connectives, meaning that they only take 
the argument that is syntactically related, and the 
other argument is interpreted anaphorically. In 
PDTB and TDB style, the syntactically related 
argument is called the second argument (Arg2), 
and the other argument is called the first argu-
ment (Arg1), for both structural and anaphoric 
connectives. The syntactic class of the discourse 
connective will be included in the further releas-
es of TDB along with the sense of the discourse 
relations, and some morphological features for 
the arguments of subordinating conjunctions 
(Demir?ahin et al, 2012). 
3 Discourse Relation Configurations in 
Turkish 
Lee et al (2006) identified independent relations 
and fully embedded relations as conforming to 
the tree structure, and shared arguments, proper-
ly contained arguments, pure crossing, and par-
tially overlapping arguments as departures from 
the tree structure in PDTB. Although most depar-
tures from the tree structure can be accounted for 
by non-structural explanations, such as anaphora 
and attribution, Lee et al (2006, 2008) state that 
shared arguments may have to be accepted in 
discourse structure. 
Akta? et al (2010) identified similar structures 
in TDB, adding nested relations that do not vio-
late tree structure constraints, as well as properly 
contained relations that introduce further devia-
tions from trees. Following their terminology, we 
will reserve the word relation to discourse rela-
tions (or coherence relations), and use the term 
configuration to refer to relations between dis-
course relations.  
1.1 Independent, Fully Embedded and 
Nested Relations 
The first release of TDB consists of 8,484 explic-
it relations. The argument spans of some dis-
course connectives do not overlap with those of 
any other connectives in the corpus. We call 
them independent relations. All others are called 
non-independent relations. We have identified 
2,548 non-independent configurations consisting 
of 3,474 unique relations, meaning that 5,010 
relations (59.05%) are independent. Table 1 
shows the distribution of 2,548 non-independent 
configurations.

Since full embedding and nested relations con-
form to tree structure, these configurations will 
not be discussed further. The following subsec-
tions discuss the suitability of explanations in-
volving anaphora and attribution to tree-violating 
configurations. Those that cannot be completely 
explained away must be accommodated by the 
discourse structure. 
1.2 Shared Arguments 
Lee et al (2006, 2008) state that shared argu-
ment is one of the configurations that cannot be 
explained away, and should be accommodated by 
discourse structure. Similarly, Egg & Redeker 
(2008) admit that even in a corpus annotated 
within RST Framework, which enforces tree 
structure by annotation guidelines, there is a 
genre-specific structure that is similar to the 
shared arguments in Lee et al (2006). 
 
  
Figure 1 - Shared Argument

Of the 489 shared arguments in TDB, 331 be-
long to anaphoric discourse relations (i.e. rela-
tions in which at least one of the connectives 
involved is either a discourse adverbial or a 
phrasal expression) (67.69%). In the remaining 
158 relations (32.31%), arguments are shared by 
structural connectives. (1) is an example of a 
shared argument.

?It was easy to give up, so was to postpone. But 
once you start climbing you have to go all the 
way! Because there was a cruel comeback 
everytime.? 
 
All examples are from TDB; the first line indi-
cates the file name (00077211 in (1)), and the 
browser index of the connectives involved in the 
configuration (2 & 3 in (1)). The first arguments 
(Arg1) of the connectives are in italic, the second 
arguments (Arg2) are in bold. The connectives 
themselves are underlined. For the sake of sim-
plicity, the modifiers of the connectives are dis-
played as part of the connective, and the shared 
tags are omitted when they are immaterial to the 
configuration being discussed. 
In (1), the first argument of but (relation 2) 
annotated in (a) completely overlaps with the 
first argument of because (relation 3), annotated 
in (b) on the same text for comparison. The result 
is a shared argument configuration. 
1.3 Properly Contained Relations and Ar-
guments 
In TDB there are 1,018 properly contained rela-
tions, almost half of which (471 relations; 
46.27%) are caused by anaphoric relations. 
Properly contained relations where anaphoric 
connectives are not involved can be caused by 
attribution, complement clauses, and relative 
clauses. (2) is a relation within a relative clause 
(a), which is part of another relation in the matrix 
clause (b). The result is a properly contained 
relation.

Figure 2 - Properly Contained Relation vs. Full 
Embedding 
 
Sometimes a verb of attribution is the only el-
ement that causes proper containment. Lee et al 
(2006) argue that since the relation between the 
verb of attribution and the owner of the attribu-
tion is between an abstract object and an entity, 
and not between two abstract objects, it is not a 
124
  
relation on the discourse level. Therefore, those 
stranded verbs of attribution should not be re-
garded as tree-structure violations. In (3) the 
properly contained relations occur in a quote, but 
the intervening materials are more than just verbs 
of attribution. Because the intervening materials 
in (3) are whole sentences that participate in 
complex discourse structures, we believe that (3) 
is different than the case proposed by Lee et al 
(2006) and should be considered a genuine case 
of properly contained relation.

member it vividly, in a stormy night, they sank 
by the west of the Black Sea. He was a captain, 
but he couldn?t swim, my uncle. When he 
washed ashore holding onto a piece of driftwood, 
they pried open his arms with great difficulty, he 
was half frozen. Maybe at that moment he was 
begging God for help, because he was a very 
religious man. But not anymore, now he hits the 
bottle and plays the violin in taverns.? Then he 
sees Nesli?s interested frown and laughs: 
?You?re so gullible!?   
(b) "Evet, [...] Ama art?k de?il; k?p gibi i?ip

"?ok istavritsin!" 
?Yes, [...]But not anymore, now he hits the bottle 
and plays the violin in taverns.? Then he sees 
Nesli?s interested frown and laughs: ?You?re 
so gullible!? 
 
Whereas attribution can be discarded as a non-
discourse relation, a discourse model based on 
discourse connectives should be able to accom-
modate partially contained relations resulting 
from relations within complements of verbs and 
relative clauses. 
 
  
Figure 3 - Properly Contained Argument 
As in properly contained relations, properly 
contained arguments may arise when an abstract 
object that is external to a quote is in a relation 
with an abstract object in a quote. Likewise, a 
discourse relation within the complement of a 
verb or a relative clause can cause properly con-
tained arguments. Anaphoric connectives ac-
count for the 129 (66.49%) of the 194 properly 
contained arguments in TDB.  
1.4 Partial Overlap 
There are only 12 partial overlaps in TDB, and 
3 of them involve anaphoric relations. 
 
  
Figure 4 - Partial Overlap 
 
In (4), the argument span of in order to par-
tially overlaps with the argument span of to. This 
is a partial overlap of the arguments of two struc-
tural connectives.

?The fact that the governtment took action in 
order to reopen the casinos that were closed 
down in 1998 in order to come up with a solu-
tion to the resource problem caused argu-
ments.? 
 
The first argument of relation 44 (a) properly 
contains the first argument of 45 (b), whereas the 
second argument of (b) properly contains the 
second argument of (a). This double containment 
results in a complicated structure that will be 
analyzed in detail in ?3.5. 
In (5) the second argument of but (relation 42 
(a)) contains only one of the two conjoined 
clauses, whereas the first argument of after (rela-
tion 43 (b)) contains both of them. The most 
probable cause for this difference in annotations 
is the combination of ?blind annotation? with the 
?minimality principle.? This principle guides the 
participants to annotate the minimum text span 
required to interpret the relation. Since the anno-
tators cannot see previous annotations, they have 
to assess the minimum span of an argument 
again when they annotate the second relation. 
Sometimes the minimal span for one relation is 
annotated differently than the minimal span re-
quired for the other, resulting in partial overlaps.

ed to see, but after waiting patiently for

1.5 Pure Crossing 
There are only 2 pure crossing examples in the 
current release of TDB, a number so small that it 
is tempting to treat them as negligible. However, 
the inclusion of pure crossing would result in the 
most dramatic change in discourse structure, 
raising the complexity level to chain graph and 
making discourse structure markedly more com-
plex than sentence level grammar. Therefore, we 
would like to discuss both examples in detail.

?And then suddenly there is a sound. Footsteps.

?And then suddenly there is a sound. Footsteps. 
Someone has an errand to run, they walk hur-
riedly or run. Then the girl stiffens suddenly. 
The boy stiffens, too; and every run has a hid-
den wish.?
 
In (6), the discourse relation encoded by then 
is not only anaphoric -and therefore not determi-
nant in terms of discourse structure- but also the 
crossing annotation does not necessarily arise 
from the coherence relation of the connective?s 
arguments. It is more likely imposed by lexical 
cohesive elements (Halliday & Hasan, 1976), as 
the annotators apparently made use of the repeti-
tions of ans?z?n ?suddenly? and ko? ?run? in the 
text when they could not interpret the intended 
meaning. 
 
  
Figure 5 - Pure Crossing 
 
The other example, given in (7), is not ana-
phoric. It is more interesting as it points to a pe-
culiar structure similar to (4) in ?3.4, a surface 
crossing which is frequent in the subordinating 
conjunctions of Turkish.

?The penalty was given because Telekom abused 
its monopoly status in the two different internet 
infrastructure markets and because it caused 
difficulties with its rivals? activities although it 
did not have a monopoly status in the satellite 
management market anymore.? 
 
A closer inspection reveals that the pure cross-
ings in (7) are caused by two distinct reasons.  
The first reason is the repetition of the subor-
dinator i?in ?because?. Had there been only the 
rightmost subordinator, the relation would be a 
simple case of Full Embedding, where ve ?and? 
in (b) connects the two reasons for the penalty, 
while the rightmost subordinator connects the 
combined reasons to the matrix clause (see Fig-
ure 6). However, since both subordinators were 
present, they were annotated separately. They 
share their first arguments, and take different 
spans as their second arguments, which are also 
connected by ve ?and?, resulting in an apparent 
pure crossing.  
Our alternative analysis is that ve ?and? actual-
ly takes the subordinators i?in ?because? in its 
scope, and it should be analyzed similar to an 
assumed single-subordinator case. This kind of 
annotation was not available in TDB because the 
annotation guidelines state that the discourse 
connectives at the peripheries of the arguments 
should be left out. Machine Learning can help us 
spot these instances. 
The second reason for crossing is the wrap-
ping of the first arguments of (a) and (c) around 
the subordinate clause. This crossing is in fact 
not a configuration-level dependency, but a rela-
tion-level surface phenomenon confined within 
the relation anchored by i?in ?because?, without 
underlying complex discourse semantics. Exam-
ple (8) is a simpler case where the surface cross-
ing within the relation can be observed.

b. Single-subordinator (hypothetical)

Commodity Exchange Market but cannot ob-
tain a result.? 
 
Subordinators in Turkish form adverbial 
clauses (Kornfilt, 1997), so they can occupy any 
position that is legitimate for a sentential adverb. 
Wrapping in discourse seems to be motivated 
information-structurally. In the unmarked posi-
tion, the subordinate clause comes before the 
matrix clause and introduces a theme. However, 
the discourse constituents can occupy different 
positions or carry non-neutral prosodic features 
to express different information structures 
(Demir?ahin, 2008). In (7), wrapping takes ceza 
?penalty? away from the rheme and makes it part 
of the theme, at the same time bringing the caus-
al discourse relation into the rheme. 
As is clear from the gloss in (7) and its 
stringset, this is function application, where ceza 
verildi ?penalty was given? wraps in the first 
argument as a whole. Double occurrence of the 
?connective? within the wrapped-in argument is 
causing the apparent crossing, but there is in fact 
one discourse relation. 
  
Figure 7 - Wrapping 
 
Wrapping in discourse is almost exclusive to 
subordinating conjunctions, possibly due to their 
adverbial freedom in sentence-level syntax. The 
subordinators make up 468 of the total of 479 
wrapping cases identified in TDB. However, 
there are also four cases of coordinating conjunc-
tions with wrapping. Two of them result in sur-
face crossing as in (9), and the other two build a 
nested-like structure, as in (10) and (11). The 
latter two are both parentheticals.

In (9) ve ?and? links two relative clauses, one

should be noted that the first part of Arg1 
(Bezirci-nin) has an ambiguous suffix. The suffix 
could be the agreement marker of the relative 
clause, as reflected in the annotation, or it could 
be the genitive marked complement of the geni-
tive-possessive construction Bezirci?nin antoloji 
haz?rl??? ?Bezirci?s anthology preparation?. The 
latter analysis does not cause wrapping.

justed their lives according to this cannon shot.? 
 
Both (10) and (11) are parentheticals, resulting 
in a double-wrapping-like construction (Figure 
8). However, parentheticals move freely in the 
clause and occupy various positions, so we be-
lieve that this construction should be taken as a 
peculiarity of the parenthetical, rather than the 
structural connectives involved in the relation.

4 Conclusion 
In this paper we presented possible deviations 
from the tree structure in the first release of 
TDB. Following Lee et al (2006, 2008) and 
Akta? et al (2010). We have scanned the corpus 
for shared arguments, properly contained rela-
tions and arguments, partial overlaps, and pure 
crossings. Overall, about half of these configura-
tions can be accounted for by anaphoric rela-
tions, i.e. they are not applicative structures (see 
Table 2). Note that if one of the relations in a 
configuration is anaphoric, we treat the configu-
ration as anaphoric.

Table 2: Distribution of anaphoric relations 
among tree-violating configurations 
 
In addition to the shared arguments that were 
accepted in discourse structure by Lee et al, we 
have also come up with partially contained rela-
tions arising from verbal complements and rela-
tive clauses. These structures can be treated dif-
ferently in other frameworks; for instance in 
RST, they are treated as discourse constituents 
taking part in coherence relations. However, for 
the connective-based approach adopted in this 
study, they need to be accommodated as devia-
tions from tree structure.  
The few partial overlaps we have encountered 
could mostly be explained away by wrapping and 
by different interpretations of annotation guide-
lines by the annotators, especially the minimality 
principle. Recall that wrap has applicative se-
mantics. Of the two pure crossing examples we 
have found, one was also anaphoric, whereas the 
other could be explained in terms of information-
structurally motivated relation-level surface 
crossing, rather than configuration-level crossing 
dependency. In other words, if we leave the pro-
cessing of information structure to other process-
es, the need for more elaborate annotation disap-
pears. In Joshi?s (2011) terminology, immediate 
discourse in the TDB appears to be an applica-
tive structure, which, unlike syntax, seems to be 
in no need of currying.  
As a result, we can state that pure crossing (i.e. 
crossing of the arguments of structural connec-
tives) is not genuinely attested in the current 
release of TDB. The annotation scheme need not 
be enriched to allow more complex algorithms to 
deal with unlimited use of crossing. There seems 
to be a reason in every contested case to go back 
to the annotation, and revise it in ways to keep 
the applicative semantics, without losing much of 
the connective?s meaning.  
  In summary, our preliminary analysis shows 
that discourse structure may have to accommo-
date partial containment and wrap in addition to 
shared arguments. TDB has an applicative struc-
ture.   
  Taking into account that independent relations, 
fully embedded relations and nested relations are 
frequent in discourse structure, and that the dis-
course structure should accommodate shared 
arguments and partial containments; we are cur-
rently inclined to think of discourse structure as 
Hobbs (1985) does: local trees of various sizes 
connected and occasionally intertwined at the 
edges. Further complications within trees are an 
open field for further studies.

Abstract 
In an attempt to extend Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) / Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) 
style annotations to spoken Turkish, this paper presents the first attempt at annotating the explicit 
discourse connectives in the Spoken Turkish Corpus (STC) demo version. We present the data 
and the method for the annotation. Then we reflect on the issues and challenges of transitioning 
from written to spoken language. We present the preliminary findings suggesting that the distri-
bution of the search tokens and their use as discourse connectives are similar in the TDB and the 
STC demo. 
1 Introduction 
Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is the first discourse-annotated corpus of Turkish, which follows the 
principles of Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) and includes annotations for dis-
course connectives, their arguments, modifiers and supplements of the arguments. The TDB is built on 
a ~ 400,000-word sub-corpus of METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002), a 2 million-word 
multi-genre corpus of post-1990 written Turkish1. 
In both PDTB and TDB, the discourse connectives link two text spans that can be interpreted as, or 
can be anaphorically resolved to abstract objects (Asher, 2003). The PDTB includes annotations for both 
explicit and implicit connectives, whereas TDB has covered only explicit connectives so far.  
The explicit discourse connectives annotated in TDB come from a variety of syntactic classes, namely 
coordinating conjunctions (ve ?and?), subordinating conjunctions (i?in ?for/since?) and discourse adver-
bials (ancak ?however?). It also annotates phrasal expressions (Zeyrek et al, 2013).  
The coordinating and subordinating conjunctions are ?structural? discourse connectives that take their 
arguments syntactically, whereas discourse adverbials only take one argument syntactically, and the 
other one anaphorically (Forbes-Riley et al. 2006). For all syntactic types, the argument that syntacti-
cally accommodates the discourse connective is called the second argument (Arg2). The other argument 
is called the first argument (Arg1). In TDB, phrasal expressions consist of an anaphoric element and a 
subordinating conjunction. In PTDB, similar expressions are annotated as AltLex, a subtype of implicit 
connectives (Prasad et al. 2008). For example, onun i?in ?because of that? in (1) is annotated as a dis-
course connective with its two argument spans. In the rest of the paper, the connective is underlined, the 
Arg2 is in bold face, and Arg1 is shown in italics. Supplementary materials and modifiers are shown in 
square brackets labelled with subscripts when necessary.

(1) O ses dinleme cihaz?. ?dev var da. Onun i?in sizi dinliyorum ?u anda. 
     ?That is a recording device. I have homework. Because of that I?m recording you right 
now.? 
 
The TDB has chosen to annotate these expressions as discourse connectives because they are highly 
frequent and have limited compositional productivity. Furthermore, some phrasal expressions such as 
bunun aksine ?contrary to this?, aksi takdirde ?however? are so frequent that the native speakers perceive 
them as single lexical entries.  
In an attempt to extend the PDTB/TDB style discourse annotation to spoken Turkish, we have anno-
tated the search tokens in TDB on the Spoken Turkish Corpus (STC) (Ruhi et al.2009; 2010) demo 
version2. Following the TDB conventions, we annotated the phrasal expressions such as onun i?in ?be-
cause of that? and ondan sonra ?after that?. The annotation of 77 search tokens identified in TDB yielded 
a total of 416 relations in the STC demo. 
In this paper we first present the data from the STC demo release, the method we used for annotations, 
and issues and challenges we have met. Then we present our preliminary findings. Finally, we discuss 
the methods and the findings of the study and draw a road map for future work. 
2 Annotating Spoken Turkish 
2.1 The Data 
The Spoken Turkish Corpus demo version is a ~20,000-word resource of spoken Turkish. The demo 
version contains 23 recordings amounting to 2 hours 27 minutes. Twenty of the recordings include cas-
ual conversations and encounters, comprising 2 hours 1 minutes of the total, the 3 remaining recordings 
are broadcasts lasting a total of 26 minutes. The casual conversations include a variety of situations such 
as conversations among families, relatives and friends, and service encounters. The broadcasts are news 
commentaries. The topics of conversation range from daily activities such as infant care and naming 
babies to biology e.g. the endocrine system, to politics such as European Union membership process or 
the clearing of the mine fields on Syrian border. Such wide range of topics provide for a wide coverage 
of possible uses of discourse connectives even in such a relatively small corpus.  
2.2 Annotation Method 
Since our main aim was to follow the PDTB/TDB style, we chose to use the Discourse Annotation Tool 
for Turkish (DATT) (Akta? et al., 2010). We used the transcription texts included in the STC demo 
version as the DATT input and provided the annotators with separate audio files. 
This approach was a trade-off: the annotators could not make use of the rich features of the time-
aligned annotation of the STC; but by importing text transcripts directly into an existing specialized 
annotation tool we did not have to go through any software development and/or integration stage. The 
annotators reported only slight discomfort in matching the text and the audio file during annotation, but 
stated that it was manageable as none of the files are long enough to get lost between the two environ-
ments.  
2.3 Issues and Challenges 
Some of the challenges of annotating discourse connectives we have already observed in written lan-
guage transfer to the spoken modality. For example, in written discourse it is possible for an expression 
to be ambiguous between a discourse and non-discourse use, as the anaphoric elements can refer to both 
abstract objects and non-abstract entities. This applies to spoken language as well.  
 
(2) SER000062: ?ey Glomerulus o yuvarlak topun ad? m?yd? (bu)? Ordan ?ey oluyor?  
AFI000061: h?-h? h?-h?  
AFI000061: S?z?lme ondan sonra oluyor ama. ?u Henle kulpu falan var ya. ??yle geri. 
 
2 The STC demo version is freely available to researches at http://std.metu.edu.tr  
106
     ?SER000062: Um Glomerulus was (this) the name of that round ball? Stuff happens there ?  
AFI000061: Yes, yes. 
AFI000061: Filtration occurs after that, though. That Loop of Henle and such. Reverse like 
this.? 
 
In (2) ondan sonra ?after that? could be interpreted as resolving to the clause ?Stuff happens there?, 
which is an abstract object although a vague one. The pronoun can also refer to the glomerulus, which 
is an NP. This was exactly the case during the annotation of this specific example: one annotator inter-
preted it as a temporal discourse connective that indicates the order of two sub-processes of kidney 
function, whereas the other annotator interpreted that o ?that? refers to the NP and did not annotate this 
instance of ondan sonra. As a TDB principle, if an expression has at least one discourse connective 
meaning, it is annotated. As a result, this example was annotated as per the first annotator?s annotation. 
In spoken language, particularly spontaneous casual dialogues, phrasal expressions can take their first 
arguments from anywhere in the previous discourse. This is very much like discourse adverbials. For 
example, i?in in (3) displays an unattested use in TDB, as it appears distant from both its arguments, 
allowing the participant to question the discourse relation between two previous text spans. Given the 
supplemental material ?thyroxin increases the metabolism? in line (a) by speaker AFI, speaker SER 
provides two propositions, ?thyroxin is secreted by the thyroid gland? in line (b) and ?people with over-
active thyroids tend to be hyperactive? in line (e). In line (h), AFI offers a discourse connective ?be-
cause? in order to show her understanding of the preceding discourse, i.e., something like ?(so they tend 
to be very active) because of that??, where the material in parentheses are elided. One can argue that this 
connective builds a new discourse relation with one anaphoric and one elliptic argument. Nevertheless, 
we kept the annotations as shown in the example, because (a) it was the most intuitive annotation ac-
cording to the annotators and (b) the DATT does not allow annotation of ellipsis as arguments for now.  
 
(3) (a) AFI000061: [SUPP1Tiroksin. Ha bak. Metabolizma h?z?n? artt?r?yor.] 
[?] 
(b) SER000062: Tiroit bezinden tiroksin salg?lan?yor. 
(c) AFI000061: Hmm salg?lan?yor dedin sen. Tamam. Do?ru.  
(d) SER000062: Tamam.  
(e) SER000062: Hatta tiroit ?ey olan? Emm tiroidinde sorun olanlar ?ok ee ?ey olur ya 
aktif olur ya.  
(f) AFI000061: Hmm?  
(g) SER000062: ?ok hareketli olurlar. Evet.  
(h) AFI000061: Onun i?in [MODmi]? 
 
     ?(a) AFI000061: [SUPP1Thyroxin. Oh look. It speeds up the metabolism.] 
[?] 
(b) SER000062: Thyroxin is secreted by the thyroid gland.  
(c) AFI000061: Hmm you said secreted. Ok. Right. 
(d) SER000062: Ok.  
(e) SER000062: Actually thyroid is the one that? Emm you know, those who have prob-
lems with thyroid are ee they tend to be very active.  
(f) AFI000061: Hmm?  
(g) SER000062: They tend to be very energetic. Yes.  
(h) AFI000061: [MOD Is (it)] because of that?? 
 
Another problem with spoken corpus is that some elements may be missing. There are many examples 
that could not be annotated as discourse connectives, because the speakers were interrupted before they 
could complete, or at times even start, the latter argument of a possible discourse relation. In other 
examples, the argument may be there but not recorded clearly, or may be completely inaudible even 
though they were uttered because of background noise or overlapping arguments.

3 Preliminary Findings 
In this section we present some of our preliminary findings and compare them to the TDB to the extent 
possible. Because of the large difference in size between the two corpora, we converted the raw numbers 
to frequencies. We used number/1000 words as the frequency unit in Table 1.  
The top five most frequent connectives in the TDB in descending order are ve ?and?, i?in ?for?, ama 
?but?, sonra ?later? and ancak ?however? and  the top five most frequent connectives in the STC are ama 
?but?, ve  ?and?, mesela ?for example?,  sonra ?later? and i?in ?for?.  Here we compare the four most 
frequent connectives, namely, ve, i?in, ama and sonra, which make up 4951 (58.3%) of the total 8484 
annotations in TDB and 217 (52.2%) of the total 416 relations annotated in the STC.

Table 1 - Written and spoken uses of ve, i?in, ama, and sonra. 
 
Although both the frequency of the total occurrences of the connectives and their discourse uses seem 
to be lower in the spoken corpus, chi square tests show that the differences are not statically significant 
(p>0.5). The percentage of the use of tokens as discourse connectives across modalities is not significant 
either (p>0.5). The preliminary results indicate that the distribution of these five connectives and their 
uses as discourse connective are similar in written and spoken language.   
The similarity is expected, as the MTC and the subcorpus that the TDB is built on are multi-genre 
corpora. Specifically, the TDB includes novels and stories, which in turn include dialogues. Also, there 
are interviews in news excerpts, which are basically transcriptions of spoken language. As a result, the 
TDB texts reflect some aspects of spoken language. In addition, 3 of the 23 files of the STC demo are 
news broadcasts and interviews, which are probably scripted and/or prepared. Thus they may not nec-
essarily reflect all aspects of spontaneous spoken language.   
4 Discussion and Conclusion 
In this paper we presented a preliminary attempt at annotating Turkish Spoken Language in PDTB/TDB 
style. We used the transcripts and audio files of STC demo as our source, and used DATT of TDB to 
annotate the discourse relations. As future work, we intend to integrate the discourse annotation to the 
time-aligned annotation of the STC, thus allowing the users to benefit from the features of both annota-
tion schemes. 
During the annotation process, we encountered the use of discourse connectives unattested in TDB, 
specifically i?in ?since/for? in a predicative/interrogative position, where the connective occurs with its 
deictic Arg1. We assume that the question in which this connective is used has a rhetorical role, possibly 
expressing the speaker?s understanding of the discourse relation in the previous discourse. Apart from 
this newly attested use, the distribution of the search tokens and their use as discourse connectives re-
main largely similar to that of the TDB. We conclude that this similarity results from the fact that the 
TDB includes some features of the spoken language just as the STC demo may include scripted record-
ing. Yet, we suspect that the occurrence of discourse connectives with a deictic Arg1 is quite frequent 
in spoken language. We leave the investigation of such occurrences, and other issues such as the genre 
breakdown of the frequency of discourse connectives in STC for further study.  
Our goal for the near future is to complete at least a second set of double-blind annotations and the 
agreement statics on the STC, so that the discourse-level annotation of spoken Turkish can be compared 
to those of the TDB.
