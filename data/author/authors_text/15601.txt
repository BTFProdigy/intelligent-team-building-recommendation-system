Abstract
We propose a simple training regime that can
improve the extrinsic performance of a parser,
given only a corpus of sentences and a way
to automatically evaluate the extrinsic quality
of a candidate parse. We apply our method
to train parsers that excel when used as part
of a reordering component in a statistical ma-
chine translation system. We use a corpus of
weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide
parser training. Our best parsers contribute
significant improvements in subjective trans-
lation quality while their intrinsic attachment
scores typically regress.
1 Introduction
The field of syntactic parsing has received a great
deal of attention and progress since the creation of
the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993; Collins,
1997; Charniak, 2000; McDonald et al, 2005;
Petrov et al, 2006; Nivre, 2008). A common?
and valid?criticism, however, is that parsers typi-
cally get evaluated only on Section 23 of the Wall
Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank. This
is problematic for many reasons. As previously ob-
served, this test set comes from a very narrow do-
main that does not necessarily reflect parser perfor-
mance on text coming from more varied domains
(Gildea, 2001), especially web text (Foster, 2010).
There is also evidence that after so much repeated
testing, parsers are indirectly over-fitting to this set
(Petrov and Klein, 2007). Furthermore, parsing was
never meant as a stand-alone task, but is rather a
means to an end, towards the goal of building sys-
tems that can process natural language input.
This is not to say that parsers are not used in larger
systems. All to the contrary, as parsing technology
has become more mature, parsers have become ef-
ficient and accurate enough to be useful in many
natural language processing systems, most notably
in machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001;
Galley et al, 2004; Xu et al, 2009). While it has
been repeatedly shown that using a parser can bring
net gains on downstream application quality, it is of-
ten unclear how much intrinsic parsing accuracy ac-
tually matters.
In this paper we try to shed some light on this is-
sue by comparing different parsers in the context of
machine translation (MT). We present experiments
on translation from English to three Subject-Object-
Verb (SOV) languages,1 because those require ex-
tensive syntactic reordering to produce grammatical
translations. We evaluate parse quality on a num-
ber of extrinsic metrics, including word reordering
accuracy, BLEU score and a human evaluation of fi-
nal translation quality. We show that while there is
a good correlation between those extrinsic metrics,
parsing quality as measured on the Penn Treebank
is not a good indicator of the final downstream ap-
plication quality. Since the word reordering metric
can be computed efficiently offline (i.e. without the
use of the final MT system), we then propose to tune
parsers specifically for that metric, with the goal of
improving the performance of the overall system.
To this end we propose a simple training regime
1We experiment with Japanese, Korean and Turkish, but
there is nothing language specific in our approach.
183
which we refer to as targeted self-training (Sec-
tion 2). Similar to self-training, a baseline model
is used to produce predictions on an unlabeled data
set. However, rather than directly training on the
output of the baseline model, we generate a list of
hypotheses and use an external signal to select the
best candidate. The selected parse trees are added
to the training data and the model is then retrained.
The experiments in Section 5 show that this simple
procedure noticeably improves our parsers for the
task at hand, resulting in significant improvements
in downstream translation quality, as measured in a
human evaluation on web text.
This idea is similar in vein to McClosky. et al
(2006) and Petrov et al (2010), except that we use an
extrinsic quality metric instead of a second parsing
model for making the selection. It is also similar to
Burkett and Klein (2008) and Burkett et al (2010),
but again avoiding the added complexity introduced
by the use of additional (bilingual) models for can-
didate selection.
It should be noted that our extrinsic metric is com-
puted from data that has been manually annotated
with reference word reorderings. Details of the re-
ordering metric and the annotated data we used are
given in Sections 3 and 4. While this annotation re-
quires some effort, such annotations are much easier
to obtain than full parse trees. In our experiments
in Section 6 we show that we can obtain similar
improvements on downstream translation quality by
targeted self-training with weakly labeled data (in
form of word reorderings), as with training on the
fully labeled data (with full syntactic parse trees).
2 Targeted Self-Training
Our technique for retraining a baseline parser is an
extension of self-training. In standard parser self-
training, one uses the baseline parsing model to
parse a corpus of sentences, and then adds the 1-best
output of the baseline parser to the training data. To
target the self-training, we introduce an additional
step, given as Algorithm 1. Instead of taking the 1-
best parse, we produce a ranked n-best list of predic-
tions and select the parser which gives the best score
according to an external evaluation function. That
is, instead of relying on the intrinsic model score,
we use an extrinsic score to select the parse towards
Algorithm 1 Select parse that maximizes an extrin-
sic metric.
Input: baseline parser B
Input: sentence S
Input: function COMPUTEEXTRINSIC(parse P )
Output: a parse for the input sentence
Pn = {P1, . . . , Pn} ? n-best parses of S by B
maxScore = 0
bestParse = ?
for k = 1 to n do
extrinsicScore = COMPUTEEXTRINSIC(Pk)
if extrinsicScore > maxScore then
maxScore = extrinsicScore
bestParse = Pk
end if
end for
return bestParse
which to update. In the case of a tie, we prefer the
parse ranked most highly in the n-best list.
The motivation of this selection step is that good
performance on the downstream external task, mea-
sured by the extrinsic metric, should be predictive
of an intrinsically good parse. At the very least,
even if the selected parse is not syntactically cor-
rect, or even if it goes against the original treebank-
ing guidelines, it results in a higher extrinsic score
and should therefore be preferred.
One could imagine extending this framework by
repeatedly running self-training on successively im-
proving parsers in an EM-style algorithm. A recent
work by Hall et al (2011) on training a parser with
multiple objective functions investigates a similar
idea in the context of online learning.
In this paper we focus our attention on machine
translation as the final application, but one could en-
vision applying our techniques to other applications
such as information extraction or question answer-
ing. In particular, we explore one application of
targeted self-training, where computing the extrin-
sic metric involves plugging the parse into an MT
system?s reordering component and computing the
accuracy of the reordering compared to a reference
word order. We now direct our attention to the de-
tails of this application.
184
3 The MT Reordering Task
Determining appropriate target language word or-
der for a translation is a fundamental problem in
MT. When translating between languages with sig-
nificantly different word order such as English and
Japanese, it has been shown that metrics which ex-
plicitly account for word-order are much better cor-
related with human judgments of translation qual-
ity than those that give more weight to word choice,
like BLEU (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009; Isozaki et
al., 2010a; Birch and Osborne, 2010). This demon-
strates the importance of getting reordering right.
3.1 Reordering as a separately evaluable
component
One way to break down the problem of translat-
ing between languages with different word order
is to handle reordering and translation separately:
first reorder source-language sentences into target-
language word order in a preprocessing step, and
then translate the reordered sentences. It has been
shown that good results can be achieved by reorder-
ing each input sentence using a series of tree trans-
formations on its parse tree. The rules for tree
transformation can be manually written (Collins et
al., 2005; Wang, 2007; Xu et al, 2009) or auto-
matically learned (Xia and McCord, 2004; Habash,
2007; Genzel, 2010).
Doing reordering as a preprocessing step, sepa-
rately from translation, makes it easy to evaluate re-
ordering performance independently from the MT
system. Accordingly, Talbot et al (2011) present a
framework for evaluating the quality of reordering
separately from the lexical choice involved in trans-
lation. They propose a simple reordering metric
based on METEOR?s reordering penalty (Lavie and
Denkowski, 2009). This metric is computed solely
on the source language side. To compute it, one
takes the candidate reordering of the input sentence
and partitions it into a set C of contiguous spans
whose content appears contiguously in the same or-
der in the reference. The reordering score is then
computed as
?(esys, eref) = 1?
|C| ? 1
|e| ? 1 .
This metric assigns a score between 0 and 1 where 1
indicates that the candidate reordering is identical to
the reference and 0 indicates that no two words that
are contiguous in the candidate reordering are con-
tiguous in the reference. For example, if a reference
reordering is A B C D E, candidate reordering A
B E C D would get score 1?(3?1)/(5?1) = 0.5.
Talbot et al (2011) show that this reordering score
is strongly correlated with human judgment of trans-
lation quality. Furthermore, they propose to evalu-
ate the reordering quality of an MT system by com-
puting its reordering score on a test set consisting
of source language sentences and their reference re-
orderings. In this paper, we take the same approach
for evaluation, and in addition, we use corpora of
source language sentences and their reference re-
orderings for training the system, not just testing
it. We describe in more detail how the reference re-
ordering data was prepared in Section 4.1.
3.2 Reordering quality as predictor of parse
quality
Figure 1 gives concrete examples of good and bad
reorderings of an English sentence into Japanese
word order. It shows that a bad parse leads to a bad
reordering (lacking inversion of verb ?wear? and ob-
ject ?sunscreen?) and a low reordering score. Could
we flip this causality around, and perhaps try to iden-
tify a good parse tree based on its reordering score?
With the experiments in this paper, we show that in-
deed a high reordering score is predictive of the un-
derlying parse tree that was used to generate the re-
ordering being a good parse (or, at least, being good
enough for our purpose).
In the case of translating English to Japanese or
another SOV language, there is a large amount of
reordering required, but with a relatively small num-
ber of reordering rules one can cover a large pro-
portion of reordering phenomena. Isozaki et al
(2010b), for instance, were able to get impressive
English?Japanese results with only a single re-
ordering rule, given a suitable definition of a head.
Hence, the reordering task depends crucially on a
correct syntactic analysis and is extremely sensitive
to parser errors.
185
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Treebank data
In our experiments the baseline training corpus is
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn
Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) using standard train-
ing/development/testing splits. We converted the
treebank to match the tokenization expected by our
MT system. In particular, we split tokens containing
hyphens into multiple tokens and, somewhat sim-
plistically, gave the original token?s part-of-speech
tag to all newly created tokens. In Section 6 we
make also use of the Question Treebank (QTB)
(Judge et al, 2006), as a source of syntactically an-
notated out-of-domain data. Though we experiment
with both dependency parsers and phrase structure
parsers, our MT system assumes dependency parses
as input. We use the Stanford converter (de Marneffe
et al, 2006) to convert phrase structure parse trees to
dependency parse trees (for both treebank trees and
predicted trees).
4.2 Reference reordering data
We aim to build an MT system that can accurately
translate typical English text that one finds on the
Internet to SOV langauges. To this end, we ran-
domly sampled 13595 English sentences from the
web and created Japanese-word-order reference re-
orderings for them. We split the sentences arbitrarily
into a 6268-sentence Web-Train corpus and a 7327-
sentence Web-Test corpus.
To make the reference alignments we used the
technique suggested by Talbot et al (2011): ask
annotators to translate each English sentence to
Japanese extremely literally and annotate which En-
glish words align to which Japanese words. Golden
reference reorderings can be made programmati-
cally from these annotations. Creating a large set
of reference reorderings is straightforward because
annotators need little special background or train-
ing, as long as they can speak both the source and
target languages. We chose Japanese as the target
language through which to create the English refer-
ence reorderings because we had access to bilingual
annotators fluent in English and Japanese.
Good parse
Reordered:
15 or greater of an SPF has that sunscreen Wear
Reordering score: 1.0 (matches reference)
Bad parse
Reordered:
15 or greater of an SPF has that Wear sunscreen
Reordering score: 0.78 (?Wear? is out of place)
Figure 1: Examples of good and bad parses and cor-
responding reorderings for translation from English to
Japanese. The good parse correctly identifies ?Wear? as
the main verb and moves it to the end of the sentence; the
bad parse analyses ?Wear sunscreen? as a noun phrase
and does not reorder it. This example was one of the
wins in the human evaluation of Section 5.2.
4.3 Parsers
The core dependency parser we use is an implemen-
tation of a transition-based dependency parser using
an arc-eager transition strategy (Nivre, 2008). The
parser is trained using the averaged perceptron algo-
rithm with an early update strategy as described in
Zhang and Clark (2008). The parser uses the fol-
lowing features: word identity of the first two words
on the buffer, the top word on the stack and the head
of the top word on the stack (if available); part-of-
speech identities of the first four words on the buffer
and top two words on the stack; dependency arc la-
bel identities for the top word on the stack, the left
and rightmost modifier of the top word on the stack,
and the leftmost modifier of the first word in the
buffer. We also include conjunctions over all non-
lexical features.
We also give results for the latent variable parser
(a.k.a. BerkeleyParser) of Petrov et al (2006). We
convert the constituency trees output by the Berke-
leyParser to labeled dependency trees using the same
procedure that is applied to the treebanks.
While the BerkeleyParser views part-of-speech
(POS) tagging as an integral part of parsing, our
dependency parser requires the input to be tagged
186
with a separate POS tagger. We use the TnT tag-
ger (Brants, 2000) in our experiments, because of
its efficiency and ease of use. Tagger and parser are
always trained on the same data.
For all parsers, we lowercase the input at train and
test time. We found that this improves performance
in parsing web text. In addition to general upper-
case/lowercase noisiness of the web text negatively
impacting scores, we found that the baseline case-
sensitive parsers are especially bad at parsing imper-
ative sentences, as discussed in Section 5.3.2.
4.4 Reordering rules
In this paper we focus on English to Japanese, Ko-
rean, and Turkish translation. We use a superset of
the reordering rules proposed by Xu et al (2009),
which flatten a dependency tree into SOV word or-
der that is suitable for all three languages. The rules
define a precedence order for the dependents of each
part of speech. For example, a slightly simplified
version of the precedence order of child labels for
a verbal head HEADVERB is: advcl, nsubj, prep,
[other children], dobj, prt, aux, neg, HEADVERB,
mark, ref, compl.
Alternatively, we could have used an automatic
reordering-rule learning framework like that of Gen-
zel (2010). Because the reordering accuracy met-
ric can be computed for any source/target language
pair, this would have made our approach language
completely independent and applicable to any lan-
guage pair. We chose to use manually written rules
to eliminate the variance induced by the automatic
reordering-rule learning framework.
4.5 MT system
We carried out all our translation experiments on a
state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system.
During both training and testing, the system reorders
source-language sentences in a preprocessing step
using the above-mentioned rules. During decoding,
we used an allowed jump width of 4 words. In ad-
dition to the regular distance distortion model, we
incorporate a maximum entropy based lexicalized
phrase reordering model (Zens and Ney, 2006) as
a feature used in decoding.
Overall for decoding, we use between 20 to
30 features, whose weights are optimized using
MERT (Och, 2003). All experiments for a given lan-
guage pair use the same set of MERT weights tuned
on a system using a separate parser (that is neither
the baseline nor the experiment parser). This po-
tentially underestimates the improvements that can
be obtained, but also eliminates MERT as a pos-
sible source of improvement, allowing us to trace
back improvements in translation quality directly to
parser changes.2
For parallel training data, we use a custom collec-
tion of parallel documents. They come from vari-
ous sources with a substantial portion coming from
the web after using simple heuristics to identify po-
tential document pairs. For all language pairs, we
trained on approximately 300 million source words
each.
5 Experiments Reordering Web Text
We experimented with parsers trained in three dif-
ferent ways:
1. Baseline: trained only on WSJ-Train.
2. Standard self-training: trained on WSJ-Train
and 1-best parse of the Web-Train set by base-
line parser.
3. Targeted self-training: trained on WSJ-Train
and, for each sentence in Web-Train, the parse
from the baseline parser?s 512-best list that
when reordered gives the highest reordering
score.3
5.1 Standard self-training vs targeted
self-training
Table 1 shows that targeted self-training on Web-
Train significantly improves Web-Test reordering
score more than standard self-training for both the
shift-reduce parser and for the BerkeleyParser. The
reordering score is generally divorced from the at-
tachment scores measured on the WSJ-Test tree-
bank: for the shift-reduce parser, Web-Test reorder-
ing score and WSJ-Test labeled attachment score
2We also ran MERT on all systems and the pattern of im-
provement is consistent, but sometimes the improvement is big-
ger or smaller after MERT. For instance, the BLEU delta for
Japanese is +0.0030 with MERT on both sides as opposed to
+0.0025 with no MERT.
3We saw consistent but diminishing improvements as we in-
creased the size of the n-best list.

(LAS) are anti-correlated, but for BerkeleyParser
they are correlated. Interestingly, weighting the self-
training data more seems to have a negative effect on
both metrics.4
One explanation for the drops in LAS is that some
parts of the parse tree are important for downstream
reordering quality while others are not (or only to
a lesser extent). Some distinctions between labels
become less important; for example, arcs labeled
?amod? and ?advmod? are transformed identically
by the reordering rules. Some semantic distinctions
also become less important; for example, any sane
interpretation of ?red hot car? would be reordered
the same, that is, not at all.
5.2 Translation quality improvement
To put the improvement of the MT system in terms
of BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002), a widely used
metric for automatic MT evaluation, we took 5000
sentences from Web-Test and had humans gener-
ate reference translations into Japanese, Korean, and
4We did not attempt this experiment for the BerkeleyParser
since training was too slow.
Turkish. We then trained MT systems varying only
the parser used for reordering in training and decod-
ing. Table 2 shows that targeted self-training data
increases BLEU score for translation into all three
languages.
In addition to BLEU increase, a side-by-side hu-
man evaluation on 500 sentences (sampled from
the 5000 used to compute BLEU scores) showed
a statistically significant improvement for all three
languages (see again Table 2). For each sen-
tence, we asked annotators to simultaneously score
both translations from 0 to 6, with guidelines
that 6=?Perfect?, 4=?Most Meaning/Grammar?,
2=?Some Meaning/Grammar?, 0=?Nonsense?. We
computed confidence intervals for the average score
difference using bootstrap resampling; a difference
is significant if the two-sided confidence interval
does not include 0.
5.3 Analysis
As the divergence between the labeled attachment
score on the WSJ-Test data and the reordering score
on the WSJ-Test data indicates, parsing web text
188

(WSJ-Train) 1 0 0.7%
Table 3: Counts on Web-Test of ?click? tagged as a noun and verb and percentage of sentences parsed imperatively.
poses very different challenges compared to parsing
newswire. We show how our method improves pars-
ing performance and reordering performance on two
examples: the trendy word ?click? and imperative
sentences.
5.3.1 Click
The word ?click? appears only once in the train-
ing portion of the WSJ (as a noun), but appears many
times in our Web test data. Table 3 shows the distri-
bution of part-of-speech tags that different parsers
assign to ?click?. The WSJ-only parsers tag ?click?
as a noun far too frequently. The WSJ-only shift-
reduce parser refuses to tag ?click? as a verb even
with targeted self-training, but BerkeleyParser does
learn to tag ?click? more often as a verb.
It turns out that the shift-reduce parser?s stub-
bornness is not due to a fundamental problem of
the parser, but due to an artifact in TnT. To in-
crease speed, TnT restricts the choices of tags for
known words to previously-seen tags. This causes
the parser?s n-best lists to never hypothesize ?click?
as a verb, and self-training doesn?t click no matter
how targeted it is. This shows that the targeted self-
training approach heavily relies on the diversity of
the baseline parser?s n-best lists.
It should be noted here that it would be easy to
combine our approach with the uptraining approach
of Petrov et al (2010). The idea would be to use the
BerkeleyParser to generate the n-best lists; perhaps
we could call this targeted uptraining. This way, the
shift-reduce parser could benefit both from the gen-
erally higher quality of the parse trees produced by
the BerkeleyParser, as well as from the information
provided by the extrinsic scoring function.
5.3.2 Imperatives
As Table 3 shows, the WSJ training set contains
only 0.7% imperative sentences.5 In contrast, our
test sentences from the web contain approximately
10% imperatives. As a result, parsers trained exclu-
sively on the WSJ underproduce imperative parses,
especially a case-sensitive version of the baseline.
Targeted self-training helps the parsers to predict im-
perative parses more often.
Targeted self-training works well for generating
training data with correctly-annotated imperative
constructions because the reordering of main sub-
jects and verbs in an SOV language like Japanese
is very distinct: main subjects stay at the begin-
ning of the sentence, and main verbs are reordered
to the end of the sentence. It is thus especially easy
to know whether an imperative parse is correct or
not by looking at the reference reordering. Figure 1
gives an example: the bad (WSJ-only) parse doesn?t
catch on to the imperativeness and gets a low re-
ordering score.
6 Targeted Self-Training vs Training on
Treebanks for Domain Adaptation
If task-specific annotation is cheap, then it is rea-
sonable to consider whether we could use targeted
self-training to adapt a parser to a new domain as
a cheaper alternative to making new treebanks. For
example, if we want to build a parser that can reorder
question sentences better than our baseline WSJ-
only parser, we have these two options:
1. Manually construct PTB-style trees for 2000
5As an approximation, we count every parse that begins with
a root verb as an imperative.
189
questions and train on the resulting treebank.
2. Create reference reorderings for 2000 questions
and then do targeted self-training.
To compare these approaches, we created reference
reordering data for our train (2000 sentences) and
test (1000 sentences) splits of the Question Tree-
bank (Judge et al, 2006). Table 4 shows that both
ways of training on QTB-Train sentences give sim-
ilarly large improvements in reordering score on
QTB-Test. Table 5 confirms that this corresponds
to very large increases in English?Japanese BLEU
score and subjective translation quality. In the hu-
man side-by-side comparison, the baseline transla-
tions achieved an average score of 2.12, while the
targeted self-training translations received a score of
2.94, where a score of 2 corresponds to ?some mean-
ing/grammar? and ?4? corresponds to ?most mean-
ing/grammar?.
But which of the two approaches is better? In
the shift-reduce parser, targeted self-training gives
higher reordering scores than training on the tree-
bank, and in BerkeleyParser, the opposite is true.
Thus both approaches produce similarly good re-
sults. From a practical perspective, the advantage of
targeted self-training depends on whether the extrin-
sic metric is cheaper to calculate than treebanking.
For MT reordering, making reference reorderings is
cheap, so targeted self-training is relatively advanta-
geous.
As before, we can examine whether labeled at-
tachment score measured on the test set of the
QTB is predictive of reordering quality. Table 4
shows that targeted self-training raises LAS from
64.78?69.17%. But adding the treebank leads
to much larger increases, resulting in an LAS of
84.75%, without giving higher reordering score. We
can conclude that high LAS is not necessary to
achieve top reordering scores.
Perhaps our reordering rules are somehow defi-
cient when it comes to reordering correctly-parsed
questions, and as a result the targeted self-training
process steers the parser towards producing patho-
logical trees with little intrinsic meaning. To explore
this possibility, we computed reordering scores after
reordering the QTB-Test treebank trees directly. Ta-
ble 4 shows that this gives reordering scores similar
to those of our best parsers. Therefore it is at least
possible that the targeted self-training process could
have resulted in a parser that achieves high reorder-
ing score by producing parses that look like those in
the QuestionBank.
7 Related Work
Our approach to training parsers for reordering is
closely related to self/up-training (McClosky. et al,
2006; Petrov et al, 2010). However, unlike uptrain-
ing, our method does not use only the 1-best output
of the first-stage parser, but has access to the n-best
list. This makes it similar to the work of McClosky.
et al (2006), except that we use an extrinsic metric
(MT reordering score) to select a high quality parse
tree, rather than a second, reranking model that has
access to additional features.
Targeted self-training is also similar to the re-
training of Burkett et al (2010) in which they
jointly parse unannotated bilingual text using a mul-
tiview learning objective, then retrain the monolin-
gual parser models to include each side of the jointly
parsed bitext as monolingual training data. Our ap-
proach is different in that it doesn?t use a second
parser and bitext to guide the creation of new train-
ing data, and instead relies on n-best lists and an
extrinsic metric.
Our method can be considered an instance of
weakly or distantly supervised structured prediction
(Chang et al, 2007; Chang et al, 2010; Clarke et al,
2010; Ganchev et al, 2010). Those methods attempt
to learn structure models from related external sig-
nals or aggregate data statistics. This work differs
in two respects. First, we use the external signals
not as explicit constraints, but to compute an ora-
cle score used to re-rank a set of parses. As such,
there are no requirements that it factor by the struc-
ture of the parse tree and can in fact be any arbitrary
metric. Second, our final objective is different. In
weakly/distantly supervised learning, the objective
is to use external knowledge to build better struc-
tured predictors. In our case this would mean using
the reordering metric as a means to train better de-
pendency parsers. Our objective, on the other hand,
is to use the extrinsic metric to train parsers that are
specifically better at the reordering task, and, as a re-
sult, better suited for MT. This makes our work more
in the spirit of Liang et al (2006), who train a per-

ceptron model for an end-to-end MT system where
the alignment parameters are updated based on se-
lecting an alignment from a n-best list that leads to
highest BLEU score. As mentioned earlier, this also
makes our work similar to Hall et al (2011) who
train a perceptron algorithm on multiple objective
functions with the goal of producing parsers that are
optimized for extrinsic metrics.
It has previously been observed that parsers of-
ten perform differently for downstream applications.
Miyao et al (2008) compared parser quality in the
biomedical domain using a protein-protein interac-
tion (PPI) identification accuracy metric. This al-
lowed them to compare the utility of extant depen-
dency parsers, phrase structure parsers, and deep
structure parsers for the PPI identification task. One
could apply the targeted self-training technique we
describe to optimize any of these parsers for the PPI
task, similar to how we have optimized our parser
for the MT reordering task.
8 Conclusion
We introduced a variant of self-training that targets
parser training towards an extrinsic evaluation met-
ric. We use this targeted self-training approach to
train parsers that improve the accuracy of the word
reordering component of a machine translation sys-
tem. This significantly improves the subjective qual-
ity of the system?s translations from English into
three SOV languages. While the new parsers give
improvements in these external evaluations, their in-
trinsic attachment scores go down overall compared
to baseline parsers trained only on treebanks. We
conclude that when using a parser as a component
of a larger external system, it can be advantageous
to incorporate an extrinsic metric into parser train-
ing and evaluation, and that targeted self-training is
an effective technique for incorporating an extrinsic
metric into parser training.

Abstract
Reordering is a major challenge for machine
translation between distant languages. Recent
work has shown that evaluation metrics that
explicitly account for target language word or-
der correlate better with human judgments of
translation quality. Here we present a simple
framework for evaluating word order indepen-
dently of lexical choice by comparing the sys-
tem?s reordering of a source sentence to ref-
erence reordering data generated from manu-
ally word-aligned translations. When used to
evaluate a system that performs reordering as
a preprocessing step our framework allows the
parser and reordering rules to be evaluated ex-
tremely quickly without time-consuming end-
to-end machine translation experiments. A
novelty of our approach is that the translations
used to generate the reordering reference data
are generated in an alignment-oriented fash-
ion. We show that how the alignments are
generated can significantly effect the robust-
ness of the evaluation. We also outline some
ways in which this framework has allowed our
group to analyze reordering errors for English
to Japanese machine translation.
1 Introduction
Statistical machine translation systems can perform
poorly on distant language pairs such as English
and Japanese. Reordering errors are a major source
of poor or misleading translations in such systems
(Isozaki et al, 2010). Unfortunately the stan-
dard evaluation metrics used by the statistical ma-
chine translation community are relatively insensi-
tive to the long-distance reordering phenomena en-
countered when translating between such languages
(Birch et al, 2010).
The ability to rapidly evaluate the impact of
changes on a system can significantly accelerate the
experimental cycle. In a large statistical machine
translation system, we should ideally be able to ex-
periment with separate components without retrain-
ing the complete system. Measures such as per-
plexity have been successfully used to evaluate lan-
guage models independently in speech recognition
eliminating some of the need for end-to-end speech
recognition experiments. In machine translation,
alignment error rate has been used with some mixed
success to evaluate word-alignment algorithms but
no standard evaluation frameworks exist for other
components of a machine translation system (Fraser
and Marcu, 2007).
Unfortunately, BLEU (Papineni et al, 2001) and
other metrics that work with the final output of a ma-
chine translation system are both insensitive to re-
ordering phenomena and relatively time-consuming
to compute: changes to the system may require the
realignment of the parallel training data, extraction
of phrasal statistics and translation of a test set. As
training sets grow in size, the cost of end-to-end ex-
perimentation can become significant. However, it is
not clear that measurements made on any single part
of the system will correlate well with human judg-
ments of the translation quality of the whole system.
Following Collins et al (2005a) and Wang (2007),
Xu et al (2009) showed that when translating from
English to Japanese (and to other SOV languages
such as Korean and Turkish) applying reordering as
12
a preprocessing step that manipulates a source sen-
tence parse tree can significantly outperform state-
of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical machine
translation systems. This result is corroborated by
Birch et al (2009) whose results suggest that both
phrase-based and hierarchical translation systems
fail to capture long-distance reordering phenomena.
In this paper we describe a lightweight framework
for measuring the quality of the reordering compo-
nents in a machine translation system. While our
framework can be applied to any translation sys-
tem in which it is possible to derive a token-level
alignment from the input source tokens to the out-
put target tokens, it is of particular practical interest
when applied to a system that performs reordering
as a preprocessing step (Xia and McCord, 2004). In
this case, as we show, it allows for extremely rapid
and sensitive analysis of changes to parser, reorder-
ing rules and other reordering components.
In our framework we evaluate the reordering pro-
posed by a system separately from its choice of tar-
get words by comparing it to a reference reordering
of the sentence generated from a manually word-
aligned translation. Unlike previous work (Isozaki
et al, 2010), our approach does not rely on the sys-
tem?s output matching the reference translation lexi-
cally. This makes the evaluation more robust as there
may be many ways to render a source phrase in the
target language and we would not wish to penalize
one that simply happens not to match the reference.
In the next section we review related work on
reordering for translation between distant language
pairs and automatic approaches to evaluating re-
ordering in machine translation. We then describe
our evaluation framework including certain impor-
tant details of how our reference reorderings were
created. We evaluate the framework by analyz-
ing how robustly it is able to predict improvements
in subjective translation quality for an English to
Japanese machine translation system. Finally, we
describe ways in which the framework has facili-
tated development of the reordering components in
our system.
2 Related Work
2.1 Evaluating Reordering
The ability to automatically evaluate machine trans-
lation output has driven progress in statistical ma-
chine translation; however, shortcomings of the
dominant metric, BLEU (Papineni et al, 2001) , par-
ticularly with respect to reordering, have long been
recognized (Callison-burch and Osborne, 2006).
Reordering has also been identified as a major fac-
tor in determining the difficulty of statistical ma-
chine translation between two languages (Birch et
al., 2008) hence BLEU scores may be most unreli-
able precisely for those language pairs for which sta-
tistical machine translation is most difficult (Isozaki
et al, 2010).
There have been many results showing that met-
rics that account for reordering are better correlated
with human judgements of translation quality (Lavie
and Denkowski, 2009; Birch and Osborne, 2010;
Isozaki et al, 2010). Examples given in Isozaki et
al. (2010) where object and subject arguments are
reversed in a Japanese to English statistical machine
translation system demonstrate how damaging re-
ordering errors can be and it should therefore not
come as a surprise that word order is a strong pre-
dictor of translation quality; however, there are other
advantages to be gained by focusing on this specific
aspect of the translation process in isolation.
One problem for all automatic evaluation metrics
is that multiple equally good translations can be con-
structed for most input sentences and typically our
reference data will contain only a small fraction of
these. Equally good translations for a sentence may
differ both in terms of lexical choice and word or-
der. One of the potential advantages of designing a
metric that looks only at word order, is that it may,
to some extent, factor out variability along the di-
mension of the lexical choice. Previous work on au-
tomatic evaluation metrics that focus on reordering,
however, has not fully exploited this.
The evaluation metrics proposed in Isozaki et al
(2010) compute a reordering score by comparing
the ordering of unigrams and bigrams that appear
in both the system?s translation and the reference.
These scores are therefore liable to overestimate
the reordering quality of sentences that were poorly
translated. While Isozaki et al (2010) does propose
13
a work-around to this problem which combines the
reordering score with a lexical precision term, this
clearly introduces a bias in the metric whereby poor
translations are evaluated primarily on their lexical
choice and good translations are evaluated more on
the basis of their word order. In our experience
word order is particularly poor in those sentences
that have the lowest lexical overlap with reference
translations; hence we would like to be able to com-
pute the quality of reordering in all sentences inde-
pendently of the quality of their lexical choice.
Birch and Osborne (2010) are closer to our ap-
proach in that they use word alignments to induce a
permutation over the source sentence. They com-
pare a source-side permutation generated from a
word alignment of the reference translation with one
generated from the system?s using various permuta-
tion distances. However, Birch and Osborne (2010)
only demonstrate that these metrics are correlated
with human judgements of translation quality when
combined with BLEU score and hence take lexical
choice into account.
Birch et al (2010) present the only results we
are aware of that compute the correlation be-
tween human judgments of translation quality and
a reordering-only metric independently of lexical
choice. Unfortunately, the experimental set-up there
is somewhat flawed. The authors ?undo? reorderings
in their reference translations by permuting the ref-
erence tokens and presenting the permuted transla-
tions to human raters. While many machine trans-
lation systems (including our own) assume that re-
ordering and translation can be factored into sepa-
rate models, e.g. (Xia and McCord, 2004), and per-
form these two operations in separate steps, the lat-
ter conditioned on the former, Birch et al (2010) are
making a much stronger assumption when they per-
form these simulations: they are assuming that lexi-
cal choice and word order are entirely independent.
It is easy to find cases where this assumption does
not hold and we would in general be very surprised
if a similar change in the reordering component in
our system did not also result in a change in the lex-
ical choice of the system; an effect which their ex-
periments are unable to model.
Another minor difference between our evaluation
framework and (Birch et al, 2010) is that we use
a reordering score that is based on the minimum
number of chunks into which the candidate and ref-
erence permutations can be concatenated similar to
the reordering component of METEOR (Lavie and
Denkowski, 2009). As we show, this is better cor-
related with human judgments of translation quality
than Kendall?s ? . This may be due to the fact that
it counts the number of ?jumps? a human reader has
to make in order to parse the system?s order if they
wish to read the tokens in the reference word order.
Kendall?s ? on the other hand penalizes every pair
of words that are in the wrong order and hence has
a quadratic (all-pairs) flavor which in turn might ex-
plain why Birch et al (2010) found that the square-
root of this quantity was a better predictor of trans-
lation quality.
2.2 Evaluation Reference Data
To create the word-aligned translations from which
we generate our reference reordering data, we used
a novel alignment-oriented translation method. The
method (described in more detail below) seeks
to generate reference reorderings that a machine
translation system might reasonably be expected to
achieve. Fox (2002) has analyzed the extent to
which translations seen in a parallel corpus can be
broken down into clean phrasal units: they found
that most sentence pairs contain examples of re-
ordering that violate phrasal cohesion, i.e. the cor-
responding words in the target language are not
completely contiguous or solely aligned to the cor-
responding source phrase. These reordering phe-
nomena are difficult for current statistical transla-
tion models to learn directly. We therefore deliber-
ately chose to create reference data that avoids these
phenomena as much as possible by having a single
annotator generate both the translation and its word
alignment. Our word-aligned translations are cre-
ated with a bias towards simple phrasal reordering.
Our analysis of the correlation between reorder-
ing scores computed on reference data created from
such alignment-oriented translations with scores
computed on references generated from standard
professional translations of the same sentences sug-
gests that the alignment-oriented translations are
more useful for evaluating a current state-of-the-art
system. We note also that while prior work has con-
jectured that automatically generated alignments are
a suitable replacement for manual alignments in the
14
context of reordering evaluation (Birch et al, 2008),
our results suggest that this is not the case at least for
the language pair we consider, English-Japanese.
3 A Lightweight Reordering Evaluation
We now present our lightweight reordering evalu-
ation framework; this consists of (1) a method for
generating reference reordering data from manual
word-alignments; and (2) a reordering metric for
scoring a sytem?s proposed reordering against this
reference data; and (3) a stand-alone evaluation tool.
3.1 Generating Reference Reordering Data
We follow Birch and Osborne (2010) in using ref-
erence reordering data that consists of permuations
of source sentences in a test set. We generate these
from word alignments of the source sentences to
reference translations. Unlike previous work, how-
ever, we have the same annotator generate both the
reference translation and the word alignment. We
also explicitly encourage the translators to generate
translations that are easy to align even if this does
result in occasionally unnatural translations. For in-
stance in English to Japanese translation we require
that all personal pronouns are translated; these are
often omitted in natural Japanese. We insist that
all but an extremely small set of words (articles and
punctuation for English to Japanese) be aligned. We
also disprefer non-contiguous alignments of a sin-
gle source word and require that all target words be
aligned to at least one source token. In Japanese
this requires deciding how to align particles that
mark syntactic roles; we choose to align these to-
gether with the content word (jiritsu-go) of the cor-
responding constituent (bunsetsu). Asking annota-
tors to translate and perform word alignment on the
same sentence in a single session does not necessar-
ily increase the annotation burden over stand-alone
word alignment since it encourages the creation of
alignment-friendly translations which can be aligned
more rapidly. Annotators need little special back-
ground or training for this task, as long as they can
speak both the source and target languages.
To generate a permutation from word alignments
we rank the source tokens by the position of the first
target token to which they are aligned. If multiple
source tokens are aligned to a single target word
or span we ignore the ordering within these source
spans; this is indicated by braces in Table 2. We
place unaligned source words immediately before
the next aligned source word or at the end of the
sentence if there is none. Table 2 shows the ref-
erence reordering derived from various translations
and word alignments.
3.2 Fuzzy Reordering Score
To evaluate the quality of a system?s reordering
against this reference data we use a simple reorder-
ing metric related to METEOR?s reordering compo-
nent (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) . Given the refer-
ence permutation of the source sentence ?ref and the
system?s reordering of the source sentence ?sys ei-
ther generated directly by a reordering component or
inferred from the alignment between source and tar-
get phrases used in the decoder, we align each word
in ?sys to an instance of itself in ?ref taking the first
unmatched instance of the word if there is more than
one. We then define C to be the number chunks of
contiguously aligned words. If M is the number of
words in the source sentence then the fuzzy reorder-
ing score is computed as,
FRS(?sys, ?ref) = 1?
C ? 1
M ? 1
. (1)
This metric assigns a score between 0 and 1 where
1 indicates that the system?s reordering is identical
to the reference. C has an intuitive interpretation as
the number of times a reader would need to jump in
order to read the system?s reordering of the sentence
in the order proposed by the reference.
3.3 Evaluation Tool
While the framework we propose can be applied to
any machine translation system in which a reorder-
ing of the source sentence can be inferred from the
translation process, it has proven particularly use-
ful applied to a system that performs reordering as
a separate preprocessing step. Such pre-ordering
approaches (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al,
2005b) can be criticized for greedily committing to
a single reordering early in the pipeline but in prac-
tice they have been shown to perform extremely well
on language pairs that require long distance reorder-
ing and have been successfully combined with other
more integrated reordering models (Xu et al, 2009).
15
The performance of a parser-based pre-ordering
component is a function of the reordering rules and
parser; it is therefore desirable that these can be eval-
uated efficiently. Both parser and reordering rules
may be evaluated using end-to-end automatic met-
rics such as BLEU score or in human evaluations.
Parsers may also be evaluated using intrinsic tree-
bank metrics such as labeled accuracy. Unfortu-
nately these metrics are either expensive to compute
or, as we show, unpredictive of improvements in hu-
man perceptions of translation quality.
Having found that the fuzzy reordering score pro-
posed here is well-correlated with changes in human
judgements of translation quality, we established a
stand-alone evaluation tool that takes a set of re-
ordering rules and a parser and computes the re-
ordering scores on a set of reference reorderings.
This has become the most frequently used method
for evaluating changes to the reordering component
in our system and has allowed teams working on
parsing, for instance, to contribute significant im-
provements quite independently.
4 Experimental Set-up
We wish to determine whether our evaluation frame-
work can predict which changes to reordering com-
ponents will result in statistically significant im-
provements in subjective translation quality of the
end-to-end system. To that end we created a num-
ber of systems that differ only in terms of reorder-
ing components (parser and/or reordering rules). We
then analyzed the corpus- and sentence-level corre-
lation of our evaluation metric with judgements of
human translation quality.
Previous work has compared either quite separate
systems, e.g. (Isozaki et al, 2010), or systems that
are artificially different from each other (Birch et al,
2010). There has also been a tendency to measure
corpus-level correlation. We are more interested in
comparing systems that differ in a realistic manner
from one another as would typically be required in
development. We also believe sentence-level cor-
relation is more important than corpus-level corre-
lation since good sentence-level correlation implies
that a metric can be used for detailed analysis of a
system and potentially to optimize it.
4.1 Systems
We carried out all our experiments using a state-of-
the-art phrase-based statistical English-to-Japanese
machine translation system (Och, 2003). Dur-
ing both training and testing, the system reorders
source-language sentences in a preprocessing step
using a set of rules written in the framework pro-
posed by (Xu et al, 2009) that reorder an English
dependency tree into target word order. During de-
coding, we set the reordering window to 4 words.
In addition to the regular distance distortion model,
we incorporate a maximum entropy based lexical-
ized phrase reordering model (Zens and Ney, 2006).
For parallel training data, we use an in-house collec-
tion of parallel documents. These come from vari-
ous sources with a substantial portion coming from
the web after using simple heuristics to identify po-
tential document pairs. We trained our system on
about 300 million source words.
The reordering rules applied to the English de-
pendency tree define a precedence order for the chil-
dren of each head category (a coarse-grained part of
speech). For example, a simplified version of the
precedence order for child labels of a verbal head
HEADVERB is: advcl, nsubj, prep, [other children],
dobj, prt, aux, neg, HEADVERB, mark, ref, compl.
The dependency parser we use is an implementa-
tion of a transition-based dependency parser (Nivre,
2008). The parser is trained using the averaged per-
ceptron algorithm with an early update strategy as
described in Zhang and Clark (2008).
We created five systems using different parsers;
here targeted self-training refers to a training pro-
cedure proposed by Katz-Brown et al (2011) that
uses our reordering metric and separate reference re-
ordering data to pick parses for self-training: an n-
best list of parses is generated for each English sen-
tence for which we have reference reordering data
and the parse tree that results in the highest fuzzy
reordering score is added to our parser?s training set.
Parsers P3, P4 and P5 differ in how that framework
is applied and how much data is used.

? P4 Penn Treebank, perceptron, beam search,

? P5 Penn Treebank, perceptron, beam search,

sitive
We also created five systems using the fifth parser
(P5) but with different sets of reordering rules:
? R1 No reordering
? R2 Reverse reordering
? R3 Head final reordering with reverse reorder-
ing for words before the head
? R4 Head final reordering with reverse reorder-
ing for words after the head
? R5 Superset of rules from (Xu et al, 2009)
Reverse reordering places words in the reverse of the
English order. Head final reordering moves the head
of each dependency after all its children. Rules in R3
and R4 overlap significantly with the rules for noun
and verb subtrees respectively in R5. Otherwise all
systems were identical. The rules in R5 have been
extensively hand-tuned while R1 and R2 are rather
naive. System P5R5 was our best performing system
at the time these experiments were conducted.
We refer to systems by a combination of parser
and reordering rules set identifiers, for instance, sys-
tem P2R5, uses parser P2 with reordering rules R5.
We conducted two subjective evaluations in which
bilingual human raters were asked to judge trans-
lations on a scale from 0 to 6 where 0 indicates
nonsense and 6 is perfect. The first experiment
(Parsers) contrasted systems with different parsers
and the second (Rules) varied the reordering rules.
In each case three bilingual evaluators were shown
the source sentence and the translations produced by
all five systems.
4.2 Meta-analysis
We perform a meta-analysis of the following metrics
and the framework by computing correlations with
the results of these subjective evaluations of transla-
tion quality:
1. Evaluation metrics: BLEU score on final trans-
lations, Kendall?s ? and fuzzy reordering score
on reference reordering data
2. Evaluation data: both manually-generated and
automatically-generated word alignments on
both standard professional and alignment-
oriented translations of the test sentences
The automatic word alignments were generated us-
ing IBM Model 1 in order to avoid directional biases
that higher-order models such as HMMs have.
Results presented in square parentheses are 95
percent confidence intervals estimated by bootstrap
resampling on the test corpus (Koehn, 2004).
Our test set contains 500 sentences randomly
sampled from the web. We have both professional
and alignment-friendly translations for these sen-
tences. We created reference reorderings for this
data using the method described in Section 3.1.
The lack of a broad domain and publically avail-
able Japanese test corpus makes the use of this non-
standard test set unfortunately unavoidable.
The human raters were presented with the source
sentence, the human reference translation and the
translations of the various systems simultaneously,
blind and in a random order. Each rater was allowed
to rate no more than 3 percent of the sentences and
three ratings were elicited for each sentence. Rat-
ings were a single number between 0 and 6 where 0
indicates nonsense and 6 indicates a perfectly gram-
matical translation of the source sentence.
5 Results
Table 2 shows four reference reorderings generated
from various translations and word alignments. The
automatic alignments are significantly sparser than
the manual ones but in these examples the refer-
ence reorderings still seem reasonable. Note how the
alignment-oriented translation includes a pronoun
(translation for ?I?) that is dropped in the slightly
more natural standard translation to Japanese.
Table 1 shows the human judgements of transla-
tion quality for the 10 systems (note that P5R5 ap-
pears in both experiments but was scored differently
as human judgments are affected by which other
translations are present in an experiment). There is a
clear ordering of the systems in each experiment and

we see that both the choice of parser and reordering
rules clearly effects subjective translation quality.
We performed pairwise significance tests using
bootstrap resampling for each pair of ?improved?
systems in each experiment. Tables 3, 4 and 5
shows which pairs were judged to be statistically
significant improvements at either 95 or 90 percent
level under the different metrics. These tests were
computed on the same 500 sentences. All pairs
but one are judged to be statistically significant im-
provements in subjective translation quality. Sig-
nificance tests performed using the fuzzy reorder-
ing metric are identical to the subjective scores for
the Parsers experiment but differ on one pairwise
comparison for the Rules experiment. According to
BLEU score, however, none of the parser changes
are significant at the 95 percent level and only one
pairwise comparison (between the two most differ-
ent systems) was significant at the 90 percent level.
BLEU score appears more sensitive to the larger
changes in the Rules experiment but is still in dis-
agreement with the results of the human evaluation
on four pairwise comparisons.
Table 6 shows the sentence-level correlation of
different metrics with human judgments of transla-

tion whatsoever. These lightweight metrics are also
more correlated with subjective quality than BLEU
score at the sentence level.
Table 7 shows how the correlation between fuzzy
reordering score and subjective translation quality
degrades as we move from manual to automatic
alignments and from alignment-oriented translations
to standard ones. The automatically aligned refer-
ences, in particular, are less correlated with subjec-
tive translation scores then BLEU; we believe this
may be due to the poor quality of word alignments
for languages such as English and Japanese due to
the long-distance reordering between them.
Finally we present some intrinsic evaluation met-
rics for the parsers used in the first of our experi-
ments. Table 8 demonstrates that certain changes
may not be best captured by standard parser bench-
marks. While the first four parser models improve
on the WSJ benchmarks as they improve subjective
translation quality the best parser according to sub-
jective translation qualtiy (P5) is actually the worst
under both metrics on the treebank data. We con-
jecture that this is due to the fact that P5 (unlike the
other parsers) is case insensitive. While this helps us
significantly on our test set drawn from the web, it

6 Discussion
We have found that in practice this evaluation frame-
work is sufficiently correlated with human judg-
ments of translation quality to be rather useful for
performing detailed error analysis of our English-to-
Japanese system. We have used it in the following
ways in simple error analysis sessions:
? To identify which words are most frequently re-
ordered incorrectly
? To identify systematic parser and/or POS errors
? To identify the worst reordered sentences
? To evaluate individual reordering rules

with their resulting reorderings and scores against

ing (using R5 ruleset) and fuzzy score.
the reference. These are typical of the parser er-
rors that impact reordering and which are correctly
identified by our framework. In related joint work
(Katz-Brown et al, 2011) and (Hall et al, 2011), it
is shown that the framework can be used to optimize
reordering components automatically.
7 Conclusions
We have presented a lightweight framework for eval-
uating reordering in machine translation and demon-
strated that this is able to accurately distinguish sig-
nificant changes in translation quality due to changes
in preprocessing components such as the parser or
reordering rules used by the system. The sentence-
level correlation of our metric with judgements of
human translation quality was shown to be higher
than other standard evaluation metrics while our
evaluation has the significant practical advantage of
not requiring an end-to-end machine translation ex-
periment when used to evaluate a separate reorder-
ing component. Our analysis has also highlighted
the benefits of creating focused evaluation data that
attempts to factor out some of the phenomena found
in real human translation. While previous work has
provided meta-analysis of reordering metrics across
quite independent systems, ours is we believe the
first to provide a detailed comparison of systems
20
that differ only in small but realistic aspects such as
parser quality. In future work we plan to use the
framework to provide a more comprehensive analy-
sis of the reordering capabilities of a broad range of
machine translation systems.
