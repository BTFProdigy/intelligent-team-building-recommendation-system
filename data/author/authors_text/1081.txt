Abstract
We investigate Global Index Gram-
mars (GIGs), a grammar formalism
that uses a stack of indices associated
with productions and has restricted
context-sensitive power. We discuss
some of the structural descriptions
that GIGs can generate compared with
those generated by LIGs. We show
also how GIGs can represent structural
descriptions corresponding to HPSGs
(Pollard and Sag, 1994) schemas.
1 Introduction
The notion of Mildly context-sensitivity was in-
troduced in (Joshi, 1985) as a possible model
to express the required properties of formalisms
that might describe Natural Language (NL)
phenomena. It requires three properties:1 a)
constant growth property (or the stronger semi-
linearity property); b) polynomial parsability;
c) limited cross-serial dependencies, i.e. some
limited context-sensitivity. The canonical NL
problems which exceed context free power are:
multiple agreements, reduplication, crossing de-
pendencies.2
Mildly Context-sensitive Languages (MCSLs)
have been characterized by a geometric hierar-
chy of grammar levels. A level-2 MCSL (eg.
1See for example, (Joshi et al, 1991), (Weir, 1988).
2However other phenomena (e.g. scrambling, Geor-
gian Case and Chinese numbers) might be considered to
be beyond certain mildly context-sensitive formalisms.
TALs/LILs) is able to capture up to 4 counting
dependencies (includes L4 = {anbncndn |n ? 1}
but not L5 = {anbncndnen |n ? 1}). They were
proven to have recognition algorithms with time
complexity O(n6 ) (Satta, 1994). In general for
a level-k MCSL the recognition problem is in
O(n3 ?2 k?1 ) and the descriptive power regard-
ing counting dependencies is 2k (Weir, 1988).
Even the descriptive power of level-2 MCSLs
(Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs), Linear In-
dexed Grammars (LIGs), Combinatory Catego-
rial Grammars (CCGs) might be considered in-
sufficient for some NL problems, therefore there
have been many proposals3 to extend or modify
them. On our view the possibility of modeling
coordination phenomena is probably the most
crucial in this respect.
In (Castan?o, 2003) we introduced Global In-
dex Grammars (GIGs) - and GILs the corre-
sponding languages - as an alternative grammar
formalism that has a restricted context sensitive
power. We showed that GIGs have enough de-
scriptive power to capture the three phenomena
mentioned above (reduplication, multiple agree-
ments, crossed agreements) in their generalized
forms. Recognition of the language generated by
a GIG is in bounded polynomial time: O(n6 ).
We presented a Chomsky-Schu?tzenberger repre-
sentation theorem for GILs. In (Castan?o, 2003c)
we presented the equivalent automaton model:
LR-2PDA and provided a characterization the-

CCGs, IGs, and many other proposals that would be
impossible to mention here.
orems of GILs in terms of the LR-2PDA and
GIGs. The family of GILs is an Abstract Fam-
ily of Language.
The goal of this paper is to show the relevance
of GIGs for NL modeling and processing. This
should not be understood as claim to propose
GIGs as a grammar model with ?linguistic con-
tent? that competes with grammar models such
as HPSG or LFG. It should be rather seen as
a formal language resource which can be used
to model and process NL phenomena beyond
context free, or beyond the level-2 MCSLs (like
those mentioned above) or to compile grammars
created in other framework into GIGs. LIGs
played a similar role to model the treatment of
the SLASH feature in GPSGs and HPSGs, and
to compile TAGs for parsing. GIGs offer addi-
tional descriptive power as compared to LIGs
or TAGs regarding the canonical NL problems
mentioned above, and the same computational
cost in terms of asymptotic complexity. They
also offer additional descriptive power in terms
of the structural descriptions they can generate
for the same set of string languages, being able
to produce dependent paths.4
This paper is organized as follows: section 2
reviews Global Index Grammars and their prop-
erties and we give examples of its weak descrip-
tive power. Section 3 discusses the relevance
of the strong descriptive power of GIGs. We
discuss the structural description for the palin-
drome, copy and the multiple copies languages
{ww+|w ? ??}. Finally in section 4 we discuss
how this descriptive power can be used to en-
code HPSGs schemata.
2 Global Index Grammars
2.1 Linear Indexed Grammars
Indexed grammars, (IGs) (Aho, 1968), and
Linear Index Grammars, (LIGs;LILs) (Gazdar,
1988), have the capability to associate stacks of
indices with symbols in the grammar rules. IGs
are not semilinear. LIGs are Indexed Grammars
with an additional constraint in the form of the
productions: the stack of indices can be ?trans-
4For the notion of dependent paths see for instance
(Vijay-Shanker et al, 1987) or (Joshi, 2000).
mitted? only to one non-terminal. As a con-
sequence they are semilinear and belong to the
class of MCSGs. The class of LILs contains L4
but not L5 (see above).
A Linear Indexed Grammar is a 5-tuple
(V, T, I, P, S), where V is the set of variables,
T the set of terminals, I the set of indices, S
in V is the start symbol, and P is a finite set
of productions of the form, where A,B ? V ,
?, ? ? (V ? T )?, i ? I:
a. A[..] ? ? B[..] ? b. A[i..] ? ? B[..] ?
c. A[..] ? ?B[i..] ?
Example 1 L(Gwcw ) = {wcw |w ? {a, b}?},
Gww = ({S,R}, {a, b}, {i, j}, S, P ) and P is:
1.S[..] ? aS[i..] 2.S[..] ? bS[j..]
3.S[..] ? cR[..] 4.R[i..] ? R[..]a
5.R[j..] ? R[..]b 6. R[] ? ?
2.2 Global Indexed Grammars
GIGs use the stack of indices as a global con-
trol structure. This formalism provides a global
but restricted context that can be updated at
any local point in the derivation. GIGs are a
kind of regulated rewriting mechanisms (Dassow
and Pa?un, 1989) with global context and his-
tory of the derivation (or ordered derivation) as
the main characteristics of its regulating device.
The introduction of indices in the derivation is
restricted to rules that have terminals in the
right-hand side. An additional constraint that
is imposed on GIGs is strict leftmost derivation
whenever indices are introduced or removed by
the derivation.
Definition 1 A GIG is a 6-tuple G =
(N,T, I, S,#, P ) where N,T, I are finite pair-
wise disjoint sets and 1) N are non-terminals
2) T are terminals 3) I a set of stack indices 4)
S ? N is the start symbol 5) # is the start stack
symbol (not in I,N ,T ) and 6) P is a finite set of
productions, having the following form,5 where
5The notation in the rules makes explicit that oper-
ation on the stack is associated to the production and
neither to terminals nor to non-terminals. It also makes
explicit that the operations are associated to the com-
putation of a Dyck language (using such notation as
used in e.g. (Harrison, 1978)). In another notation: a.1
[y..]A ? [y..]?, a.2 [y..]A ? [y..]?, b. [..]A ? [x..]a ?
and c. [x..]A ? [..]?
x ? I, y ? {I ?#}, A ? N , ?, ? ? (N ?T )? and
a ? T .
a.i A ?? ? (epsilon)
a.ii A ?
[y]
? (epsilon with constraints)
b. A ?x a ? (push)
c. A ??x ? a ? (pop)
Note the difference between push (type b) and
pop rules (type c): push rules require the right-
hand side of the rule to contain a terminal in the
first position. Pop rules do not require a termi-
nal at all. That constraint on push rules is a
crucial property of GIGs. Derivations in a GIG
are similar to those in a CFG except that it is
possible to modify a string of indices. We de-
fine the derives relation ? on sentential forms,
which are strings in I?#(N ?T )? as follows. Let
? and ? be in (N ? T )?, ? be in I?, x in I, w be
in T ? and X i in (N ? T ).
1. If A ?? X1 ...Xn is a production of type (a.)
(i.e. ? = ? or ? = [x], x ? I) then:
i. ?#?A? ?? ?#?X1 ...Xn?
ii. x?#?A? ?? x?#?X1 ...Xn?
2. If A ?? aX1 ...Xn is a production of type
(b.) or push: ? = x, x ? I, then:
?#wA? ?? x?#waX1 ...Xn?
3. If A ?? X1 ...Xn is a production of type (c.)
or pop : ? = x?, x ? I, then:
x?#wA? ?? ?#wX1 ......Xn?
The reflexive and transitive closure of ? is
denoted, as usual by ??. We define the language
of a GIG, G, L(G) to be: {w|#S ?? #w and w
is in T ?}
The main difference between, IGs, LIGs and
GIGs, corresponds to the interpretation of the
derives relation relative to the behavior of the
stack of indices. In IGs the stacks of indices are
distributed over the non-terminals of the right-
hand side of the rule. In LIGs, indices are asso-
ciated with only one non-terminal at right-hand
side of the rule. This produces the effect that
there is only one stack affected at each deriva-
tion step, with the consequence of the semilin-
earity property of LILs. GIGs share this unique-
ness of the stack with LIGs: there is only one
stack to be considered. Unlike LIGs and IGs the
stack of indices is independent of non-terminals
in the GIG case. GIGs can have rules where the
right-hand side of the rule is composed only of
terminals and affect the stack of indices. Indeed
push rules (type b) are constrained to start the
right-hand side with a terminal as specified in
(6.b) in the GIG definition. The derives def-
inition requires a leftmost derivation for those
rules ( push and pop rules) that affect the stack
of indices. The constraint imposed on the push
productions can be seen as constraining the con-
text sensitive dependencies to the introduction
of lexical information. This constraint prevents
GIGs from being equivalent to a Turing Machine
as is shown in (Castan?o, 2003c).
2.2.1 Examples
The following example shows that GILs con-
tain a language not contained in LILs, nor in the
family of MCSLs. This language is relevant for
modeling coordination in NL.
Example 2 (Multiple Copies) .
L(Gwwn) = {ww+ | w ? {a, b}?}
Gwwn = ({S,R,A,B,C, L}, {a, b}, {i, j}, S,#, P )
and where P is: S ? AS | BS | C C ? RC | L

ji#abC ? ji#abRC ? i#abRBC ? #abRABC ?
#abABC ? i#abaBC ? ji#ababC ? ji#ababL ?
i#ababLb ? #ababab
The next example shows the MIX (or Bach)
language. (Gazdar, 1988) conjectured the MIX
language is not an IL. GILs are semilinear,
(Castan?o, 2003c) therefore ILs and GILs could
be incomparable under set inclusion.
Example 3 (MIX language) .L(Gmix ) =
{w|w ? {a, b, c}? and |a|w = |b|w = |c|w ? 1}
Gmix = ({S,D, F, L}, {a, b, c}, {i, j, k, l,m, n}, S,#, P )
where P is:
S ? FS | DS | LS | ? F ?

The following example shows that the family
of GILs contains languages which do not belong
to the MCSL family.
Example 4 (Multiple dependencies)
L(Ggdp) = { an(bncn)+ | n ? 1},
Ggdp = ({S,A,R,E,O,L}, {a, b, c}, {i}, S,#, P )

#aabbccER ? i#aabbccbR ? ii#aabbccbbL ?
ii#aabbccbbC ? i#aabbccbbcC ? #aabbccbbcc
2.3 GILs Recognition
The recognition algorithm for GILs we presented
in (Castan?o, 2003) is an extension of Earley?s al-
gorithm (cf. (Earley, 1970)) for CFLs. It has to
be modified to perform the computations of the
stack of indices in a GIG. In (Castan?o, 2003) a
graph-structured stack (Tomita, 1987) was used
to efficiently represent ambiguous index opera-
tions in a GIG stack. Earley items are modified
adding three parameters ?, c, o:
[?, c,o, A ? ? ?A?, i, j]
The first two represent a pointer to an active
node in the graph-structured stack ( ? ? I and
c ? n). The third parameter (o ? n) is used
to record the ordering of the rules affecting the
stack.
The O(n6 ) time-complexity of this algorithm
reported in (Castan?o, 2003) can be easily ver-
ified. The complete operation is typically the
costly one in an Earley type algorithm. It can
be verified that there are at most n6 instances of
the indices (c1 , c2 , o, i, k, j) involved in this oper-
ation. The counter parameters c1 and c2 , might
be state bound, even for grammars with ambigu-
ous indexing. In such cases the time complex-
ity would be determined by the CFG backbone
properties. The computation of the operations
on the graph-structured stack of indices are per-
formed at a constant time where the constant is
determined by the size of the index vocabulary.
O(n6 ) is the worst case; O(n3 ) holds for gram-
mars with state-bound indexing (which includes
unambiguous indexing)6; O(n2 ) holds for unam-
biguous context free back-bone grammars with
state-bound indexing and O(n) for bounded-
state7 context free back-bone grammars with
state-bound indexing.
3 GIGs and structural description
(Gazdar, 1988) introduces Linear Indexed
Grammars and discusses its applicability to Nat-
ural Language problems. This discussion is ad-
dressed not in terms of weak generative capac-
ity but in terms of strong-generative capacity.
Similar approaches are also presented in (Vijay-
Shanker et al, 1987) and (Joshi, 2000) (see
(Miller, 1999) concerning weak and strong gen-
erative capacity). In this section we review some
of the abstract configurations that are argued for
in (Gazdar, 1988).
3.1 The palindrome language
CFGs can recognize the language {wwR|w ?
??} but they cannot generate the structural de-
scription depicted in figure 1 (we follow Gazdar?s
notation: the leftmost element within the brack-
ets corresponds to the top of the stack):

Gazdar suggests that such configuration
would be necessary to represent Scandinavian

those grammars that produce for each string in the lan-
guage a unique indexing derivation.

state set is bounded by a constant.
unbounded dependencies.Such an structure can
be obtained using a GIG (and of course a LIG).
But the mirror image of that structure can-
not be generated by a GIG because it would
require to allow push productions with a non
terminal in the first position of the right-hand
side. However the English adjective construc-
tions that Gazdar argues that can motivate the
LIG derivation, can be obtained with the follow-
ing GIG productions as shown in figure 2.

Figure 2: A GIG structural description for the
language wwR
It should be noted that the operations on indices
follow the reverse order as in the LIG case. On
the other hand, it can be noticed also that the
introduction of indices is dependent on the pres-
ence of lexical information and its transmission
is not carried through a top-down spine, as in
the LIG or TAG cases. The arrows show the
leftmost derivation order that is required by the
operations on the stack.
3.2 The Copy Language
Gazdar presents two possible LIG structural de-
scriptions for the copy language. Similar struc-
tural descriptions can be obtained using GIGs.
However he argues that another tree structure
could be more appropriate for some Natural
Language phenomenon that might be modeled
with a copy language. Such structure cannot
be generated by a LIG, and can by an IG (see
(Castan?o, 2003b) for a complete discussion and
comparasion of GIG and LIG generated trees).
GIGs cannot produce this structural descrip-
tion, but they can generate the one presented in
figure 3, where the arrows depict the leftmost
derivation order. GIGs can also produce similar
structural descriptions for the language of mul-
tiple copies (the language {ww+| w ? ??} as
shown in figure 4, corresponding to the gram-
mar shown in example 2.

multiple copy language
4 GIGs and HPSGs
We showed in the last section how GIGs can
produce structural descriptions similar to those
of LIGs, and others which are beyond LIGs and
TAGs descriptive power. Those structural de-
scriptions corresponding to figure 1 were corre-
lated to the use of the SLASH feature in GPSGs
and HPSGs. In this section we will show how
the structural description power of GIGs, is not
only able to capture those phenomena but also
additional structural descriptions, compatible
with those generated by HPSGs. This follows
from the ability of GIGs to capture dependen-
cies through different paths in the derivation.
There has been some work compiling HPSGs
into TAGs (cf. (Kasper et al, 1995), (Becker
and Lopez, 2000)). One of the motivations
was the potential to improve the processing
efficiency of HPSG, performing HPSG deriva-
tions at compile time. Such compilation process
allowed to identify significant parts of HPSG
grammars that were mildly context-sensitive.
We will introduce informally some slight mod-
ifications to the operations on the stacks per-
formed by a GIG. We will allow the productions
of a GIG to be annotated with finite strings
in I ? I? instead of single symbols. This does
not change the power of the formalism. It is a
standard change in PDAs (cf. (Harrison, 1978))
to allow to push/pop several symbols from the
stack. Also the symbols will be interpreted rel-
ative to the elements in the top of the stack
(as a Dyck set). Therefore different derivations
might be produced using the same production
according to what are the topmost elements of
the stack. This is exemplified with the produc-
tions X ??nv x and X ?[n]v x, in particular in the
first three cases where different actions are taken
(the actions are explained in the parenthesis) :
nn?#wX? ??nv vn?#wx? (pop n and push v)
nv??#wX? ??nv ?#wx? (pop n and v?)
vn?#wX? ??nv vn?vn?#wx? (push n? and v)
n?#wX? ?
[n]v
vn?#wx? ( check and push)
We exemplify how GIGs can generate similar
structural descriptions as HPSGs do, in a very
oversimplified and abstract way. We will ignore
many details and try give an rough idea on how
the transmission of features can be carried out
from the lexical items by the GIG stack, obtain-
ing very similar structural descriptions.

and LIGs, suggests that LILs might be included
in GILs. We presented a succinct comparison
of the structural descriptions that can be gen-
erated both by LIGs and GIGs, we have shown
that GIGs generate structural descriptions for
the copy language which can not be generated
by LIGs. We showed also that this is the
case for other languages that can be generated
by both LIGs and GIGs. This corresponds
to the ability of GIGs to generate dependent
paths without copying the stack. We have
shown also that those non-local relationships
that are usually encoded in HPSGs as feature
transmission, can be encoded in GIGs using its
stack, exploiting the ability of Global stacks to
encode dependencies through dependent paths
and not only through a spine.

Abstract
In this paper we present the evaluation
of a set of string similarity metrics used
to resolve the mapping from strings to
concepts in the UMLS MetaThesaurus.
String similarity is conceived as a single
component in a full Reference Resolution
System that would resolve such a map-
ping. Given this qualification, we obtain
positive results achieving 73.6 F-measure
(76.1 precision and 71.4 recall) for the
task of assigning the correct UMLS con-
cept to a given string. Our results demon-
strate that adaptive string similarity meth-
ods based on Conditional Random Fields
outperform standard metrics in this do-
main.
1 Introduction
1.1 String Similarity and Reference Resolution
String similarity/matching algorithms are used as a
component in reference resolution algorithms. We
use reference resolution in a broad sense, which in-
cludes any of the following aspects:
a. Intra-document noun phrase reference resolu-
tion.
b. Cross-document or corpus reference resolution.
c. Resolution of entities found in a corpus with
databases, dictionaries or other external knowl-
edge sources. This is also called semantic inte-
gration, e.g., (Li et al, 2005), reference ground-
ing, e.g., (Kim and Park, 2004) or normaliza-
tion, e.g., (Pustejovsky et al, 2002; Morgan et
al., 2004).
The last two aspects of reference resolution are
particularly important for information extraction,
and the interaction of reference resolution with in-
formation extraction techniques (see for example
Bagga (1998)). The extraction of a particular set of
entities from a corpus requires reference resolution
for the set of entities extracted (e.g., the EDT task in
ACE1), and it is apparent that there is more variation
in the cross-document naming conventions than in a
single document.
The importance of edit distance algorithms has
already been noticed, (Mu?ller et al, 2002) and the
importance of string similarity techniques in the
biomedical domain has also been acknowledged,
e.g., (Yang et al, 2004).
String similarity/matching algorithms have also
been used extensively in related problems such as
Name databases and similar problems in structured
data, see (Li et al, 2005) and references mentioned
therein.
The problem of determining whether two similar
strings may denotate the same entity is particularly
challenging in the biomedical literature. It has al-
ready been noticed (Cohen et al, 2002) that there
is great variation in the naming conventions, and
noun phrase constructions in the literature. It has
also been noticed that bio-databases are hardly ever
updated with the names in the literature (Blaschke
1http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/
9
et al, 2003). A further complication is that the ac-
tual mentions found in text are more complex than
just names - including descriptors, in particular. Fi-
nally, ambiguity (where multiple entities have the
same name) is very pervasive in biomedicine.
In this paper we investigate the use of several
string similarity methods to group together string
mentions that might refer to the same entity or con-
cept. Specifically, we consider the sub-problem of
assigning an unseen mention to one of a set of exist-
ing unique entities or concepts, each with an associ-
ated set of known synonyms. As our aim here is fo-
cusing on improving string matching, we have pur-
posely factored out the problem of ambiguity (to the
extent possible) by using the UMLS MetaThesaurus
as our data source, which is largly free of strings that
refer to multiple entities. Thus, our work here can be
viewed an important piece in a larger normalization
or reference resolution system that resolves ambigu-
ity (which includes filtering out mentions that don?t
refer to any entity of interest).
The experiments reported on in this paper evalu-
ate a suite of robust string similarity techniques. Our
results demonstrate considerable improvement to be
gained by using adaptive string similarity metrics
based on Conditional Random Fields customized to
the domain at hand. The resulting best metric, we
term SoftTFIDF-CRF, achieves 73.6 F-measure on
the task of assigning a given string to the correct
concept. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate
a tradeoff between efficiency and recall based on  -
gram indexing.
2 Background
2.1 Entity Extraction and Reference
Resolution in the Biomedical Domain
Most of the work related to reference resolution in
this domain has been done in the following areas: a)
Intra-document Reference resolution, e.g (Castan?o
et al, 2002; Lin and Liang, 2004) b) Intra-document
Named entity recognition (e.g Biocreative Task 1A
(Blaschke et al, 2003), and others), also called clas-
sification of biological names (Torii et al, 2004) c)
Intra-document alias extraction d) cross-document
Acronym-expansion extraction, e.g., (Pustejovsky
et al, 2001). e) Protein names resolution against
database entries in SwissProt, protein name ground-
ing, in the context of a relation extraction task
(Kim and Park, 2004). One constraint in these ap-
proaches is that they use several patterns for the
string matching problem. The results of the protein
name grounding are 59% precision and 40% recall.
The Biocreative Task 1B task challenged systems
to ground entities found in article abstracts which
contain mentions of genes in Fly, Mouse and Yeast
databases. A central component in this task was re-
solving ambiguity as many gene names refer to mul-
tiple genes.
2.2 String Similarity and Ambiguity
In this subsection consider the string similarity is-
sues that are present in the biology domain in par-
ticular. The task we consider is to associate a string
with an existing entity, represented by a set of known
strings. Although the issue of ambiguity is present
in the examples we give, it cannot be resolved by
using string similarity methods alone, but instead by
methods that take into account the context in which
those strings occur.
The protein name p21 is ambiguous at least
between two entities, mentioned as p21-ras and
p21/Waf in the literature. A biologist can look at
a set of descriptions and decide whether the strings
are ambiguous or correspond to any of these two (or
any other entity).
The following is an example of such a mapping,
where R corresponds to p21-ras, W to p21(Waf) and
G to another entity (the gene). Also it can be noticed
that some of the mappings include subcases (e.g.,
R.1).2

Table 1: A possible mapping from strings to entities.

If we want to use an external knowlege source to
produce such a mapping, we can try to map it to con-
cepts in the UMLS Methatesaurus and entries in the
SwissProt database.
These two entities correspond to the concepts
C0029007 (p21-Ras) and C0288472 (p21-Waf) in
the UMLS Methathesaurus. There are 27 strings or
names in the UMLS that map to C0288472 (Table
2):
oncoprotein p21 CAP20
CDK2-associated protein 20 kDa MDA 6
Cdk2 inhibitor WAF1 CIP1
Cdk-interacting protein cdn1 protein
CDK-Interacting Protein 1 CDKN1A
CDKN1 protein Cip1 protein
Cip-1 protein mda-6 protein
Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A p21
p21 cell cycle regulator p21(cip1)
p21 cyclin kinase inhibitor p21(waf1-cip1)
Pic-1 protein (cyclin) p21-WAF1
senescent cell-derived inhibitor protein 1 protein p21
CDKN1A protein WAF1 protein
WAF-1 Protein
Table 2: UMLS strings corresponding to C0288472
There are 8 strings that map to concept C0029007
(Table 3).
Proto-Oncogene Protein p21(ras) p21(c-ras)
p21 RAS Family Protein p21 RAS Protein
Proto-Oncogene Protein ras c-ras Protein
ras Proto-Oncogene Product p21 p21(ras)
Table 3: UMLS strings corresponding to C0029007
It can be observed that there is only one exact
match: p21 in C0288472 and Table 1. It should
be noted that p21, is not present in the UMLS as a
possible string for C0029007. There are other close
matches like p21(Waf1/Cip1) (which seems very
frequent) and p21(waf1-cip1).
An expression like The inhibitor of cyclin-
dependent kinases WAF1 gene product p21 has
a high similarity with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase
Inhibitor 1 A and The cyclin-dependent kinase-I
p21(Waf-1) partially matches Cyclin-Dependent Ki-
nase
However there are other mappings which look
quite difficult unless some context is given to pro-
vide additional clues (e.g., v-p21).
The SwissProt entries CDN1A FELCA,
CDN1A HUMAN and CDN1A MOUSE are
related to p21(Waf). They have the following set of
common description names:
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, p21, CDK-
interacting protein 1.3
There is only one entry in SwissProt related to p21-
ras: Q9PSS8 PLAFE: with the description name
P21-ras protein and a related gene name: Ki-ras.
It should be noted that SwissProt classifies, as dif-
ferent entities, the proteins that refer to different or-
ganisms. The UMLS MetaThesaurus, on the other
hand, does not make this distinction. Neither is this
distinction always present in the literature.
3 Methods for Computing String
Similarity
A central component in the process of normaliza-
tion or reference resolution is computing string sim-
ilarity between two strings. Methods for measuring
string similarity can generally be broken down into
character-based and token-based approaches.
Character-based approaches typically consist of
the edit-distance metric and variants thereof. Edit
distance considers the number of edit operations (ad-
dition, substitution and deletion) required to trans-
form a string  into another string 
	 . The Leven-
stein distance assigns unit cost to all edit operations.
Other variations allow arbitrary costs or special costs
for starting and continuing a ?gap? (i.e., a long se-
quence of adds or deletes).
Token-based approaches include the Jaccard sim-
ilarity metric and the TF/IDF metric. The meth-
ods consider the (possibly weighted) overlap be-
tween the tokens of two strings. Hybrid token and
character-based are best represented by SoftTFIDF,
which includes not only exact token matches but
also close matches (using edit-distance, for exam-
ple). Another approach is to perform the Jaccard
similarity (or TF/IDF) between the  -grams of the
two strings instead of the tokens. See Cohen et
al. (2003) for a detailed overview and comparison
of some of these methods on different data sets.
3There are two more description names for the human and
mouse entries. The SwissProt database has also associated
Gene names to those entries which are related to some of the
possible names that we find in the literature. Those gene names
are: CDKN1A, CAP20, CDKN1, CIP1, MDA6, PIC1, SDI1,
WAF1, Cdkn1a, Cip1, Waf1. It can be seen that those names are
incorporated in the UMLS as protein names.
11
Recent work has also focused on automatic meth-
ods for adapting these string similarity measures
to specific data sets using machine learning. Such
approaches include using classifiers to weight var-
ious fields for matching database records (Cohen
and Richman, 2001). (Belenko and Mooney, 2003)
presents a generative, Hidden Markov Model for
string similarity.
4 An Adaptive String Similarity Model
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are a recent, in-
creasingly popular approach to sequence labeling
problems. Informally, a CRF bears resemblance to
a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in which, for each
input position in a sequence, there is an observed
variable and a corresponding hidden variable. Like
HMMs, CRFs are able to model (Markov) depen-
dencies between the hidden (predicted) variables.
However, because CRFs are conditional, discrimina-
tively trained models, they can incorporate arbitrary
overlapping (non-independent) features over the en-
tire input space ? just like a discriminative classi-
fier.
CRFs are log-linear models that compute the
probability of a state sequence,   
