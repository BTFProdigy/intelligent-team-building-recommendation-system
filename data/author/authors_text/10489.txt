Abstract 
Since its inception, the World Wide Web 
(WWW) has exponentially grown to shelter 
billions of monolingual and multilingual 
web pages that can be navigated through 
hyperlinks. Its structural properties provide 
useful information in presenting the socio-
linguistic properties of the web. In this 
study, about 26 million web pages under 
the South East Asian country code top-
level-domains (ccTLDs) are analyzed, sev-
eral language communities are identified, 
and the graph structure of these communi-
ties are analyzed. The distance between 
language communities are calculated by a 
distance metrics based on the number of 
outgoing links between web pages. Inter-
mediary languages are identified by graph 
analysis. By creating a language subgraph, 
the size and diameter of its strongly-
connected components are derived, as these 
values are useful parameters for language-
specific crawling. Performing a link struc-
ture analysis of the web pages can be a use-
ful tool for socio-linguistic and technical 
research purposes. 
1 Introduction 
The World Wide Web contains interlinked docu-
ments, called web pages, navigable by hyperlinks. 
Since its creation, it has grown to contain billions 
of web pages and several billion hyperlinks. These 
web pages are created by millions of people from 
all parts of the world. Each web page contains a 
large amount of information that can be shared and 
disseminated to people with Internet access. Au-
thors and creators of a web page come from differ-
ent backgrounds, different cultures, and different 
languages. Thus, a web page is a resource of multi-
lingual content, and a fertile source for socio-
linguistic analysis.  
1.1 Web Crawling 
While search-engines are important means of ac-
cessing the web for most users, automated systems 
of retrieving information from the web have been 
developed. These systems are called web crawlers, 
where a software agent is given a list of pages to 
visit. As the crawler visits these pages, it follows 
their outgoing links and adds these to the list of 
pages to visit. Each page is visited recursively ac-
cording to some sets of policies (e.g. the type of 
pages to retrieve, direction, the maximum depth 
from the URL (uniform resource locator), etc.). 
The result of this crawl is a vast amount of data, 
most of which may be irrelevant to certain indi-
viduals. Thus, a focused-crawling approach was 
implemented by some systems to limit the search 
to only a subset of the web. 
Focused crawlers rely on classifiers to work ef-
fectively. Language-specific crawlers, for example, 
need a very good language identification module 
that properly identifies the language of the web 
pages. General crawlers can be extended to include 
focused-crawling capabilities by incorporating the 
classifiers. Another important requirement to effi-
ciently crawl the desired domain is the list of initial 
web pages, called seed URLs. Each of these URLs 
will be enqueued into a list. The agent visits each 
URL in the list. Since the crawler recursively visits 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
49
the outgoing links of each URL, it is possible that 
the seed URL is an outgoing link of another seed 
URL, or an outgoing link of an outgoing link of 
another seed URL. Listing these URLs as seed 
URLs will just waste the crawler?s time in visiting 
them, when they have already been visited. If sev-
eral URLs can be reached from just one URL, the 
seed URL list size will decrease and the crawler 
will be more efficient. However, the maximum 
distance between these web pages must also be 
considered, since the crawler can have a policy to 
stop the crawling after reaching a certain depth.  
1.2 The Web as Graph 
A graph consists of a set of nodes, denoted by V 
and a set of edges, denoted by E. Each edge is a 
pair of nodes (u, v) representing a connection be-
tween u and v. A path between two nodes is a se-
quence of edges that is passed through from one 
node to reach the other node. 
In a directed graph, each edge is an ordered pair 
of nodes. A path from u to v does not imply a path 
from v to u. The distance between any two nodes is 
the number of edges in a shortest path connecting 
them. The diameter of the graph is the maximum 
distance between any two nodes. 
In an undirected graph, each edge is an unor-
dered pair of nodes. There is an edge between u 
and v if there is a link between u and v, regardless 
of which node is the source of the link. 
A strongly-connected component (SCC) of a di-
rected graph is a set of nodes such that for any pair 
of nodes u and v in the set, there is a path from u to 
v. The strongly-connected components of a graph 
consist of disjoint sets of nodes. A subgraph is a 
graph whose nodes and edges are subsets of an-
other graph. 
With the interlinked nature of the web, it can be 
represented as a graph, with the web pages as the 
nodes and the edges as the hyperlinks between the 
pages.  
1.3 Languages 
Languages are expressions of individuals and 
groups of individuals, essential to all form of 
communication. It is a fundamental medium of 
expressing one?s self whether in spoken or written 
form. Ehtnologue (2005) lists 6,912 known living 
languages in the world. Only a small portion of 
these languages can be found in the web today. 
A language community in the web is the group 
of web pages written in a language. Major lan-
guage communities discovered in each country 
indicates the dominant language of the country?s 
web space. How one language community is re-
lated to another language community can be shown 
by analyzing the hyperlinks between them. Thus, a 
language graph can be created with the language 
communities as nodes, and the links between the 
language communities as edges.  
2 Previous Studies 
One of the earliest web survey in Asia (Ciolek, 
1998) presented statistical data of the Asian web 
space by using the Altavista WWW search engine 
in gathering its data. In 2001, he wrote a paper pre-
senting the trends in the volume of hyperlinks con-
necting websites in 10 Eash Asian countries. 
Several studies have also been done regarding 
the representation of the web as a graph. Kumar et 
al. (2000) showed that a graph can be induced by 
the hyperlinks between pages. Measures on the 
connected component sizes and diameter were pre-
sented to show the high-level structure of the web. 
Broder et al (2000) did experiments on the web on 
a larger scale and showed the web?s macroscopic 
structure consisting of the SCC, IN, OUT, and 
TENDRILS. Balakrishnan and Deo (2006) ob-
served that the number of edges grow superlinearly 
with the number of nodes, showing the degree dis-
tributions and diameter. Petricek et al (2006) used 
web graph structural metrics to measure properties 
such as the distance between two random pages 
and interconnectedness of e-government websites. 
Bharat et al (2001) studied the macro-structure of 
the web, showing the linkage between web sites by 
creating the ?hostgraph?, with the nodes represent-
ing the hosts and the edges as the count of hyper-
links between pages on the corresponding hosts. 
Chakrabarti et al (1999) proposed a new ap-
proach to topic-specific web resource discovery by 
creating a focused crawler that selectively retrieves 
web pages relevant to a pre-defined set of topics. 
Stamatakis et al (2003) created CROSSMARC, a 
focused web crawler that collects domain-specific 
web pages. Deligenti et al (2000) presented a fo-
cused crawling algorithm that builds a model for 
the context within which relevant pages to a topic 
occur on the web. Pingali et al (2006) created an 
Indian search engine with a language identification 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
50
module that returns a language only if the number 
of words in a web page are above a given threshold 
value. The web pages were transliterated first into 
UTF-8 encoding. Tamura et al (2007) presented a 
simulation study of language specific crawling and 
proposed a method for selectively collecting web 
pages written in a specific language by doing a 
linguistic graph analysis of real web data, and then 
transforming them into variation of link selection 
strategies.  
Despite several studies on web graph and lan-
guage-specific crawling, no study has been done 
showing the ?language graph?. Herring et al 
(2007) showed a study on language networks of a 
selected web community, LiveJournal, but not on 
the web as a whole.  
3 Scope and Objectives of the Study 
This research was conducted on the 10 ccTLDs of 
the South East Asian countries. This paper, how-
ever, will only show the results for the Indonesian 
domain (.id). 
This research aims to show the socio-linguistic 
properties of the language communities in each 
country at the macroscopic level. The web page 
distribution for each language community in a 
given ccTLD and its most frequently linked to lan-
guages are shown. The distance is also computed 
and the language graph is illustrated. 
This research also aims to show the graph prop-
erties of some Filipino language communities and 
its implication for crawling. Graph properties like 
the SCC size and the diameter will be presented to 
show these characteristics in a subset of the web. 
Finally, this research demonstrates the useful-
ness of graph analysis approaches.  
4 Methodology 
This study was conducted by performing a series 
of steps from the collection of data to the presenta-
tion of the results through images.  
4.1 UbiCrawler 
UbiCrawler (Boldi et al, 2004) was used to 
download the web pages under the Asian ccTLDs. 
These pages were downloaded primarily for the 
purpose of assessing the usage level of each 
language in cyberspace, one of the objectives of 
the Language Observatory Project (LOP) 1 . The 
crawl was started on July 5, 2006, running for 14 
days. 107,168,733 web pages were collected from 
43 ccTLDs in Asia. Each page contains several 
information such as the character set and outgoing 
links. For this study, the URL of a web page and 
the URL of its outgoing links were used. Although 
there are many web pages of Asia that can be 
found in generic domains, they were not included 
in this survey to limit the volume of the crawl data.  
4.2 Language Identification 
A language identification module (LIM) developed 
for LOP based on the n-gram method (Suzuki et al, 
2002) was used to identify on what language a 
page is written in. This method first creates byte 
sequences for each training text of a language. It 
then checks the byte sequences of the web pages 
that match the byte sequences of the training texts. 
The language having the highest matching rate is 
considered as the language of the web page. The 
language identification module used the parallel 
corpus of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR), translated into several languages. 
After crawling, LIM was executed to identify the 
languages of each downloaded web page. The 
identification result was stored in a LIM result file 
that contains the URL, the language, and matching 
rate, among others. In this study, the issues 
regarding the accuracy of LIM will not be 
discussed.  
4.3 Web Page Analysis 
For this study, the web pages of the 10 South East 
Asian ccTLDs were selected for analysis. There 
were 26,196,823 web pages downloaded under 
these ccTLDs. The web pages for each country 
were grouped by languages. The list of languages 
was narrowed down to 20 based on the number of 
pages, arranged from highest to lowest. 
The link structure can be analyzed by traversing 
the outgoing links of each web page. For each web 
page, its outgoing links are retrieved. For each out-
going link, the LIM result file is checked for its 
language. The number of outgoing links in each 
language is counted. If the URL of the outgoing 
link is not on the file, it wasn?t downloaded. There-
fore, the language of the ougoing link is unidenti-
fied. This is usually the case of outgoing links un-

der the generic TLDs (e.g., .com, .org, .gov, etc.) 
and non-Asian ccTLDs.  
4.4 Language Graph 
There is a link between two languages if there is at 
least one outgoing link from a web page in one 
language to the other language. The language 
graph is created through contraction procedure, 
where all edges linking the same language page are 
contracted.  
4.5 Language Adjacency Matrix 
Based on the number of web pages in a language 
and the number of outgoing links from one lan-
guage to another, the language adjacency table N 
for each country is created. The row and column 
headers are the same ? the top 20 languages based 
on the number of web pages. The value Nij is the 
number of outgoing links from language i to lan-
guage j. 
The language adjacency matrix P contains the 
ratio of the number of outgoing links and the total 
number of outgoing links as can be found in the 
language adjacency table. Each cell value, Pij is the 
probability that a web page in a language i has an 
outgoing link to language j. 
?=
k
ikijij NNP /  
A link from language i to language j is not nec-
essarily accompanied by a link from language j to i. 
Even if there is a link, the number of outgoing 
links is not equal. To show the relationship be-
tween two languages based on the link structure, 
the language distance is computed.  
4.6 Distance between Languages 
The distance between two languages measures 
their level of connectedness. It is the relationship 
between the number of outgoing links from lan-
guage i to language j and vice versa. The distance 
is computed as the ratio of the number of outgoing 
links between two languages and the total number 
of outgoing links of the two languages. 
The distance between language i and language j, 
Dij is, ( ) ?? ?+= ijij R1/D  where Rij is the lan-
guage link ratio is defined as,  
( ) ?
?
??
?
? ++= ??
k
jkik
k
jiijij NNNNR /   for (i ? j) 
1=ijR     for (i = j) 
where ? is an adjusting parameter introduced to 
avoid division-by-zero, which may happen when 
Rij=0, i.e. no links between two languages. We set 
?=0.0001. Thus, the maximum distance between 
languages becomes 99. ? is another adjusting pa-
rameter to make Dij as a distance metrics, and we 
set ?=1. Assumption behind this definition is based 
on commonly-observed rules in our world. It is 
widely observed that interaction between two ob-
jects is proportional to the inverse square of dis-
tance between two objects. The number of web 
links between two language communities is con-
sidered as a kind of interaction. Languages with no 
links between them have a distance of 99, and the 
distance of a language to itself is 0. 
Based on this distance metrics, the macroscopic 
language graph is created. A distance limit of 15 is 
used to clearly show which languages are closely-
related by their link structure.  
4.7 Intermediary Languages 
Considering the direction of the outgoing links, the 
possibility that language i will link to language j 
may be lesser than the possibility that language i 
will link to language j by passing through an in-
termediary language k, such that PikPkj > Pij. The 
intermediary language is identified, as this would 
mean that there are better ways to reach another 
language from one language.  
4.8 Graph Analysis using JGraphT 
JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides 
graph objects and algorithms. The library provides 
classes that calculates and returns the strongly-
connected components subgraphs. To compute the 
distance between nodes, several graph searching 
algorithms are available, one of which is the Dijik-
stra algorithm that computes for the shortest path. 
A utility to export the graph into a format readable 
by most graph visualization tools is also available. 
A graph file, written in the DOT language (a plain 
text graph description language) was created, con-
taining the nodes and edges of language pages. 
From this, the strongly-connected components and 
its properties (i.e. size, diameter) were determined.  
4.9 GraphVis: Visualization Tool 
GraphViz is open-source graph visualization 
software that takes descriptions of graphs in a 
simple text language and makes diagrams in 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
52
several formats, including images. The neato 
layout, which makes ?spring model? layouts, was 
used to visualize the distance between languages. 
However, the calculated distance cannot be drawn 
exactly, and this visualization is only two-
dimensional. So, the images are distorted and do 
not illustrate the exact distance, only an 
approximation.  
5 Results 
This section shows some results on the Indonesian 
domain.  
5.1 Link Structure 
Indonesia is a country with one of the biggest lan-
guage diversity in the world. According to Eth-
nologue2, 742 languages are spoken in the country. 
But, the LIM results show that only five of these 
languages are listed in the top 10 languages in the 
country, i.e., Javanese, Indonesian, Malay, Sun-
danese, and Madurese.

5.3 Graph Properties 
This section discusses the size distribution of the 
SCCs and the diameter of the Filipino language 
community in Indonesia. 
 
SCC size 
The SCCs of a graph are those sets of nodes such 
that for every node, there is a path to all the other 
nodes. The size of each SCC refers to the number 
of nodes it contains. Distribution of the sizes of 
SCCs gives a good understanding of the graph 
structure of the web, and has important implica-
tions for crawling. If most components have large 
sizes, only a few nodes are needed as seed URLs (a 
list of starting pages for a crawler) to be able to 
reach all the other nodes. If all nodes are members 
of a single SCC, one URL is enough to crawl all 
pages.

calculated and plotted in the chart. Their corre-
sponding SCC graph is also shown. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Diameter distribution of the Filipino 
language community in Indonesia 
 
For the Filipino language subgraph of Indonesia, 
the component with the largest node size also has 
the largest diameter. However, the largest diameter 
size is only 3, which is a very small number. Most 
of the components have a diameter of 4.  
6 Implications 
For the Filipino language community, many SCCs 
can be found in the Philippines, since Filipino is 
one of its national languages. However, for some 
countries, there are not many SCCs. For example, 
Indonesia only has 18 SCCs, half of which consist 
only of one node. However, the largest component 
size is 45, and there are 4 more large components. 
By picking out just one node from each SCC with 
a large size and using it as a seed URL, many web 
pages can already be downloaded. Add to it the 
depth parameter of 3, which is the largest diameter, 
these web pages can be downloaded within a short 
period of time. 
The choice of seed URL and the crawly depth 
are useful parameters for crawling. The analysis is 
done for each language community to get these 
parameters for language-specific crawling pur-
poses. These parameters are different for each lan-
guage community. This paper shows only shows 
the case of the Filipino language community of 
Indonesia as a sample illustration of the diameter 
metric.  
7 Conclusion 
The vastness and multilingual content of the web 
makes it a rich source of culturally-diversified in-
formation. Since web pages are connected by hy-
perlinks, information can be readily accesses by 
jumping from one page to another via the hyper-
links. 
For each country domain, the web pages written 
in the same language form a language community. 
The link structure between language communities 
shows how connected a language community is 
with another language community. It can be as-
sumed that the close links between two language 
communities on the web imply the existence of 
multilingual speakers of the two languages. Oth-
erwise linked pages will not be visited. In this con-
text, the language graph analysis demonstrated in 
this study gives an effective tool to understand the 
linguistic scenes of the country. If the same analy-
sis is performed for the secondary level domain 
data, further insight into the socio-linguistic status 
of each language can be drawn. Secondary domain 
corresponds to different social area of language 
activities, such as ?ac? or ?edu? for academic and 
education arena, ?go? or ?gov? for government or 
public arena, and ?co? or ?com? for commercial 
business and occupational arena. Although this 
study does not extend its scope to the secondary 
level domain analysis, the effectiveness of the ap-
proach was demonstrated. 
Another implication drawn from this study is 
that the language graph analysis can identify in-
termediary languages in the multilingual communi-
ties. In the real world, some languages are acting 
as a medium of communications among the differ-
ent language speakers. In most cases, such lingua 
franca are international languages such as English, 
French, Arabic, etc. But it?s difficult to identify 
which language is acting as such in detail. But on 
the web link structure among languages, the lan-
guage graph can give us a clue to identify this. As 
shown in this paper, there are a number of lan-
guages acting as intermediary between two lan-
guages having only a few hyperlinks between them. 
Although the result of this category is doubtful 
because of misidentification of language, some 
cases show the expected result. 
The second objective of the study is to give a 
microscopic level structure of the web communi-
ties for much more practical and technical reasons, 
such as how to design more effective crawling 
strategy, and how to prepare starting URLs with 
minimal efforts. The key issue in this context is to 
reveal the connectedness of the web. To show the 
connectedness of language communities, several

graph theory metrics, the size and numbers of 
strongly-connected components and the diameters 
are calculated and visual presentations of language 
communities are also given. This information can 
aid in defining parameters used for crawling, par-
ticularly language-specific crawling. 
As a summary, the link structure analysis of lan-
guage graphs can be a useful tool for various spec-
trums of socio-linguistic and technical research 
purposes.  
8 Limitations and Future Work  
The results of this research are highly dependent 
on the language identification module (LIM). With 
a more improved LIM, more accurate results can 
be presented. Currently, there is an ongoing ex-
periment that uses a new LIM. 
This analysis will also be done to the secondary-
level-domains to show the language distribution 
for different social areas. 
Future work also includes the creation of a lan-
guage-specific crawler that will incorporate the 
results derived from the analysis of the SCC size 
and diameter of the language subgraphs.

Abstract 
Myanmar script uses no space between 
words and syllable segmentation represents 
a significant process in many NLP tasks 
such as word segmentation, sorting, line 
breaking and so on. In this study, a rule-
based approach of syllable segmentation 
algorithm for Myanmar text is proposed. 
Segmentation rules were created based on 
the syllable structure of Myanmar script 
and a syllable segmentation algorithm was 
designed based on the created rules. A 
segmentation program was developed to 
evaluate the algorithm. A training corpus 
containing 32,283 Myanmar syllables was 
tested in the program and the experimental 
results show an accuracy rate of 99.96% 
for segmentation. 
1 Introduction 
Myanmar language, also known as Burmese, is the 
official language of the Union of Myanmar. It is 
spoken by 32 million as a first language, and as a 
second language by ethnic minorities in Myanmar 
(Ethnologue, 2005). Burmese is a member of the 
Tibeto-Burman languages, which is a subfamily of 
the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. Burmese is a 
tonal and analytic language using the Burmese 
script. This is a phonologically based script, 
adapted from Mon, and ultimately based on an In-
dian (Brahmi) prototype (Daniels and Bright, 
1996). Burmese characters are rounded in shape 
and the script is written from left to right. No space 
is used between words but spaces are usually used 
to separate phrases. 
The Myanmar language still remains as one of 
the less privileged Asian languages in cyberspace. 
Many people have put considerable effort into the 
computerization of the Myanmar script. However, 
Myanmar still lacks support on computers and not 
many NLP tools and applications are available for 
this language. A standard encoding is needed for 
the language processing of Myanmar script; how-
ever, there is not yet any official national standard 
encoding for Myanmar script. 
This study focuses on the syllable segmentation 
of Myanmar text based on the UTN11-21 encoding 
model for Myanmar script. Myanmar script has 
been granted space in Unicode (U+1000-U+109F) 
since version 3.0. In Unicode version 4.0, the Uni-
code consortium defined standards for encoding 
Myanmar script and canonical order. The current 
version of Unicode is 5.0. However, there are only 
a few Unicode-compliant Myanmar fonts that fully 
follow the Unicode encoding standard. Local font 
developers and implementers have produced fonts 
that follow only part of the Unicode standards and 
many of these partially-compliant fonts are widely 
used in cyberspace. In 2006, Myanmar proposed 
additional characters2 to be added to the Unicode 
version 5.0. The proposed characters for the Bur-
mese script are as follows: 
? 102B MYANMAR VOWEL SIGN TALL 
AA 
? 1039 MYANMAR SIGN VIRAMA             
[Glyph change and note change]

The Unicode technical committee has accepted 
these proposed characters for inclusion in future 
versions of the Unicode standard.3 If the proposal 
is adopted, this will become the standard encoding 
for Myanmar script. Therefore, this paper employs 
the proposed encoding model for the syllable seg-
mentation of Myanmar text. 
2 Related Work 
The lack of official standard encoding hinders lo-
calization of Myanmar language and no previous 
work on the syllable segmentation of Myanmar 
script was found. Although character codes for 
Myanmar languages have been allocated in 
UCS/Unicode (U+1000?U+109F), lack of imple-
mentation makes them unavailable to local end 
users (Ko Ko and Mikami, 2005). We can learn, 
however, from related works done for other lan-
guages which have similarities to Myanmar. Many 
attempts have been made in Thai language proc-
essing for syllable and word segmentation. 
Poowarawan (1986) proposed a dictionary-based 
approach to Thai syllable separation. Thai syllable 
segmentation was considered as the first step to-
wards word segmentation and many of word seg-
mentation ambiguities were resolved at the level of 
syllable segmentation (Aroonmanakun, 2002). 
Thai syllable segmentation can be viewed as the 
problem of inserting spaces between pairs of char-
acters in the text and the character-level ambiguity 
of word segmentation can be reduced by extracting 
syllables whose structures are more well-defined 
(Sornil and Chaiwanarom, 2004). Most approaches 
                                                 
3 http://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html 
to Thai word segmentation use a dictionary as their 
basis. However, the segmentation accuracy de-
pends on the quality of the dictionary used for 
analysis and unknown words can reduce the per-
formance. Theeramunkong and Usanavasin (2001) 
proposed a non dictionary-based approach to Thai 
word segmentation. A method based on decision 
tree models was proposed and their approach 
claimed to outperform some well-known diction-
ary-dependent techniques of word segmentation 
such as the maximum and the longest matching 
methods. 
3 Myanmar Alphabets 
In order to clarify the syllable structure, characters 
of the Myanmar script are classified into twelve 
categories. Each category is given a name and the 
glyphs and Unicode code points of characters be-
longing to each category are shown in Table 1.  
The Myanmar script consists of a total of 75 char-
acters. There are 34 consonant letters in Conso-
nants group, four medials in the Medials group and 
eight vowels in the Dependent Vowels group. 
Myanmar Sign Virama is used for stacking conso-
nant letters and it does not have a glyph, while 
Myanmar Sign Asat is used in devowelising proc-
ess (e.g. ???). There are three dependent various 
signs in Group F. The Group I consists of three 
independent vowels (?, ?, ?) and three inde-
pendent various signs (?, ?, ?). The characters 
in Group I can act as stand-alone syllables. Group 
E consists of four independent vowels (?, ?, ?, 
?) and Myanmar Symbol Aforementioned (?). 
Each of the independent vowels in group E has its 
own syllable but they can also combine with other 
signs to form a syllable (e.g. ??% ?). Myanmar 
Symbol Aforementioned in Group E can never 
stand alone and it is always written as ???? as a 
short form of ??????????. Myanmar Letter Great 
Sa is always preceded by a consonant and is never 
written alone (e.g. ????). There are ten Myanmar 
digits in the Digits group. The group P consists of 
two Myanmar punctuation marks. Myanmar script 
uses white space between phrases, which is taken 
into account in this study. Non-Myanmar charac-
ters are not included in this study.

Table 1. Classification of Myanmar Script 
 
4 Syllable Structure 
A Myanmar syllable consists of one initial 
consonant, zero or more medials, zero or more 
vowels and optional dependent various signs. 
Independent vowels, independent various signs and 
digits can act as stand-alone syllables. According 
to the Unicode standard, vowels are stored after the 
consonant. Therefore, Myanmar vowel sign E 
(U+1031) is stored after the consonant although it 
is placed before the consonant in rendering (e.g. 
??). Medials may appear at most three times in a 
syllable (e.g. ??i?). Vowels may appear twice in a 
syllable (e.g. ???). In a syllable, a second 
consonant may come together with an Asat for 
devowelising (e.g. ???). Each of the independent 
vowels in group E has its own syllable but they can 
also combine with other signs (consonants, 
dependent vowels, dependent various signs) to 
form a syllable (e.g. ??j?k, ??% ?, ??, ?l?????). The 
syllable structure of Myanmar script can be written 
in BNF (Backus-Naur Form) as follows: 
Syllable ::= C{M}{V}{F} | C{M}V+A | 
C{M}{V}CA[F] | E[CA][F] | I | D 
 
 
Figure 1. FSA for Syllable Structure 
 
A finite state machine or finite state automaton 
(FSA) can be employed to demonstrate the syllable 
structure of Myanmar script. A finite state machine 
is a model of behavior composed of a finite num-
ber of states, transitions between those states, and 
actions. The starting state is shown by a bold circle 
and double circles indicate final or accepting 
states. The above figure shows a finite state 
automaton that can realize a Myanmar syllable. 
Examples of Myanmar syllables and their equiva-
lent Unicode code points are shown in Table 2.

5 Syllable Segmentation Rules 
Typically, a syllable boundary can be determined 
by comparing pairs of characters to find whether a 
break is possible or not between them. However, in 
some cases it is not sufficient to determine a sylla-
ble boundary by just comparing two characters. 
The following sections explain these cases and 
give examples.  
5.1 Devowelising 
In one syllable, a consonant may appear twice but 
the second consonant is used for the devowelising 
process in conjunction with an Asat (U+103A 
MYANMAR SIGN ASAT). Therefore the charac-
ter after the second consonant should be further 
checked for an Asat. If the character after the sec-
ond consonant is an Asat, there should be no sylla-
ble break before the second consonant. 
 
        No break  
     
??? ? ?  ?  (elephant) 
C  C A 
  
   No break 
5.2 Syllable Chaining 
Subjoined characters are shown by using an invisi-
ble Virama sign (U+1039 MYANMAR SIGN VI-
RAMA) to indicate that the following character is 
subjoined and should take a subjoined form. In this 
case, if the character after the second consonant is 
an invisible Virama sign, there should be no sylla-
ble break before the second and third consonant. 
Although there are two syllables in a subjoined 
form, it is not possible to separate them in written 
form and they are therefore treated as one syllable. 
 
        No break 
 
??? ? ? ? ? ? ? (novel) 
  C C S  C  V 
 
No break 
 
54
5.3 Kinzi 
Kinzi is a special form of devowelised Nga 
(U+1004 MYANMAR LETTER NGA) with the 
following letter underneath, i.e., subjoined. In this 
case, if the character after the second consonant is 
an Asat and the next character after Asat is an in-
visible Virama sign (U+1039 MYANMAR SIGN 
VIRAMA) then there should be no syllable break 
before the second and third consonant. Kinzi also 
consists of two syllables but it is treated as one 
syllable in written form. 
 
 No break 
 
????? ?  ? ?  ?  ? - ? ? (blessing) 
  C C A S  C - C V 
 
No break 
5.4 Loan Words 
Usage of loan words can be found in Myanmar 
text. Although loan words do not follow the 
Myanmar syllable structure, their usage is common 
and the segmentation rules for these words are 
considered in this study. 
 
  No break 
 
???????????       ? ? ? ? ? - ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  (Mars) 
                   C V F C A - C M V V C  A 
  
 No break 
5.5 Great Sa 
There should be no syllable break before great Sa 
(U+103F MYANMAR LETTER GREAT SA) as 
great Sa acts like a stacked ??  and devowelises the 
preceding consonant.  
 
   No break 
 
???? ? -  ? ?  ? (human) 
  C - C V G 
 
           No break 
5.6 Contractions 
There are usages of double-acting consonants in 
Myanmar text. The double-acting consonant acts 
as both the final consonant of one syllable and the 
initial consonant of the following syllable. There 
are two syllables in a contracted form but they can-
not be segmented in written form and there should 
be no syllable break between them. 
 
   No break 
 
???????? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (man) 
  C  V  V   C A M V F 
 
No break 
6 Implementation 
Syllable segmentation rules are presented in the 
form of letter sequence tables (Tables 4-6). The 
tables were created by comparing each pair of 
character categories. However, it is not sufficient 
to determine all syllable breaks by comparing only 
two characters. In some cases, a maximum of four 
consecutive characters need to be considered to 
determine a possible syllable boundary. Two addi-
tional letter sequence tables were created for this 
purpose (Tables 5 and 6).  
Table 4 defines the break status for each pair of 
two consecutive characters. Table 5 and 6 define 
the break status for each pair of three and four con-
secutive characters, respectively. The symbol U in 
the Table 4 and 5 stands for undefined cases. Cases 
undefined in Table 4 are defined in the Table 5, 
and those undefined in Table 5 are then defined in 
Table 6. 
The syllable segmentation program obtains the 
break status for each pair of characters by compar-
ing the input character sequence with the letter se-
quence tables. The syllable break status and defini-
tions are shown in Table 3. The break status -1 in-
dicates a breach of canonical spelling order and a 
question mark is appended after the ambiguous 
character pair. The status 0 means there should be 
no syllable break after the first character. For break 
cases, a syllable breaking symbol (i.e. B in the 
flowchart) is inserted at each syllable boundary of 
the input string. The syllable segmentation process 
is shown in the flowchart in Figure 2.

7 Method and Results 
A syllable segmentation program was developed to 
evaluate the algorithm and segmentation rules.  
The program accepts the Myanmar text string and 
shows the output string in a segmented form. The 
program converts the input text string into equiva-
lent sequence of category form (e.g. CMCACV for 
??????) and compares the converted character se-
quence with the letter sequence tables to determine 
syllable boundaries. A syllable segmented Myan-
mar text string is shown as the output of the pro-
gram. The symbol "|" is used to represent the syl-
lable breaking point. In order to evaluate the accu-
racy of the algorithm, a training corpus was devel-
oped by extracting 11,732 headwords from Myan-
mar Orthography (Myanmar Language Commis-
sion, 2003). The corpus contains a total of 32,238 
Myanmar syllables. These syllables were tested in 
the program and the segmented results were manu-
ally checked. The results showed 12 errors of in-
correctly segmented syllables, thus achieving accu-
racy of 99.96% for segmentation. The few errors 
occur with the Myanmar Letter Great Sa ??? and 
the Independent Vowel ???. The errors can be fixed 
by updating the segmentation rules of these two 
characters in letter sequence tables. Some exam-
ples of input text strings and their segmented re-
sults are shown in Table 7.  
8 Conclusion 
Syllables are building blocks of words and syllable 
segmentation is essential for the language process-
ing of Myanmar script. In this study, a rule-based 
approach of syllable segmentation algorithm for 
Myanmar script is presented. The segmentation 
rules were created based on the characteristics of 
Myanmar syllable structure. A segmentation pro-
gram was developed to evaluate the algorithm. A 
test corpus containing 32,238 Myanmar syllables 
was tested in the program and 99.96% accuracy 
was achieved. From this study, we can conclude 
that syllable segmentation of Myanmar text can be 
implemented by a rule-based approach. While 
characters of non-Myanmar script are not consid-
ered in this study, the segmentation rules can be 
further extended to cover these characters. A com-
plete syllable segmentation algorithm for Myanmar 
script can be further implemented by applying this 
algorithm.

Abstract 
Terminology development in education, 
science and technology is a key to formu-
lating a knowledge society. The authors 
are developing a multilingual engineering 
terminology dictionary consisting of more 
than ten thousand engineering terms each 
for ten Asian languages and English. The 
dictionary is primarily designed to support 
foreign students who are studying engi-
neering subjects at Japanese higher educa-
tional institutions in the Japanese language. 
Analysis of the lexical terms could provide 
useful knowledge for language resource 
creators. There are two adoption ap-
proaches, ?phonetic adoption? (translitera-
tion of borrowed terms) and ?semantic 
adoption? (where the meaning is expressed 
using native words). The proportion of the 
two options found in the terminology set of 
each country (or language) shows a sub-
stantial difference and seems to reflecti 
language policies of the country and the in-
fluence of foreign languages on the host 
language. This paper presents preliminary 
results of our investigation on this question 
based on a comparative study of three lan-
guages: Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai.  
 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Terminology in Development Context 
For developing countries there is a strong necessity 
to establish an appropriate set of terminology to 
enable local people to learn science and technology 
in an efficient manner throughout their educational 
programs using their mother tongues as the instruc-
tional medium. Instruction in the mother tongue is 
beneficial for students to acquire a basic concept in 
a subject (UNESCO, 2003).  
International communities are fully aware of this 
necessity. The World Summit on the Information 
Society (WSIS) addressed this issue, saying that 
terminology development in education, science and 
culture is a key to developing knowledge societies. 
1.2 Two Approaches to Adopting Terms 
Unlike the situation with basic vocabulary, scien-
tific or technical terms are usually not ?home-
grown?, but are often imported from the outside 
world. And when a scientific or technical term is 
imported from one language (the source language) 
to another language (the host language), typically 
two approaches are found. 
The first approach is to simply borrow a word 
by creating a phonetically equivalent word in the 
host language. For example, the equivalent of the 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, 2008
25
English word "science" in Malay is "sains", pro-
nounced as /sains/, and "computer" in Japanese is 
written as "??????" in the Japanese kata-
kana1 syllabary and is pronounced /konpju:ta/ . We 
call this phonetic adoption in this paper. It is quite 
similar to transliteration, but not exactly the same 
due to the difference in phonetic structure between 
the source and host languages. 
The second approach is to create a new word by 
combining a semantically relevant word-root or 
word in the host language. For example, "science" 
in Thai is "???????????", pronounced /w?tthayas?:t/. 
This word is derived from the word "vidya" 
(knowledge) in Sanskrit, a source from which the 
Thai language has imported many words through-
out its history. "Science" in Japanese is "??", 
pronounced /kagaku/. This word was coined more 
than one hundred years ago as a combination of 
two Chinese characters, "?" and "?", meaning "a 
section, or a branch of something" and "learning",  
respectively. As shown in these two cases, it often 
happens that classical languages like Sanskrit or 
Chinese, rather than the host language itself, pro-
vide root-words in this creation process just as 
Latin and Greek roots are used in scientific and 
technical terms in English. We call this approach 
semantic adoption in this paper. 
1.3 Pros and Cons of the Two Approaches 
When we look back on the historical evolution of 
scientific terms dating from ancient civilization to 
modern times, both types of adoption are found. 
Both approaches to adoption have advantages and 
disadvantages in terms of ease of creation and ease 
of understanding, as well as other issues. The pros 
and cons of semantic adoption, summarized in Ta-
ble 1, are in principle the opposites of those of 
phonetic adoption.  
But the choice of adoption approach is not so 
simple. The phonetic adoption option is easy to 
implement, but would have the danger of disturb-
ing language purity, which also has a high priority 
in many nations. When the semantic adoption op-
tion is chosen, language purity is maintained but 
the adoption cost is high and it takes time to pre-
                                                 
1 In Japanese, four scripts are used to write Japanese, e.g. 
kanji (i.e., Chinese characters), hiragana, katakana and 
the Latin alphabet. Katakana script is conventionally 
used to represent foreign phonetically translated words. 
pare a meaningful number of vocabulary items and 
to train teachers in their use.

Approaches to Term Adoption

language

to guess what it  
means, or at least to  
what it relates 
(1) not easy to find  
connectivity to the  
original word 
(2) not easy to create
1.4 Third Approach: Use of foreign language 
In addition to this dilemma, a completely different 
approach can be taken when the necessity is very 
urgent. This is to design and to implement the 
whole educational program by means of an estab-
lished foreign language. We call this approach the 
source language approach. In the real world to-
day, this third approach is widely adopted in many 
developing countries, to various extents. The 
choice of foreign language depends on subject do-
mains and the economic and political condition of 
the country as well as on historical ties.  
1.5 Objectives of the study 
In summary, there are three basic options. How-
ever, little research has been carried out on how a 
language community can effectively formulate 
terminology focused on Asian languages. ?Guide-
lines for Terminology Policy? (Infoterm 2005) 
talks about various issues relating to this subject, 
but no mention is found relating to the question of 
adoption strategy. The authors believe that an 
analysis of the existing terminology can provide 
practical and applicable lessons to terminology 
development practitioners and policy makers. This 
paper presents preliminary results of our investiga-
tion on this question, based on a comparative study 
of three countries: Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai.  
2 Dictionary

multilingual engineering dictionary based on Babel

To this primary source, we added some terms in 
mathematics and physics and made a multilingual 
database such as that shown in Table 3 by adding

adoptions into 8 languages: Vietnamese, Chinese, 
Korean, Filipino, Malay, Sinhalese, Myanmar and 
Mongolian. The data are coded in Unicode. At pre-
sent Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean and Sinhalese 
language have been translated and other languages 
will be finished soon. The dictionary will be made 
in April, 2008. For this paper, we have selected 
three languages for analysis ? Vietnamese, Thai 
and Japanese ? because these languages have rela-
tively rich vocabularies. 
3 Comparison of Adoption Approaches  
The approach to terminology adoption is examined 
in this section from various angles. 
3.1 Comparison by Country 
In order to investigate the portfolio of two adoption 
approaches, we surveyed the entire lexicon for all 
mechanical engineering subjects. In addition, we 
took a random sampling in our dictionary and 
chose approximately 25 words from two major 
subject fields: architecture and computer science. 
The portfolios of three languages are shown in Ta-
ble 4. Compounds such as hybrids of native and 
loaned word-components were separated from se-
mantic adoption.

Table 4 shows that the Japanese language has 
the highest percentage of phonetically translated 
words from English. Vietnamese has the lowest 
percentage of phonetic adopted words from Eng-
lish, but includes terms from French in mechanical 
engineering plus a few from Russian. Thai shows a 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, 2008
27
roughly similar balance between semantic adoption 
and English-origin terms in all three domains.  
The high number of Thai and Vietnamese origin 
words in computer science is rather remarkable, as 
it indicates a consistent effort to adapt the Thai 
language to every emerging technology. Note that 
over half of the computer science terms for Japa-
nese are of English origin. Vietnamese draws on 
different languages to varying degrees; it is notable 
that the languages of origin vary by subject field.  
3.2 Comparison by Subject Domain: A Case of 
Japanese Terms 
As we saw in Table 4, Japanese technical terms are 
often phonetically translated, but less so in archi-
tecture than in the other two fields. To gain a better 
idea of the distribution of phonetic adoption, we 
surveyed the entire Japanese lexicon for all subject 
domains. Table 5 gives the rate of katakana usage, 
that is, the rate of words written in the katakana 
script used for transcribing foreign words. 
 
Table 5. Rate of katakana Usage 
Subject Domain # of terms Katakana Rate 
architecture 1,798 147 0.081
chemistry 958 234 0.244
civil engineering 1,263 156 0.123
telecommunications 1,410 422 0.299
computer science 1,538 650 0.422
control engineering 1,545 497 0.321
electronics 1,200 250 0.208
maritime science 1,403 51 0.036
mathematics 1,284 50 0.038
mechanical engineering 1,186 385 0.324
physics 945 120 0.126
 
The domains of computer science, control engi-
neering and mechanical engineering include over 
30% of katakana words in their terms. In contrast, 
the percentage of katakana terms in architecture, 
mathematics and maritime science domains is less 
than 10%, indicating that these domains are highly 
semantically adopted in their terms, or have little 
need for imported vocabulary. We thus see that 
academic domain affects the adoption of phoneti-
cally translated terms. 
3.3 Mathematical Terms at Different Grade 
Level 
We have collected about 1,300 terms in mathemat-
ics for our multilingual engineering dictionary. 
Following the Japanese course of study3 for grades 
1-12, we chose 57 terms from our dictionary and 
compared those terms with their counterparts in 
Thai and Vietnamese. For university-level mathe-
matical terms, following the syllabus of the 1st year 
of the Faculty of Mathematics in one Japanese 
University, we chose 11 terms4. Then we also sur-
veyed those terms in the same way. Table 6 exam-
ines the terms used in various grade levels.

These data indicate that all languages use either 
original or semantically adopted from elementary 
level to junior-high school level. For Japanese al-
most all words are Sino-Japanese; in oral instruc-
tion native words may be used in Japan but those 
are not used as keywords. As for high school, some 
words phonetically translated from English are 
used in Thai, while at university level all languages 
use English-origin words. As for the rate of Sino-
Vietnamese words in mathematics, it is considera-
bly higher than other categories. This suggests that 
the likelihood that Sino-origin words can be shared

effectively in other countries using Chinese charac-
ters is generally high in the field of mathematics.  
3.4 Web Presence of English Terms and their 
Adopted Equivalents  
We also examined the web presence of pairs of 
terms, an English word and its equivalent in the 
host language. This is an attempt to find how 
widely the source language approach ? direct use 
of foreign language ? is used in technological top-
ics. Four words from different subject domains 
were chosen, and a search was carried out for the 
term (as an exact phrase) using the Google search 
engine (Table 7).

While data are limited to just four terms, general 
trends can be identified. For Japanese pages, while 
there were many hits for English, the hits for Japa-
nese terms were at least three times higher. Inter-
estingly, for operand, the one term with two 
equivalents, the katakana (i.e., phonetically 
adopted) term was used far more frequently than 
the semantically adopted kanji term. In the Viet-
namese pages, while far fewer total hits were made, 
the Vietnamese terms were overwhelmingly more 
frequent than English terms. For Thai pages the 
opposite was found, with the exception of auto-
matic lathe, a tool that may require marketing in 
the local language. These results suggest that the 
major language of technology for Thailand is Eng-
lish, for Vietnam it is the native language, and for 
Japan there is English use but Japanese dominates. 
In order to find if there is a distinction between 
use in technological fields and in general use, we 
made a comparison using three non-technical terms 
(Table 8).

Again, we find that Japanese pages use the 
Japanese word far more frequently (although zoo is 
nearly equal ? perhaps due to the exotic appeal of a 
foreign word, and one understood by almost every 
Japanese) but that English words have a sizable 
presence. For Vietnamese pages, the number of 
hits is substantially higher than that for the techni-
cal terms, but the same trend exists: the native lan-
guage dominates. Finally, for Thai pages, the hits 
for Thai words far exceed those for English words 
in all three cases, although English words are often 
used.  
A comparison of results for Tables 7 and 8 con-
firms that the role of languages differs between 
daily use and situations that require technical ter-
minology, even in a country that has adopted the 
third approach of using a foreign language for sci-
ence and technology. 
4  Social and Academic Factors 
4.1 High Rate of Semantic Adoption in Asian 
Countries 
As can be imagined, it is not easy for Asian people 
to understand technical terms in other Asian lan-
guages, because semantic adoption is popular 
among Asian languages. The diversity of scripts in 
Asia is another reason of this difficulty. In Euro-
pean countries, term-sharing by phonetic adoption 
is easier because almost all languages were derived 
from the same origin and are sharing the same 
script. Therefore, in order to achieve mutual com-
munication using technical terms in Asian coun-
tries, we need to make special efforts to go over 
the variation and harmonize terms each other.  
But we need to discuss why those languages pre-
fer semantic adoption. Various social, political, 
and historical factors influence language use. This 
applies also to the adoption of technical terminol-
ogy. Here, we discuss influences of these factors 
on the approaches used to adopt technical terms, 
including the influence of technical domains and 
academic discipline.  
4.2 Language Policies and Historical Back-
ground 
4.2.1 Vietnam 
In Vietnam, adoption is strongly promoted under 
the strict language policy. The Political Resume of 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam states that 
?[e]very nationality has the right to use its own 
language and system of writing, to preserve its na-
tional identity, and to promote its fine customs, 
habits, traditions and culture.? Therefore they sel-
dom use phonetically adopted words as such. One 
example of its limited use is ??m? from the English 
?ohm.? Another example is proper nouns, when 
foreign words are used in newspapers This politi-
cal reason is the primary impetus for the semantic 
adoption of terms.  
Secondly, as in other communist nations, Eng-
lish is not taught as an obligatory subject in Viet-
nam. This educational policy also brings about a 
low rate of phonetically adopted words from Eng-
lish, because many people cannot grasp the mean-
ing. 
Thirdly, we need to consider that the Vietnam-
ese language has been historically influenced by 
several foreign languages, as we can induce from 
Table 4?s results. Vietnam was under the influence 
of China for approximately 1,000 years. A number 
of Chinese terms were absorbed into Vietnamese 
as Sino-Vietnamese words. During the French co-
lonial period, the Vietnamese language added 
French words for the manufacture of specific 
products such as automobiles and bicycles. Lastly, 
at the end of the 20th century Russian technical 
terms were introduced by people who had studied 
in or technical advisers who had sent by the Soviet 
Union or in Russia 
4.2.2 Japan 
As is the case with Vietnam, Chinese characters 
and words were imported from China so long ago 
that the characters and words are regarded as part 
of the native Japanese language. In the end of the 
19th century, a number of Japanese-kango (words 
that used Chinese characters but were created by 
Japanese people) were invented as adoptions of 
western technical terms, and many of these terms 
were re-imported to China.  
After World War?, Japan was occupied by the 
Allied Forces led by the United States and English 
became a compulsory subject from junior high 
school. English-origin words became easy to un-
derstand for many Japanese. This historical change 
caused a sharp rise in percentage of phonetic adop-
tions from English among Japanese technical terms 
(see Table 5) (Hashimoto 2007). However, English 
is not usually used as an instructional medium in 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, 2008

Japanese institutions of higher education. Teachers 
and students know many English loan terms but 
they use these loan terms not as English but as 
Japanese, and since they are pronounced according 
to Japanese phonetic rules, they may not even be 
intelligible to English speakers.  
4.2.2 Thai 
Thai has different features from the other two 
countries in that it is less influenced by Chinese. 
But the Thai language has been influenced by an-
other foreign language, Sanskrit, the classical In-
dian language. We did not examine the rate of San-
skrit origin words in the Thai language in this 
study, but it seems likely that a high rate of terms 
phonetically adopted from Sanskrit will be found 
in our engineering dictionary. Although Thai has 
native-language equivalents at the lexical level, 
English is daily used as an instructional medium in 
higher education. Students in Thailand start to 
learn English at 10 years old or earlier. Thus, even 
though they have native terms they prefer to use 
terms phonetically adopted from English or to use 
English. 
4.3 Other Factors 
4.3.1 When the subject was introduced?  
In the Meiji era (1868-1912) in Japan, experts 
translated technical terms from Western languages 
semantically, into Japanese-kango. Since World 
War II, however, it has been the mainstream to 
transliterate into katakana. Therefore a decisive 
factor in adoption approach is when the subject 
was introduced into Japan. Table 9 shows the 
foundation year for major academic societies and 
institutes in engineering fields, which roughly in-
dicates the time of introduction of the subject. 
As shown in Table 5, computer science is the 
field that uses technical terms in katakana most 
frequently, while the sampled vocabulary from 
telecommunications also includes nearly 30% of 
katakana words. These disciplines are relatively 
newly developed in Japan; the societies or insti-
tutes related to these fields were established in the 
latter half of the 20th century.  
The oldest societies, the Mathematical Society 
of Japan and The Physical Society of Japan, were 
established in 1877; our study showed that only 
3.8% of mathematical terms and 12.6% of terms in 
physics are phonetically adopted terms. Therefore, 
disciplines with academic societies established 
relatively early may have developed a great deal of 
their terminology during the Meiji era, and may 
still have a preference for Japanese-kango over 
katakana. Newer disciplines, on the other hand, 
may have found it easier to use the imported terms 
in a relatively direct way.

4.3.2. Is it indigenous? 
Each country has specific characteristics of the 
region, such as regional climate, folk, culture, life-
style and other indigenous factors. Technical terms 
in these fields are therefore strongly connected 
with regional characteristics. Before unfamiliar 
terms or new technologies were brought over to the 
host country, experts in those fields had already 
created and used their own technical terms in their 
native language, and also they were already aware 
of the concept of a thing indicated by an unfamiliar 
term in alien language. All they had to do was to 
make a one-to-one correspondence and correctly 
translate a foreign term into the term that was al-
ready in use in the mother tongue.

5 Conclusion 
This preliminary study looks at the different ap-
proaches to adopting technical terms in three Asian 
languages. The three languages investigated prefer 
different methods: Vietnamese tends to adopt 
words into its language semantically, through 
adoption, while Japanese adopts them phonetically, 
through transliteration. Thai, to a large extent, has 
chosen a third approach, that of using a source lan-
guage (English). 
In Japanese and in Vietnamese, many terms sub-
ject to semantic adoption were translated into Chi-
nese characters. This suggests that Sino-words may 
be an effective way of communicating concepts 
among certain language users in certain disciplines, 
such as mathematics. 
The effect of grade level was also investigated, 
and it was found that native language terms were 
used in mathematics almost exclusively until high 
school or university level. 
Subject domain was found to have an effect on 
the adoption approach and was often influenced by 
whether the domain had a long tradition, and when 
established a discipline was (as shown by the 
foundation of academic societies). A domain effect 
was seen in Vietnamese, where Russian or French-
origin terms appeared in different domains. 
While quite limited in scope, this study has re-
vealed clear trends that deserve further investiga-
tion.  
6 Future Research  
We plan to investigate more fully the rate of pho-
netically translated words and approach to termi-
nology adoption. We expect that Chinese and Ko-
rean will give us further evidence of widespread 
use of Sino-words and Mongolian will provide 
data for phonetic adoption from Russian. Malay 
and Filipino are likely to be highly influenced by 
English, while we will find the influence of San-
skrit in Myanmar and Sinhalese.
