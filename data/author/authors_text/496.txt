Abstract
We are interested in contributing a small, publicly
available Urdu corpus of written text to the natu-
ral language processing community. The Urdu
text is stored in the Unicode character set, in its
native Arabic script, and marked up according to
the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) XML Docu-
ment Type Definition (DTD). All the tags and
metadata are in English. To date, the corpus is
made entirely of data from British Broadcasting
Company?s (BBC) Urdu Web site, although we
plan to add data from other Urdu newspapers.
Upon completion, the corpus will consist mostly
of raw Urdu text marked up only to the paragraph
level so it can be used as input for natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tasks. In addition, it will
be hand-tagged for parts of speech so the data can
be used to train and test NLP  tools.
Introduction
We are interested in contributing a small, publicly
available Urdu corpus of written text to the natu-
ral language processing community. In pursuit of
natural language processing research in Urdu, we
could not find a publicly available Urdu corpus
with which to work, so we had to start our own to
train and test machine learning algorithms.
The language engineering community seems
anxious to move forward fast in research of South
Asian languages, but cannot because corpora of
South Asian languages are not ample. ?There is a
dearth of work on Indic languages. The need to
focus on Indic languages was further strengthened
by our major review (with over 80 research cen-
tres world wide responding) of the needs of the
[language engineering] community. Indic lan-
guages are the ones that most researchers want to
work with but cannot because lack of corpus re-
sources? [1].
1 Urdu corpus
Our corpus is currently made up of newspaper
articles and columns from the Urdu Internet site
of the British Broadcasting Company (BBC Urdu).
News story data is easy to gather because it is
readily available on the Internet and already in
electronic form, although Web sites in Urdu tend
to be published in graphics (a point we will return
to later).
It is important for the users of corpus data to
know from where the data came. Software trained
on a written text corpus will perform poorly on
spoken data and vice versa.
Something to keep in mind when using this
Urdu data is that vocabulary and the stylistics of
news stories in Urdu are very different than in
everyday speech. For example, in Urdu news sto-
ries, ?militants? are described as ?people who like
violence? 	
  . Such a phrase is hardly
ever used in everyday speech. Headings of news
stories have different stylistics. For example, a
common way to associate a statement to the per-
son who made the statement is to write the state-
ment followed by a colon or dash and then the
person?s name. This trend has been observed in
Urdu news stories published in Pakistan, India,
the UK, and in the United States.
The first version of the Urdu corpus to be pub-
lished will be relatively small (20,000?50,000
words), but we will regularly be adding to the
corpus as time passes. It  will publicly available at
http://personal1.stthomas.edu/dmbecker/.
All the Urdu documents will appear in a mini-
mally tagged format (i.e., only paragraph tags)
and, in addition, will be hand-tagged for parts of
speech.
2 XML
The natural choice these days for storing a corpus
is in an XML format. An XML format provides
needed standardization so that a user who is un-
familiar with the corpus data, but familiar with a
given XML DTD, can interface with the corpus
fairly efficiently. At its best, software that has
been previously designed to handle a corpus
marked up in a given XML structure can handle a
new corpus marked up in the same structure. This
is advantageous because someone does not have
to comb through the new corpus trying to under-
stand its design in order to redesign the software
that interfaces with the corpus. The designer of a
corpus is always familiar with his/her own design,
so one advantage of using an XML language to
mark up a corpus is to make the corpus readily
available to other researchers.
We chose the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES)
XML DTD  to mark up our corpus [2]. The main
enclosing tag in this DTD  is <cesCorpus> which
is broken into main parts, <cesHeader> and
<cesDoc>.
The header <cesHeader> contains meta in-
formation about the corpus data such as, date cre-
ated, creator?s name and contact information, de-
scription of the source, categories of the content,
the writing system of the language being stored,
how hyphenation in the source text is handled,
and much more information (Figure 1).
The document tag <cesDoc> is where the ac-
tual text of the language of interest is stored. Each
document is itself marked up with metadata spe-
cific to each document, like topic and source in-
formation for every separate document in the cor-
pus.
The language data inside the <cesDoc> tags
can be marked up simply with a paragraph tag
<p> (Figure 2) or they can be more elaborately
marked up with tags of semantic value (e.g., date,
number, measure, name, term, time, foreign
word) and formatting value (e.g., figure, table, p,
sp, div, caption) (Figure 3). Tags that indicate
formatting features such as ?caption? are impor-
tant because they can be used, for example, to
automatically determine the topic of a story.
The actual implementation of tagging Urdu
script at a detailed level presents a display prob-
lem for our XML editor of choice, XML Spy. Upon
looking at Figure 3, which is an excerpt from XML
Spy, one may think that the word order of the
paragraph is out of order. At the display level, the
word order is out of order?it is barely human-
readable, but at the storage level, the text is per-
fectly tagged and will process correctly. In Figure
4, we show, in a human-readable format, the or-
der in which the Urdu text and English tags are
stored. If an XML editor were optimized to display
a right-to-left language with left-to-right tags, this
is how we imagine the text would look. More im-
portantly though, this is the order in which XML
Spy currently stores the Urdu corpus.
We began the corpus building process by stor-
ing Urdu documents at the paragraph level with
no other tags peppering the data. However, we
intend to hand tag the data for parts of speech so
the data can be used to train and test natural lan-
guage processing algorithms.
