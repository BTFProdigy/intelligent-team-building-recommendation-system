Abstract
This paper describes the UMCC-DLSI
system in SemEval-2010 task number 17
(All-words Word Sense Disambiguation
on Specific Domain). The main purpose
of this work is to evaluate and compare
our computational resource of WordNet?s
mappings using 3 different methods:
Relevant Semantic Tree, Relevant
Semantic Tree 2 and an Adaptation of
k-clique?s Technique. Our proposal is
a non-supervised and knowledge-based
system that uses Domains Ontology and
SUMO.
1 Introduction
Ambiguity is the task of building up multiple
alternative linguistic structures for a single
input (Kozareva et al, 2007). Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling-
technology that automatically chooses the
intended sense of a word in context. In this task,
one of the most used lexical data base is WordNet
(WN) (Fellbaum, 1998). WN is an online lexical
reference system whose design is inspired by
current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
memory. Due to the great popularity of WN
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), several
authors (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000), (Niles
and Pease, 2001), (Niles and Pease, 2003),
(Valitutti, 2004) have proposed to incorporate to
the semantic net of WN, some taxonomies that
characterize, in one or several concepts, the senses
of each word. In spite of the fact that there have
been developed a lot of WordNet?s mappings,
there isn?t one unique resource to integrate all
of them in a single system approach. To solve
this need we have developed a resource that joins
WN1, the SUMO Ontology2, WordNet Domains3
and WordNet Affect4. Our purpose is to test the
advantages of having all the resources together for
the resolution of the WSD task.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we describe the architecture of the
integrative resource. Our approach is shown in
Section 3. Next section presents the obtained
results and a discussion. And finally the
conclusions in Section 5.
2 Background and techniques
2.1 Architecture of the integrative resource
Our integrative model takes WN 1.6 as nucleus
and links to it the SUMO resource. Moreover,
WordNet Domains 2.0 (WND) and WordNet
Affect 1.1 (WNAffects) are also integrated but
mapped instead to WN 2.0. From the model
showed in Figure 1, a computational resource has
been built in order to integrate the mappings above
mentioned.
The model integrator?s proposal provides
a software that incorporates bookstores of
programming classes, capable to navigate inside
the semantic graph and to apply any type of
possible algorithm to a net. The software
architecture allows to update WN?s version.
In order to maintain the compatibility with other
resources mapped to WN, we have decided to use
WN 1.6 version. However, the results can be
offered in anyone of WN?s versions.

2.2 The k-clique?s Technique
Formally, a clique is the maximum number of
actors who have all possible ties presented among
themselves. A ?Maximal complete sub-graph? is
such a grouping, expanded to include as many
actors as possible.
?A k-clique is a subset of vertices C such that,
for every i, j ? C, the distance d(i, j)
k
. The 1-
clique is identical to a clique, because the distance
between the vertices is one edge. The 2-clique
is the maximal complete sub-graph with a path
length of one or two edges?. (Cavique et al, 2009)
3 The Proposal
Our proposal consists in accomplishing three runs
with different algorithms. Both first utilize the
domain?s vectors; the third method utilizes k-
cliques? techniques.
This work is divided in several stages:
1. Pre-processing of the corpus (lemmatization
with Freeling) (Atserias et al, 2006).
2. Context selection (For the first (3.1), and
the third (3.3) run the context window was
constituted by the sentence that contains
the word to disambiguate; in the second
run the context window was constituted
by the sentence that contains the word to
disambiguate, the previous sentence and the
next one).
3. Obtaining the domain vector, this vector is
used in first and the second runs (when
the lemma of the words in the analyzed
sentence is obtained, the integrative resource
of WordNet?s Mappings is used to get the
respective senses from each lemma).
4. Obtaining the all resource vector: SUMO,
Affects, and Domain resource. This is only
for the third run (3.3).
5. Relevant Semantic Tree construction
(Addition of concepts parents to the vectors.
For the first (3.1) and second (3.2) runs only
Domain resource is used; for the third (3.3)
run all the resources are used).
6. Selection of the correct senses (the first and
the second runs use the same way to do the
selection; the third run is different. We make
an exception: For the verb ?be? we select the
sense with the higher frequency according to
Freeling.
3.1 Relevant Semantic Tree
With this proposal we measure how much a
concept is correlated to the sentence, similar to
Reuters Vector (Magnini et al, 2002), but with
a different equation. This proposal has a partial
similarity with the Conceptual Density (Agirre
and Rigau, 1996) and DRelevant (Va?zquez et al,
2004) to get the concepts from a hierarchy that
they associate with the sentence.
In order to determine the Association Ratio
(RA) of a domain in relation to the sentence, the
Equation 1 is used.
RA(D, f) =
n
?
i=1
RA(D, f
i
) (1)
where:
RA(D,w) = P (D,w) ? log
2
P (D,w)
P (D)
(2)
f : is a set of words w.
f
i
: is a i-th word of the phrase f .
P (D,w): is joint probability distribution.
P (D): is marginal probability.
From now, vectors are created using the
Senseval-2?s corpus. Next, we show an example:
For the phrase: ?But it is unfair to dump
on teachers as distinct from the educational
establishment?.
By means of the process Pres-processing
analyzed in previous stage 1 we get the lemma and
the following vector.
428
Phrase [unfair; dump; teacher, distinct,
educational; establishment]
Each lemma is looked for in WordNet?s
integrative resource of mappings and it is
correlated with concepts of WND.

Table 1: Initial Domain Vector
After obtaining the Initial Domain Vector we
apply the Equation 3 in order to build the Relevant
Semantic Tree related to the phrase.
DN(CI,Df) = RA CI ?
MP (CI,Df)
TD
(3)
Where DN : is a normalized distance
CI: is the Initial Concept which you want to
add the ancestors.
Df : is Parent Domain.
RA CI: is a Association Ratio of the child
Concept.
TD: is Depth of the hierarchic tree of the
resource to use.
MP : is Minimal Path.
Applying the Equation 3 the algorithm to decide
which parent domain will be added to the vector is
shown here:
if (DN(CI,Df) > 0)
{
if ( Df not exist)
Df is added to the vector with DN value;
else
Df value = Df value + DN ;
}
As a result the Table 2 is obtained.
This vector represents the Domain tree
associated to the phrase.
After the Relevant Semantic Tree is obtained,
the Domain Factotum is eliminated from the tree.
Due to the large amount of WordNet synsets,

that do not belong to a specific domain, but
rather they can appear in almost all of them, the
Factotum domain has been created. It basically
includes two types of synsets: Generic synsets,
which are hard to classify in a particular domain;
and Stop Senses synsets which appear frequently
in different contexts, such as numbers, week
days, colors, etc. (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000),
(Magnini et al, 2002). Words that contain this
synsets are frequently in the phrases, therefore the
senses associated to this domain are not selected.
After processing the patterns that characterize
the sentence, the following stage is to determine
the correct senses, so that the next steps ensue:
1. Senses that do not coincide with the
grammatical category of Freeling are
removed.
429
2. For each word to disambiguate all candidate
senses are obtained. Of each sense
the relevant vector are obtained using the
Equation 4, and according to the previous
Equation 3 parent concepts are added.
RA(D, s) = P (D, s) ? log
2
P (D, s)
P (D)
(4)
where s: is a sense of word.
P (D, s): is joint probability distribution
between Domain concept D and the sense s.
P (D): is marginal probability of the Domain
concept.
3. The one that accumulates the bigger value of
relevance is assigned as correct sense. The
following process is applied:
For each coincidence of the elements in the
senses? domain vector with the domain vector
of the sentence, the RA value of the analyzed
elements is accumulated. The process is
described in the Equation 5.
AC(s, V RA) =
?
k
V RA[V s
k
]
?
i=1
V RA
i
(5)
where AC: The RA value accumulated for
the analyzed elements.
V RA: Vector of relevant domains of the
sentence with the format: V RA [domain ?
value RA].
V s: Vector of relevant domain of the sense
with the format: V s [domain].
V s
k
: Is a k-th domain of the vector V s.
V RA[V s
k
]: Represents the value of RA
assigned to the domain V sk for the value
V RA.
The
?
i=1
V RA
i
term normalizes the result.
3.2 Relevant Semantic Tree 2
This run is the same as the first one with a
little difference, the context window is constituted
by the sentence that contains the word to
disambiguate, the previous sentence and the next
one.
3.3 Adaptation of k-clique?s technique to the
WSD
They are applied, of the section 3, the steps from
the 1 to the 5, where the semantic trees of concepts
are obtained.
Then they are already obtained for all the
words of the context, all the senses discriminated
according to Freeling (Atserias et al, 2006).
Then a sentence?s net of knowledge is built
by means of minimal paths among each sense
and each concept at trees. Next the k-clique?s
technique is applied to the net of knowledge to
obtain cohesive subsets of nodes.
To obtain the correct sense of each word it is
looked, as proposed sense, the sense belonging to
the subset containing more quantities of nodes and
if it has more than a sense for the same word,
the more frequent sense is chosen according to
Freeling.
4 Results and Discussion
The conducted experiments measure the
influence of the aforementioned resources in
the disambiguation task. We have evaluated them
individually and as a whole. In the Table 3 it
is represented each one of the inclusions and
combinations experimented with the Relevant
Semantic Tree method.

Table 3: Evaluation of integrated resources
As it can be observed, in the evaluation for
specific domain corpus the best results are reached
when only domain resource is used. But this
is not a conclusion about the resources inclusion
because the use of this method for global domain,
for example with the task English All words from
Senseval-2 (Agirre et al, 2010), the experiment
adding all the resources showed good results. This
is due to the fact that the global domain includes
information of different contexts, exactly what
is representing in the mentioned resources. For
430
this reason, in the experiment with global domain
and the inclusion of all the resource obtained
better results than using this method with specific
domain, 42% of recall and 45% of precision
(Gutie?rrez, 2010).
For example, with the k-clique?s technique,
utilizing the English All word task from Senseval-
2?s corpus, the results for the test with global
dominion were: with single domain inclusion 40
% of precision and recall; but with the three
resources 41.7 % for both measures.
Table 4 shows the obtained results for the test
data set. The average performance of our system
is 32% and we ranked on 27-th position from
27 participating systems. Although, we have
used different sources of information and various
approximations, in the future we have to surmount
a number of obstacles.
One of the limitations comes from the usage
of the POS-tagger Freeling which introduces
some errors in the grammatical discrimination.
Representing a loss of 3.7% in the precision of our
system.
The base of knowledge utilized in the task was
WordNet 1.6; but the competition demanded the
results with WordNet 3.0. In order to achieve
this we utilized mappings among versions where
119 of 1398 resulting senses emitted by Semeval-
2 were did not found. This represents an 8.5%.
In our proposal, the sense belonging to the
Factotum Domain was eliminated, what disabled
that the senses linked to this domain went
candidates to be recovered. 777 senses of 1398
annotated like correct for Semeval-2 belong to
domain Factotum, what represents that the 66%
were not recovered by our system. Considering
the senses that are not correlated to Factotum,
that is, that correlate to another domains, we are
speaking about 621 senses to define; The system
would emit results of a 72,4%. Senses selected
correctly were 450, representing a 32%. However,
189 kept on like second candidates to be elected.
This represents a 13.5%. If a technique of more
precise decision takes effect, the results of the
system could be increased largely.
5 Conclusion and future works
For our participation in the Semeval-2 task
17 (All-words Word Sense Disambiguation on

conducted an experimental study with the trail

approach can be improved with the incorporation
of more granularities in the hierarchy of WordNet
Domains. Because it was demonstrated that
to define correct senses associated to specific
domains an improvement of 72.4% is obtained.
At this moment, only domain information is used
in our first and second method. Besides was
demonstrated for specific domains, the inclusion
of several resources worsened the results with the
first and second proposal method, the third one has
been not experimented yet. Despite the fact that
we have knowledge of SUMO, WordNet-Affect
and WordNet Domain in our third method we still
not obtain a relevant result.
It would be convenient to enrich our resource
with other resources like Frame-Net, Concept-Net
or others with the objective of characterizing even
more the senses of the words.

Abstract 
This paper describes the specifications and 
results of UMCC_DLSI system, which 
participated in the first Semantic Textual 
Similarity task (STS) of SemEval-2012. Our 
supervised system uses different kinds of 
semantic and lexical features to train classifiers 
and it uses a voting process to select the correct 
option. Related to the different features we can 
highlight the resource ISR-WN1 used to extract 
semantic relations among words and the use of 
different algorithms to establish semantic and 
lexical similarities. In order to establish which 
features are the most appropriate to improve 
STS results we participated with three runs 
using different set of features. Our best 
approach reached the position 18 of 89 runs, 
obtaining a general correlation coefficient up to 
0.72. 
1. Introduction 
SemEval 2012 competition for evaluating Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) systems presents a 
new task called Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) 
(Agirre et al, 2012). In STS the participating 
systems must examine the degree of semantic 
equivalence between two sentences. The goal of 
this task is to create a unified framework for the 
evaluation of semantic textual similarity modules 
and to characterize their impact on NLP 
applications. 
STS is related to Textual Entailment (TE) and 
Paraphrase tasks. The main difference is that STS 
                                                   
1 Integration of Semantic Resource based on WordNet. 
assumes bidirectional graded equivalence between 
the pair of textual snippets. In the case of TE the 
equivalence is directional (e.g. a student is a 
person, but a person is not necessarily a student). 
In addition, STS differs from TE and Paraphrase in 
that, rather than being a binary yes/no decision, 
STS is a similarity-graded notion (e.g. a student 
and a person are more similar than a dog and a 
person). This bidirectional gradation is useful for 
NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, 
Information Extraction, Question Answering, and 
Summarization. Several semantic tasks could be 
added as modules in the STS framework, ?such as 
Word Sense Disambiguation and Induction, 
Lexical Substitution, Semantic Role Labeling, 
Multiword Expression detection and handling, 
Anaphora and Co-reference resolution, Time and 
Date resolution and Named Entity Recognition, 
among others?2  
1.1. Description of 2012 pilot task 
In STS, all systems were provided with a set of 
sentence pairs obtained from a segmented corpus. 
For each sentence pair, s1 and s2, all participants 
had to quantify how similar s1 and s2 were, 
providing a similarity score. The output of 
different systems was compared to the manual 
scores provided by SemEval-2012 gold standard 
file, which range from 5 to 0 according to the next 
criterions3:  
? (5) ?The two sentences are equivalent, as they 
mean the same thing?.

? (0) ?The two sentences are on different topics?. 
After this introduction, the rest of the paper is 
organized as follows. Section 2 shows the 
architecture of our system and a description of the 
different runs. In section 3 we describe the 
algorithms and methods used to obtain the features 
for our system, and Section 4 describe the training 
phase. The obtained results and a discussion are 
provided in Section 5, and finally the conclusions 
and future works in Section 6. 
2. System architecture and description of 
the runs 
As we can see in Figure 1 our three runs begin 
with the pre-processing of SemEval 2012?s 
training set. Every sentence pair is tokenized, 
lemmatized and POS tagged using Freeling tool 
(Atserias et al, 2006). Afterwards, several 
methods and algorithms are applied in order to 
extract all features for our Machine Learning 
System (MLS). Each run uses a particular group of 
features. 
The Run 1 (MultiSemLex) is our main run. 
This takes into account all extracted features and 
trains a model with a Voting classifier composed 
by the following techniques: Bagging (using M5P), 
Bagging (using REPTree), Random SubSpace 
(using REPTree) and MP5. The training corpus has 
been provided by SemEval-2012 competition, in 
concrete by the Semantic Textual Similarity task.  
The Runs 2 and 3 use the same classifier, but 
including different features. Run 2 (MultiLex) uses 
(see Figure 1) features extracted from Lexical-
Semantic Metrics (LS-M) described in section 3.1, 
Lexical-Semantic Alignment (LS-A) described in 
section 3.2 and Sentiment Polarity (SP) described 
in section 3.3.  
On the other hand, the Run 3 (MultiSem) uses 
features extracted only from Semantic Alignment 
(SA) described in section 3.4 and the textual edit 
distances named QGram-Distances. 
 
Figure 1. System Architecture. 
As a result, we obtain three trained models 
capable to estimate the similarity value between 
two sentences. 
Finally, we test our system with the SemEval 
2012 test set (see Table 7 with the results of our 
three runs). The following section describes the

3. Description of the features used in the 
Machine Learning System 
Sometimes, when two sentences are very similar, 
one sentence is in a high degree lexically 
overlapped by the other. Inspired by this fact we 
developed various algorithms, which measure the 
level of overlapping by computing a quantity of 
matching words (the quantity of lemmas that 
correspond exactly by its morphology) in a pair of 
sentences. In our system, we used lexical and 
semantic similarity measures as features for a 
MLS. Other features were extracted from a lexical-
semantic sentences alignment and a variant using 
only a semantic alignment.  
3.1. Similarity measures 
We have used well-known string based similarity 
measures like: Needleman-Wunch (NW) (sequence 
alignment), Smith-Waterman (SW) (sequence 
alignment), Jaro, Jaro-Winkler (JaroW), Chapman-
Mean-Length (CMLength), QGram-Distance 
(QGramD), Block-Distance (BD), Jaccard 
Similarity (JaccardS), Monge-Elkan (ME) and 
Overlap-Coefficient (OC). These algorithms have 
been obtained from an API (Application Program 
Interface) SimMetrics library v1.54 for .NET 2.0. 
Copyright (c) 2006 by Chris Parkinson. We 
obtained 10 features for our MLS from these 
similarity measures. 
Using Levenshtein?s edit distance (LED), we 
computed also two different algorithms in order to 
obtain the alignment of the phrases. In the first 
one, we considered a value of the alignment as the 
LED between two sentences and the normalized 
variant named NomLED. Contrary to (Tatu et al, 
2006), we do not remove the punctuation or stop 
words from the sentences, neither consider 
different cost for transformation operation, and we 
used all the operations (deletion, insertion and 
substitution). The second one is a variant that we 
named Double Levenshtein?s Edit Distance 
(DLED). For this algorithm, we used LED to 
measure the distance between the sentences, but to 
compare the similarity between the words, we used 
LED again. Another feature is the normalized 
variant of DLED named NomDLED. 
The unique difference between classic LED 
algorithm and DLED is the comparison of

 http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/ 
similitude between two words. With LED should 
be: ?[?] = ?[?], whereas for our DLED we 
calculate words similarity also with LED (e.g. ????(?[?], ?[?]) <= 2). Values above a decision 
threshold (experimentally 2) mean unequal words. 
We obtain as result two new different features 
from these algorithms. 
Another distance we used is an extension of 
LED named Extended Distance (EDx) (see 
(Fern?ndez Orqu?n et al, 2009) for details). This 
algorithm is an extension of the Levenshtein?s 
algorithm, with which penalties are applied by 
considering what kind of operation or 
transformation is carried out (insertion, deletion, 
substitution, or non-operation) in what position, 
along with the character involved in the operation. 
In addition to the cost matrixes used by 
Levenshtein?s algorithm, EDx also obtains the 
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) 
(Hirschberg, 1977) and other helpful attributes for 
determining similarity between strings in a single 
iteration. It is worth noting that the inclusion of all 
these penalizations makes the EDx algorithm a 
good candidate for our approach. In our previous 
work (Fern?ndez Orqu?n et al, 2009), EDx 
demonstrated excellent results when it was 
compared with other distances as (Levenshtein, 
1965), (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), (Winkler, 
1999). How to calculate EDx is briefly described 
as follows (we refer reader to (Fern?ndez Orqu?n et 
al., 2009) for a further description): 
EDx = ??  ?????????????,???????(???????)????????? ?? ; (1) 
 
 
Where: ? - Transformations accomplished on the words (?, ?, ?, ?). ? - Not operations at all, ? - Insertion, ? - Deletion, ? - Substitution.  
We formalize ? as a vector: 
? =
???
??(0,0)(1,0) :: ??(0,1)(1,1) :: ?????
??
 
?1 and ?2 - The examined words ?1j - The j-th character of the word ?1 
610
?2k - The k-th character of the word ?2 ? - The weight of each character 
We can vary all this weights in order to make a 
flexible penalization to the interchangeable 
characters.  ??1j - The weight of characters at ?1j ??2k - The weight of characters at ?2k ? = ?? + 1 ?? ?i ? ?? ?? ?i = ? ? ; ? = ?? + 1 ?? ?i ? ?? ?? ?i = ? ? ? - The biggest word length of the language ? - Edit operations length ?i - Operation at (?) position ???? - Greatest value of ? ranking 
? = ? 2????(2???? + 1)???????  (2) 
As we can see in the equation (1), the term ?(??) ? ???????, ?(???)? is the Cartesian product that 
analyzes the importance of doing i-th operation 
between the characters at j-th and k-th position 
The term (2R??? + 1)??? in equation (1) penalizes 
the position of the operations. The most to the left 
hand the operation is the highest the penalization 
is. The term ? (see equation (2) normalizes the 
EDx into [0,1] interval. This measure is also used 
as a feature for the system. 
We also used as a feature the Minimal 
Semantic Distances (Breadth First Search (BFS)) 
obtained between the most relevant concepts of 
both sentences. The relevant concepts pertain to 
semantic resources ISR-WN (Guti?rrez et al, 
2011a; 2010b), as WordNet (Miller et al, 1990), 
WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), 
SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) and Semantic 
Classes (Izquierdo et al, 2007). Those concepts 
were obtained after having applied the Association 
Ratio (AR) measure between concepts and words 
over each sentence. The obtained distances for 
each resource SUMO, WordNet Affect, WordNet 
and Semantic Classes are named SDist, AffDist, 
WNDist and SCDist respectively. 
ISR-WN, takes into account different kind of 
labels linked to WN: Level Upper Concepts 
(SUMO), Domains and Emotion labels. In this 
work, our purpose is to use a semantic network, 
which links different semantic resources aligned to 
WN. After several tests, we decided to apply ISR-
WN. Although others resources provide different 
semantic relations, ISR-WN has the highest 
quantity of semantic dimensions aligned, so it is a 
suitable resource to run our algorithm.  
Using ISR-WN we are able to extract 
important information from the interrelations of 
four ontological resources: WN, WND, WNA and 
SUMO. ISR-WN resource is based on WN1.6 or 
WN2.0 versions. In the last updated version, 
Semantic Classes and SentiWordNet were also 
included. Furthermore, ISR-WN provides a tool 
that allows the navigation across internal links. At 
this point, we can discover the multidimensionality 
of concepts that exists in each sentence. In order to 
establish the concepts associated to each sentence 
we apply Relevant Semantic Trees (Guti?rrez et 
al., 2010a; Guti?rrez et al, 2011b) approach using 
the provided links of ISR-WN. We refer reader to 
(Guti?rrez et al, 2010a) for a further description. 
3.2. Lexical-Semantic alignment 
Another algorithm that we created is the Lexical-
Semantic Alignment. In this algorithm, we tried to 
align the sentences by its lemmas. If the lemmas 
coincide we look for coincidences among parts of 
speech, and then the phrase is realigned using both. 
If the words do not share the same part of speech, 
they will not be aligned. Until here, we only have 
taken into account a lexical alignment. From now 
on, we are going to apply a semantic variant. After 
all the process, the non-aligned words will be 
analyzed taking into account its WorldNet?s 
relations (synonymy, hyponymy, hyperonymy, 
derivationally ? related ? form, similar-to, verbal 
group, entailment and cause-to relation); and a set 
of equivalencies like abbreviations of months, 
countries, capitals, days and coins. In the case of 
the relation of hyperonymy and hyponymy, the 
words will be aligned if there is a word in the first 
sentence that is in the same relation (hyperonymy 
or hyponymy) of another one in the second 
sentence. For the relations of ?cause-to? and 
?implication? the words will be aligned if there is a 
word in the first sentence that causes or implicates 
another one of the second sentence. All the other 
types of relations will be carried out in 
bidirectional way, that is, there is an alignment if a 
word of the first sentence is a synonymous of 
another one belonging to the second one or vice 
versa. Finally, we obtain a value we called 
alignment relation. This value is calculated as ??? =  ??? / ????. Where ??? is the final 
611
alignment value, ??? is the number of aligned 
word and ???? is the number of words of the 
shorter phrase. This value is also another feature 
for our system. 
3.3. Sentiment Polarity Feature 
Another feature is obtained calculating 
SentiWordNet Polarities matches of the analyzed 
sentences (see (Guti?rrez et al, 2011c) for detail). 
This analysis has been applied from several 
dimensions (WordNet, WordNet Domains, 
WordNet Affect, SUMO, and Semantic Classes) 
where the words with sentimental polarity offer to 
the relevant concepts (for each conceptual resource 
from ISR-WN (e.g. WordNet, WordNet Domains, 
WordNet Affect, SUMO, and Semantic Classes)) 
its polarity values. Other analysis were the 
integration of all results of polarity in a measure 
and further a voting process where all polarities 
output are involved (for more details see 
(Fern?ndez et al, 2012)). 
The final measure corresponds to ?? =????? + ?????, where ????1 is a polarity value of 
the sentence ?1 and ????? is a polarity value of the 
sentence ?2. The negative, neutral, and positive 
values of polarities are represented as -1, 0 and 1 
respectively. 
3.4. Semantic Alignment 
This alignment method depends on calculating the 
semantic similarity between sentences based on an 
analysis of the relations, in ISR-WN, of the words 
that fix them. 
First, the two sentences are pre-processed with 
Freeling and the words are classified according to 
their parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, and 
adverbs.).  
We take 30% of the most probable senses of 
every word and we treat them as a group. The 
distance between two groups will be the minimal 
distance between senses of any pair of words 
belonging to the group. For example: 
 
Figure 2. Minimal Distance between ?Run? and 
?Chase?. 
In the example of Figure 2 the ???? = 2 is 
selected for the pair ?Run-Chase?, because this 
pair has the minimal cost=2.  
For nouns and the words that are not found in 
WordNet like common nouns or Christian names, 
the distance is calculated in a different way. In this 
case, we used LED. 
Let's see the following example: 
We could take the pair 99 of corpus MSRvid 
(from training set) with a litter of transformation in 
order to a better explanation of our method. 
Original pair 
A: A polar bear is running towards a group of 
walruses. 
B: A polar bear is chasing a group of walruses. 
Transformed pair: 
A1: A polar bear runs towards a group of cats. 
B1: A wale chases a group of dogs. 
Later on, using the algorithm showed in the 
example of Figure 2, a matrix with the distances 
between all groups of both sentences is created 
(see Table 1). 
GROUPS polar bear runs towards group cats 
wale Dist:=3 Dist:=2 Dist:=3 Dist:=5  Dist:=2 
chases Dist:=4 Dist:=3 Dist:=2 Dist:=4  Dist:=3 
group     Dist:=0  
dogs Dist:=3 Dist:=1 Dist:=4 Dist:=4  Dist:=1 
Table 1. Distances between the groups. 
Using the Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) 
for Minimum Cost Assignment, each group of the 
smaller sentence is checked with an element of the 
biggest sentence and the rest is marked as words 
that were not aligned. 
In the previous example the words ?toward? 
and ?polar? are the words that were not aligned, so 
the number of non-aligned words is 2. There is 
only one perfect match: ?group-group? (match 
with ???? = 0). The length of the shortest sentence 
is 4. The Table 2 shows the results of this analysis.

Table 2. Features extracted from the analyzed sentences. 
This process has to be repeated for the verbs, 
nouns (see Table 3), adjectives, and adverbs. On 
the contrary, the tables have to be created only 
with the similar groups of the sentences. Table 3

Table 4. Feature extracted the analysis of nouns. 
Several attributes are extracted from the pair of 
sentences. Four attributes from the entire 
sentences, four attributes considering only verbs, 
only nouns, only adjectives, and only adverbs. 
These attributes are:  
? Number of exact coincidences (Same) 
? Total distance of optimal matching (Cost). 
? Number of words that do not match (Dif). 
? Number of lemmas of the shortest sentence 
(Min). 
As a result, we finally obtain 20 attributes from 
this alignment method. For each part-of-speech, 
the attributes are represented adding to its names 
the characters N, V, A and R to represent features 
for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs 
respectively. 
It is important to remark that this alignment 
process searches to solve, for each word from the 
rows (see Table 3) its respectively word from the 
columns. 
4. Description of the training phase 
For the training process, we used a supervised 
learning framework, including all the training set 
(MSRpar, MSRvid and SMTeuroparl) as a training 
corpus. Using 10 fold cross validation with the 
classifier mentioned in section 2 (experimentally 
selected). 
As we can see in Table 5, the features: FAV, 
EDx, CMLength, QGramD, BD, Same, SameN, 
obtain values over 0.50 of correlation. The more 
relevant are EDx and QGramD, which were 
selected as a lexical base for the experiment in Run 
3. It is important to remark that feature SameN and 
Same only using number of exact coincidences 
obtain an encourage value of correlation.

Table 5. Correlation of individual features over all training sets. 
 
We decide to include the Sentiment Polarity as 
a feature, because our previous results on Textual 
Entailment task in (Fern?ndez et al, 2012). But, 
contrary to what we obtain in this paper, the 
influence of the polarity (PV) for this task is very 
low, its contribution working together with other 
features is not remarkable, but neither negative 
(Table 6), So we decide remaining in our system. 
In oder to select the lexical base for Run 3 
(MultiSem, features marked in bold) we compared 
the individual influences of the best lexical 
features (EDx, QGramD, CMLength), obtaining 
613
the 0.82, 0.83, 0.81 respectively (Table 6). Finally, 
we decided to use QGramD. 
The conceptual features SDist, AffDist, 
WNDist, SCDist do not increase the similarity 
score, this is due to the generality of the obtained 
concept, losing the essential characteristic between 
both sentences. Just like with PV we decide to 
keep them in our system. 
As we can see in Table 5, when all features are 
taking into account the system obtain the best 
score.

5. Result and discussion 
Semantic Textual Similarity task of SemEval-2012 
offered three official measures to rank the 
systems5: 
1. ALL: Pearson correlation with the gold 
standard for the five datasets, and 
corresponding rank. 
2. ALLnrm: Pearson correlation after the system 
outputs for each dataset are fitted to the gold

standard using least squares, and 
corresponding rank. 
3. Mean: Weighted mean across the five datasets, 
where the weight depends on the number of 
pairs in the dataset. 
4. Pearson for individual datasets. 
Using these measures, our main run (Run 1) 
obtained the best results (see Table 7). This 
demonstrates the importance of tackling this 
problem from a multidimensional lexical-semantic 
point of view.

Table 8. Ranking position of our runs in SemEval 2012. 
The Run 2 uses a lot of lexical analysis and not 
much of semantic analysis. For this reason, the 
results for Run 2 is poorer (in comparison to the 
Run 3) (see Table 7) for the test sets: SMT-eur, 
On-WN and SMT-news. Of course, these tests 
have more complex semantic structures than the 
others. However, for test MSRpar it function better 
and for test MSRvid it functions very similar to 
Run 3. 
Otherwise, the Run 3 uses more semantic 
analysis that Run 2 (it uses all features mentioned 
except feature marked in bold on Table 6) and only 
one lexical similarity measure (QGram-Distance). 
This makes it to work better for test sets SMT-eur, 
On-WN and SMT-news (see Table 7). It is 
important to remark that this run obtains important 
results for the test SMT-news, positioning this 
variant in the fifth place of 89 runs. Moreover, it is 
interesting to notice (Table 7) that when mixing the 
semantic features with the lexical one (creating 
Run 1) it makes the system to improve its general 
results, except for the test: SMT-eur, On-WN and 
SMT-news in comparison with Run 3. For these 
test sets seem to be necessary more semantic 
analysis than lexical in order to improve similarity 
estimation. We assume that Run 1 is non-balance 
according to the quantity of lexical and semantic 
features, because this run has a high quantity of 
614
lexical and a few of semantic analysis. For that 
reason, Run 3 has a better performance than Run 1 
for these test sets. 
Even when the semantic measures demonstrate 
significant results, we do not discard the lexical 
help on Run 3. After doing experimental 
evaluations on the training phase, when lexical 
feature from QGram-Distance is not taken into 
account, the Run 3 scores decrease. This 
demonstrates that at least a lexical base is 
necessary for the Semantic Textual Similarity 
systems. 
6. Conclusion and future works 
This paper introduced a new framework for 
recognizing Semantic Textual Similarity, which 
depends on the extraction of several features that 
can be inferred from a conventional interpretation 
of a text. 
As mentioned in section 2 we have conducted 
three different runs, these runs only differ in the 
type of attributes used. We can see in Table 7 that 
all runs obtained encouraging results. Our best run 
was placed between the first 18th positions of the 
ranking of Semeval 2012 (from 89 Runs) in all 
cases. Table 8 shows the reached positions for the 
three different runs and the ranking according to 
the rest of the teams.  
In our participation, we used a MLS that works 
with features extracted from five different 
strategies: String Based Similarity Measures, 
Semantic Similarity Measures, Lexical-Semantic 
Alignment, Semantic Alignment, and Sentiment 
Polarity Cross-checking. 
We have conducted the semantic features 
extraction in a multidimensional context using the 
resource ISR-WN, the one that allowed us to 
navigate across several semantic resources 
(WordNet, WordNet Domains, WordNet Affect, 
SUMO, SentiWorNet and Semantic Classes). 
Finally, we can conclude that our system 
performs quite well. In our current work, we show 
that this approach can be used to correctly classify 
several examples from the STS task of SemEval-
2012. Comparing with the best run (UKP_Run2 
(see Table 9)) of the ranking our main run has very 
closed results. In two times we increased the best 
UKP?s run (UKP_Run 2), for MSRvid test set in 
0.2824 points and for On-WN test set in 0.1319 
points (see Table 10).

It is important to remark that we do not expand 
any corpus to train the classifier of our system. 
This fact locates us at disadvantage according to 
other teams that do it.

As future work we are planning to enrich our 
semantic alignment method with Extended 
WordNet (Moldovan and Rus, 2001), we think that 
with this improvement we can increase the results 
obtained with texts like those in On-WN test set.

Abstract 
This paper describes the specifications and 
results of UMCC_DLSI system, which 
participated in the Semantic Textual 
Similarity task (STS) of SemEval-2013. Our 
supervised system uses different types of 
lexical and semantic features to train a 
Bagging classifier used to decide the correct 
option. Related to the different features we 
can highlight the resource ISR-WN used to 
extract semantic relations among words and 
the use of different algorithms to establish 
semantic and lexical similarities. In order to 
establish which features are the most 
appropriate to improve STS results we 
participated with three runs using different 
set of features. Our best run reached the 
position 44 in the official ranking, obtaining 
a general correlation coefficient of 0.61. 
1 Introduction 
SemEval-2013 (Agirre et al, 2013) presents the 
task Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) again. In 
STS, the participating systems must examine the 
degree of semantic equivalence between two 
sentences. The goal of this task is to create a 
unified framework for the evaluation of semantic 
textual similarity modules and to characterize 
their impact on NLP applications. 
STS is related to Textual Entailment (TE) and 
Paraphrase tasks. The main difference is that 
STS assumes bidirectional graded equivalence 
between the pair of textual snippets. 
In case of TE, the equivalence is directional 
(e.g. a student is a person, but a person is not 
necessarily a student). In addition, STS differs 
from TE and Paraphrase in that, rather than 
being a binary yes/no decision, STS is a 
similarity-graded notion (e.g. a student is more 
similar to a person than a dog to a person).  
This graded bidirectional is useful for NLP 
tasks such as Machine Translation (MT), 
Information Extraction (IE), Question 
Answering (QA), and Summarization. Several 
semantic tasks could be added as modules in the 
STS framework, ?such as Word Sense 
Disambiguation and Induction, Lexical 
Substitution, Semantic Role Labeling, Multiword 
Expression detection and handling, Anaphora 
and Co-reference resolution, Time and Date 
resolution and Named Entity, among others?1  
1.1 Description of 2013 pilot task 
This edition of SemEval-2013 remain with the 
same classification approaches that in their first 
version in 2012. The output of different systems 
was compared to the reference scores provided 
by SemEval-2013 gold standard file, which 
range from five to zero according to the next 
criterions2: (5) ?The two sentences are 
equivalent, as they mean the same thing?. (4) 
?The two sentences are mostly equivalent, but 
some unimportant details differ?. (3) ?The two 
sentences are roughly equivalent, but some 
important information differs/missing?. (2) ?The 
two sentences are not equivalent, but share some 
details?. (1) ?The two sentences are not

equivalent, but are on the same topic?. (0) ?The 
two sentences are on different topics?. 
After this introduction, the rest of the paper is 
organized as follows. Section 3 shows the 
Related Works. Section 4 presents our system 
architecture and description of the different runs. 
In section 4 we describe the different features 
used in our system. Results and a discussion are 
provided in Section 5 and finally we conclude in 
Section 6. 
2 Related Works 
There are more extensive literature on measuring 
the similarity between documents than to 
between sentences. Perhaps the most recently 
scenario is constituted by the competition of 
SemEval-2012 task 6: A Pilot on Semantic 
Textual Similarity (Aguirre and Cerd, 2012). In 
SemEval-2012, there were used different tools 
and resources like stop word list, multilingual 
corpora, dictionaries, acronyms, and tables of 
paraphrases, ?but WordNet was the most used 
resource, followed by monolingual corpora and 
Wikipedia? (Aguirre and Cerd, 2012). 
According to Aguirre, Generic NLP tools were 
widely used. Among those that stand out were 
tools for lemmatization and POS-tagging 
(Aguirre and Cerd, 2012). On a smaller scale 
word sense disambiguation, semantic role 
labeling and time and date resolution. In 
addition, Knowledge-based and distributional 
methods were highly used. Aguirre and Cerd 
remarked on (Aguirre and Cerd, 2012) that 
alignment and/or statistical machine translation 
software, lexical substitution, string similarity, 
textual entailment and machine translation 
evaluation software were used to a lesser extent. 
It can be noted that machine learning was widely 
used to combine and tune components. 
Most of the knowledge-based methods ?obtain 
a measure of relatedness by utilizing lexical 
resources and ontologies such as WordNet 
(Miller et al, 1990b) to measure definitional 
overlap, term distance within a graphical 
taxonomy, or term depth in the taxonomy as a 
measure of specificity? (Banea et al, 2012). 
Some scholars as in (Corley and Mihalcea, 
June 2005) have argue ?the fact that a 
comprehensive metric of text semantic similarity 
should take into account the relations between 
words, as well as the role played by the various 
entities involved in the interactions described by 
each of the two sentences?. This idea is resumed 
in the Principle of Compositionality, this 
principle posits that the meaning of a complex 
expression is determined by the meanings of its 
constituent expressions and the rules used to 
combine them (Werning et al, 2005). Corley 
and Mihalcea in this article combined metrics of 
word-to-word similarity, and language models 
into a formula and they pose that this is a 
potentially good indicator of the semantic 
similarity of the two input texts sentences. They 
modeled the semantic similarity of a sentence as 
a function of the semantic similarity of the 
component words (Corley and Mihalcea, June 
2005). 
One of the top scoring systems at SemEval-
2012 (?ari? et al, 2012) tended to use most of 
the aforementioned resources and tools. They 
predict the human ratings of sentence similarity 
using a support-vector regression model with 
multiple features measuring word-overlap 
similarity and syntax similarity. They also 
compute the similarity between sentences using 
the semantic alignment of lemmas. First, they 
compute the word similarity between all pairs of 
lemmas from first to second sentence, using 
either the knowledge-based or the corpus-based 
semantic similarity. They named this method 
Greedy Lemma Aligning Overlap. 
Daniel B?r presented the UKP system, which 
performed best in the Semantic Textual 
Similarity (STS) task at SemEval-2012 in two 
out of three metrics. It uses a simple log-linear 
regression model, trained on the training data, to 
combine multiple text similarity measures of 
varying complexity. 
3 System architecture and description 
of the runs 
As we can see in Figure 1, our three runs begin 
with the pre-processing of SemEval-2013?s 
training set. Every sentence pair is tokenized, 
lemmatized and POS-tagged using Freeling 2.2 
tool (Atserias et al, 2006). Afterwards, several 
methods and algorithms are applied in order to 
extract all features for our Machine Learning 
System (MLS). Each run uses a particular group 
of features. 
110
Figure 1. System Architecture. 
The Run 1 (named MultiSemLex) is our main 
run. This takes into account all extracted features 
and trains a model with a Bagging classifier 
(Breiman, 1996) (using REPTree). The training 
corpus has been provided by SemEval-2013 
competition, in concrete by the Semantic Textual 
Similarity task.  
The Run 2 (named MultiLex) and Run 3 
(named MultiSem) use the same classifier, but 
including different features. Run 2 uses (see 
Figure 1) features extracted from Lexical-
Semantic Metrics (LS-M) described in section 
4.1, and Lexical-Semantic Alignment (LS-A) 
described in section 4.2. 
On the other hand, Run 3 uses features 
extracted only from Semantic Alignment (SA) 
described in section 4.3. 
As a result, we obtain three trained models 
capable to estimate the similarity value between 
two phrases. 
Finally, we test our system with the SemEval-
2013 test set (see Table 14 with the results of our 
three runs). The following section describes the 
features extraction process. 
4 Description of the features used in the 
Machine Learning System 
Many times when two phrases are very similar, 
one sentence is in a high degree lexically 
overlapped by the other. Inspired in this fact we 
developed various algorithms, which measure 
the level of overlapping by computing a quantity 
of matching words in a pair of phrases. In our 
system, we used as features for a MLS lexical 
and semantic similarity measures. Other features 
were extracted from a lexical-semantic sentences 
alignment and a variant using only a semantic 
alignment. 
4.1 Similarity measures 
We have used well-known string based 
similarity measures like: Needleman-Wunch 
(sequence alignment), Smith-Waterman 
(sequence alignment), Smith-Waterman-Gotoh, 
Smith-Waterman-Gotoh-Windowed-Affine, 
Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, Chapman-Length-Deviation, 
Chapman-Mean-Length, QGram-Distance, 
Block-Distance, Cosine Similarity, Dice 
Similarity, Euclidean Distance, Jaccard 
Similarity, Matching Coefficient, Monge-Elkan 
and Overlap-Coefficient. These algorithms have 
been obtained from an API (Application 
Program Interface) SimMetrics library v1.5 for 
.NET 2.03. We obtained 17 features for our MLS 
from these similarity measures. 
Using Levenshtein?s edit distance (LED), we 
computed also two different algorithms in order 
to obtain the alignment of the phrases. In the first 
one, we considered a value of the alignment as 
the LED between two sentences. Contrary to 
(Tatu et al, 2006), we do not remove the 
punctuation or stop words from the sentences,

neither consider different cost for transformation 
operation, and we used all the operations 
(deletion, insertion and substitution).  
The second one is a variant that we named 
Double Levenshtein?s Edit Distance (DLED) 
(see Table 9 for detail). For this algorithm, we 
used LED to measure the distance between the 
phrases, but in order to compare the words, we 
used LED again (Fern?ndez et al, 2012; 
Fern?ndez Orqu?n et al, 2009). 
Another distance we used is an extension of 
LED named Extended Distance (in spanish 
distancia extendida (DEx)) (see (Fern?ndez et 
al., 2012; Fern?ndez Orqu?n et al, 2009) for 
details). This algorithm is an extension of the 
Levenshtein?s algorithm, with which penalties 
are applied by considering what kind of 
transformation (insertion, deletion, substitution, 
or non-operation) and the position it was carried 
out, along with the character involved in the 
operation. In addition to the cost matrixes used 
by Levenshtein?s algorithm, DEx also obtains 
the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) 
(Hirschberg, 1977) and other helpful attributes 
for determining similarity between strings in a 
single iteration. It is worth noting that the 
inclusion of all these penalizations makes the 
DEx algorithm a good candidate for our 
approach.  
In our previous work (Fern?ndez Orqu?n et al, 
2009), DEx demonstrated excellent results when 
it was compared with other distances as 
(Levenshtein, 1965), (Neeedleman and Wunsch, 
1970), (Winkler, 1999). We also used as a 
feature the Minimal Semantic Distances 
(Breadth First Search (BFS)) obtained between 
the most relevant concepts of both sentences. 
The relevant concepts pertain to semantic 
resources ISR-WN (Guti?rrez et al, 2011; 
2010a), as WordNet (Miller et al, 1990a), 
WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 
2004), SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) and 
Semantic Classes (Izquierdo et al, 2007). Those 
concepts were obtained after having applied the 
Association Ratio (AR) measure between 
concepts and words over each sentence. (We 
refer reader to (Guti?rrez et al, 2010b) for a 
further description). 
Another attribute obtained by the system was a 
value corresponding with the sum of the smaller 
distances (using QGram-Distance) between the 
words or the lemmas of the phrase one with each 
words of the phrase two. 
As part of the attributes extracted by the 
system, was also the value of the sum of the 
smaller distances (using Levenshtein) among 
stems, chunks and entities of both phrases. 
4.2 Lexical-Semantic alignment 
Another algorithm that we created is the Lexical-
Semantic Alignment. In this algorithm, we tried 
to align the phrases by its lemmas. If the lemmas 
coincide we look for coincidences among parts-
of-speech4 (POS), and then the phrase is 
realigned using both. If the words do not share 
the same POS, they will not be aligned. To this 
point, we only have taken into account a lexical 
alignment. From now on, we are going to apply 
a semantic variant. After all the process, the non-
aligned words will be analyzed taking into 
account its WordNet?s relations (synonymy, 
hyponymy, hyperonymy, derivationally-related-
form, similar-to, verbal group, entailment and 
cause-to relation); and a set of equivalences like 
abbreviations of months, countries, capitals, days 
and currency. In case of hyperonymy and 
hyponymy relation, words are going to be 
aligned if there is a word in the first sentence 
that is in the same relation (hyperonymy or 
hyponymy) with another one in the second 
sentence. For the relations ?cause-to? and 
?implication? the words will be aligned if there 
is a word in the first sentence that causes or 
implicates another one in the second sentence. 
All the other types of relations will be carried 
out in bidirectional way, that is, there is an 
alignment if a word of the first sentence is a 
synonymous of another one belonging to the 
second one or vice versa. 
Finally, we obtain a value we called alignment 
relation. This value is calculated as ??? =
 ??? / ????. Where ??? is the final 
alignment value, ??? is the number of aligned 
words, and ???? is the number of words of the 
shorter phrase. The  ??? value is also another 
feature for our system. Other extracted attributes 
they are the quantity of aligned words and the 
quantity of not aligned words. The core of the 
alignment is carried out in different ways, which 
                                                          
4 (noun, verb, adjective, adverbs, prepositions, 
conjunctions, pronouns, determinants, modifiers, etc.) 
112
are obtained from several attributes.  Each way 
can be compared by: 
? the part-of-speech. 
? the morphology and the part-of-speech. 
? the lemma and the part-of-speech. 
? the morphology, part-of-speech, and 
relationships of WordNet. 
? the lemma, part-of-speech, and 
relationships of WordNet. 
4.3 Semantic Alignment 
This alignment method depends on calculating 
the semantic similarity between sentences based 
on an analysis of the relations, in ISR-WN, of 
the words that fix them. 
First, the two sentences are pre-processed with 
Freeling and the words are classified according 
to their POS, creating different groups. 
The distance between two words will be the 
distance, based on WordNet, of the most 
probable sense of each word in the pair, on the 
contrary of our previously system in SemEval 
2012. In that version, we assumed the selected 
sense after apply a double Hungarian Algorithm 
(Kuhn, 1955), for more details  please refer to 
(Fern?ndez et al, 2012). The distance is 
computed according to the equation (1): 
?(?, ?) = ? ? ? ?(?[?], ?[? + 1])?=??=0 ; (1) 
Where ? is the collection of synsets 
corresponding to the minimum path between 
nodes ? and ?, ? is the length of ? subtracting 
one, ? is a function that search the relation 
connecting ? and ? nodes, ? is a weight 
associated to the relation searched by ? (see 
Table 1).

Table 1. Weights applied to WordNet relations. 
Table 1 shows the weights associated to 
WordNet relations between two synsets. 
Let us see the following example: 
? We could take the pair 99 of corpus 
MSRvid (from training set of SemEval-
2013) with a littler transformation in 
order to a better explanation of our 
method. 
Original pair 
A: A polar bear is running towards a group of 
walruses. 
B: A polar bear is chasing a group of walruses. 
Transformed pair: 
A1: A polar bear runs towards a group of cats. 
B1: A wale chases a group of dogs. 
Later on, using equation (1), a matrix with the 
distances between all groups of both phrases is 
created (see Table 2). 
GROUPS polar bear runs towards group cats 
wale Dist:=3 Dist:=2 Dist:=3 Dist:=5  Dist:=2 
chases Dist:=4 Dist:=3 Dist:=2 Dist:=4  Dist:=3 
group     Dist:=0  
dogs Dist:=3 Dist:=1 Dist:=4 Dist:=4  Dist:=1 
Table 2. Distances between groups. 
Using the Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) 
for Minimum Cost Assignment, each group of 
the first sentence is checked with each element 
of the second sentence, and the rest is marked as 
words that were not aligned. 
In the previous example the words ?toward? 
and ?polar? are the words that were not aligned, 
so the number of non-aligned words is two. 
There is only one perfect match: ?group-group? 
(match with cost=0). The length of the shortest 
sentence is four. The Table 3 shows the results 
of this analysis.

Table 3. Features from the analyzed sentences. 
This process has to be repeated for nouns (see 
Table 4), verbs, adjective, adverbs, prepositions, 
conjunctions, pronouns, determinants, modifiers, 
digits and date times. On the contrary, the tables 
have to be created only with the similar groups 
of the sentences. Table 4 shows features 
extracted from the analysis of nouns.

Table 5. Feature extracted from analysis of nouns. 
Several attributes are extracted from the pair of 
sentences (see Table 3 and Table 5). Three 
attributes considering only verbs, only nouns, 
only adjectives, only adverbs, only prepositions, 
only conjunctions, only pronouns, only 
determinants, only modifiers, only digits, and 
only date times. These attributes are:  
? Number of exact coincidences 
? Total distance of matching 
? Number of words that do not match 
Many groups have particular features 
according to their parts-of-speech. The group of 
the nouns has one more feature that indicates if 
the two phrases have the same number (plural or 
singular). For this feature, we take the average of 
the number of each noun in the phrase like a 
number of the phrase.  
For the group of adjectives we added a feature 
indicating the distance between the nouns that 
modify it from the aligned adjectives, 
respectively.  
For the verbs, we search the nouns that precede 
it, and the nouns that are next of the verb, and 
we define two groups. We calculated the 
distance to align each group with every pair of 
aligned verbs. The verbs have other feature that 
specifies if all verbs are in the same verbal time.  
With the adverbs, we search the verb that is 
modified by it, and we calculate their distance 
from all alignment pairs.  
With the determinants and the adverbs we 
detect if any of the alignment pairs are 
expressing negations (like don?t, or do not) in 
both cases or not. Finally, we determine if the 
two phrases have the same principal action. For 
all this new features, we aid with Freeling tool. 
As a result, we finally obtain 42 attributes from 
this alignment method. It is important to remark 
that this alignment process searches to solve, for 
each word from the rows (see Table 4) it has a 
respectively word from the columns. 
4.4 Description of the alignment feature 
From the alignment process, we extract different 
features that help us a better result of our MLS. 
Table 6 shows the group of features with lexical 
and semantic support, based on WordNet 
relation (named F1). Each of they were named 
with a prefix, a hyphen and a suffix. Table 7 
describes the meaning of every prefix, and Table

Other features we extracted were obtained 
from the following similarity measures (named 
F2) (see Table 9 for detail). 
We used another group named F3, with lexical

Table 10 for detail). 
Finally we used a group of five feature (named 
F4), extracted from all against all alignment (see 
Table 11 for detail). 
4.5 Description of the training phase 
For the training process, we used a supervised 
learning framework, including all the training set 
as a training corpus. Using ten-fold cross 
validation with the classifier mentioned in 
section 3 (experimentally selected). 
As we can see in Table 12, the attributes 
corresponding with the Test 1 (only lexical 
attributes) obtain 0.7534 of correlation. On the 
other side, the attributes of the Test 2 (lexical 
features with semantic support) obtain 0.7549 of 
correlation, and all features obtain 0.7987. Being 
demonstrated the necessity to tackle the problem 
of the similarity from a multidimensional point 
of view (see Test 3 in the Table 12).

5 Result and discussion 
Semantic Textual Similarity task of SemEval-
2013 offered two official measures to rank the 
systems5: Mean- the main evaluation value, 
Rank- gives the rank of the submission as 
ordered by the "mean" result.

Test data for the core test datasets, coming 
from the following: 
Corpus Description 
Headlineas: news headlines mined from several news 
sources by European Media Monitor 
using the RSS feed. 
OnWN: mapping of lexical resources OnWN. The 
sentences are sense definitions from 
WordNet and OntoNotes. 
FNWN: the sentences are sense definitions from 
WordNet and FrameNet. 
SMT: SMT dataset comes from DARPA GALE 
HTER and HyTER. One sentence is a 
MT output and the other is a reference 
translation where a reference is generated 
based on human post editing. 
Table 13. Test Core Datasets. 
Using these measures, our second run (Run 2) 
obtained the best results (see Table 14). As we 
can see in Table 14, our lexical run has obtained 
our best result, given at the same time worth 
result in our other runs. This demonstrates that 
tackling this problem with combining multiple 
lexical similarity measure produce better results 
in concordance to this specific test corpora. 
To explain Table 14 we present following 
descriptions: caption in top row mean: 1- 
Headlines, 2- OnWN, 3- FNWN, 4- SMT and 5- 
mean.

Table 14. Official SemEval-2013 results over test 
datasets. Ranking (R). 
The Run 1 is our main run, which contains the 
junction of all attributes (lexical and semantic 
attributes).  Table 14 shows the results of all the 
runs for a different corpus from test phase. As 
we can see, Run 1 did not obtain the best results 
among our runs. 
Otherwise, Run 3 uses more semantic analysis 
than Run 2, from this; Run 3 should get better 
results than reached over the corpus of FNWN, 
because this corpus is extracted from FrameNet 
corpus (Baker et al, 1998) (a semantic network). 
FNWN provides examples with high semantic 
content than lexical. 
Run 3 obtained a correlation coefficient of 
0.8137 for all training corpus of SemEval 2013, 
115
while Run 2 and Run 1 obtained 0.7976 and 
0.8345 respectively with the same classifier 
(Bagging using REPTree, and cross validation 
with ten-folds). These results present a 
contradiction between test and train evaluation. 
We think it is consequence of some obstacles 
present in test corpora, for example:  
In headlines corpus there are great quantity of 
entities, acronyms and gentilics that we not take 
into account in our system. 
The corpus FNWN presents a non-balance 
according to the length of the phrases. 
In OnWN -test corpus-, we believe that some 
evaluations are not adequate in correspondence 
with the training corpus. For example, in line 7 
the goal proposed was 0.6, however both phrases 
are semantically similar. The phrases are: 
? the act of lifting something 
? the act of climbing something. 
We think that 0.6 are not a correct evaluation 
for this example. Our system result, for this 
particular case, was 4.794 for Run 3, and 3.814 
for Run 2, finally 3.695 for Run 1. 
6 Conclusion and future works 
This paper have introduced a new framework for 
recognizing Semantic Textual Similarity, which 
depends on the extraction of several features that 
can be inferred from a conventional 
interpretation of a text. 
As mentioned in section 3 we have conducted 
three different runs, these runs only differ in the 
type of attributes used. We can see in Table 14 
that all runs obtained encouraging results. Our 
best run was situated at 44th position of 90 runs 
of the ranking of SemEval-2013.  Table 12 and 
Table 14 show the reached positions for the three 
different runs and the ranking according to the 
rest of the teams.  
In our participation, we used a MLS that works 
with features extracted from five different 
strategies: String Based Similarity Measures, 
Semantic Similarity Measures, Lexical-Semantic 
Alignment and Semantic Alignment. 
We have conducted the semantic features 
extraction in a multidimensional context using 
the resource ISR-WN, the one that allowed us to 
navigate across several semantic resources 
(WordNet, WordNet Domains, WordNet Affect, 
SUMO, SentiWordNet and Semantic Classes). 
Finally, we can conclude that our system 
performs quite well. In our current work, we 
show that this approach can be used to correctly 
classify several examples from the STS task of 
SemEval-2013. Compared with the best run of 
the ranking (UMBC_EBIQUITY- ParingWords) 
(see Table 15) our main run has very close 
results in headlines (1), and SMT (4) core test 
datasets.

As future work we are planning to enrich our 
semantic alignment method with Extended 
WordNet (Moldovan and Rus, 2001), we think 
that with this improvement we can increase the 
results obtained with texts like those in OnWN 
test set. 
6.1 Team Collaboration 
Is important to remark that our team has been 
working up in collaboration with INAOE 
(Instituto Nacional de Astrof?sica, ?ptica y 
Electr?nica) and LIPN (Laboratoire 
d'Informatique de Paris-Nord), Universit? Paris 
13 universities, in order to encourage the 
knowledge interchange and open shared 
technology. Supporting this collaboration, 
INAOE-UPV (Instituto Nacional de Astrof?sica, 
?ptica y Electr?nica and Universitat Polit?cnica 
de Val?ncia) team, in concrete in INAOE-UPV-
run 3 has used our semantic distances for nouns, 
adjectives, verbs and adverbs, as well as lexical 
attributes like LevDoble, NormLevF, NormLevL 
and Ext (see influence of these attributes in 
Table 12).

Abstract 
This paper describes the specifications and 
results of UMCC_DLSI-(EPS) system, which 
participated in the first Evaluating Phrasal 
Semantics of SemEval-2013. Our supervised 
system uses different kinds of semantic 
features to train a bagging classifier used to 
select the correct similarity option. Related to 
the different features we can highlight the 
resource WordNet used to extract semantic 
relations among words and the use of different 
algorithms to establish semantic similarities. 
Our system obtains promising results with a 
precision value around 78% for the English 
corpus and 71.84% for the Italian corpus. 
1 Introduction 
It is well known finding words similarity, even 
when it is lexical or semantic can improve 
entailment recognition and paraphrase 
identification; and ultimately lead to improvements 
in a wide range of applications in Natural 
Language Processing (NLP). Several areas like 
question answering, query expansion, information 
retrieval, and many others, depend on phrasal 
semantics (PS). PS, is concerned with how the 
meaning of a sentence is composed both from the 
meaning of the constituent words, and from extra 
meaning contained within the structural 
organization of the sentence itself (Dominey, 
2005). 
The aim of SemEval 2013 competition is also 
discovering similarity, specifically in Evaluating 
Phrasal Semantics (EPS). The goal of this task is to 
evaluate how well systems can judge the semantic 
similarity of a word and a short sequence of words. 
That is, given a set of pairs of this type; classify it 
on negative (if the meaning of the word is 
semantically different to the meaning of the 
sequence) or positive (if the meaning of the 
sequence, as a whole, is semantically close to the 
meaning of the word).  
Based on this, we developed a system capable to 
detect if two phrases are semantically close. 
The rest of this paper, specifically section 2 is a 
brief Related Work. Section 3 describes the system 
architecture and our run. Continuing with section 4 
we describe the training phase. Following that, 
section 5 presents the results and discussion for our 
Machine Learning System. Finally we conclude 
and propose our future works (Section 6). 
2 Related Work 
There have been many WordNet-based similarity 
measures, among other highlights the work of 
researchers like (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; 
Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Mihalcea et al, 
2006; Richardson et al, 1994). 
On the other hand, WordNet::Similarity1 
(Pedersen et al, 2004) has been used by other 
researchers in an interesting array of domains. 
WordNet::Similarity implements measures of 
similarity and relatedness between a pair of 
concepts (or synsets2) based on the structure and 
content of WordNet. According to (Pedersen et al, 
2004), three of the six measures of similarity are 
based on the information content of the least

common subsumer (LCS). These measures include 
res (Resnik, 1995), lin (Lin, 1998), and jcn (Jiang 
and Conrath, 1997). 
Pursuant to Pedersen, there are three other 
similarity measures based on path lengths between 
a pair of concepts: lch (Leacock and Chodorow, 
1998), wup (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and path. 
Our proposal differs from those of 
WordNet::Similarity and other measures of 
similarity in the way we selected the relevant 
WordNet relations (see section 3.2 for detail). 
Unlike others, our measure assign weight to 
WordNet relations (any we consider relevant) 
depending to the place they occupy in the 
minimum path and the previously visited relations. 
Besides these, the novelty of our approach is 
using the weights as a function of semantic 
relations in a minimal distance path and also the 
method we used to arrive to those weight functions 
or rules. 
3 System Architecture and description of 
the run 
As we can see in Figure 1 our run begin with the 
pre-processing of SemEval 2013?s training set. 
Every sentence pair is tokenized, lemmatized and 
POS-tagged using Freeling 2.2 tool (Atserias et al, 
2006). Afterwards, several methods and algorithms 
are applied in order to extract all features for our 
Machine Learning System (MLS). The system 
trains the classifier using a model based on 
bagging (using JRip3). The training corpus has 
been provided by SemEval-2013 competition, in 
concrete by the EPS task. As a result, we obtain a 
trained model capable to detect if one phrase 
implies other. Finally, we test our system with the 
SemEval 2013 test set (see Table 2 with the results 
of our run). The following section describes the 
features extraction process. 
3.1 Description of the features used in the 
Machine Learning System 
In order to detect entailment between a pair of 
phrases, we developed an algorithm that searches a 
semantic distance, according to WordNet (Miller et 
al., 1990), between each word in the first phrase 
with each one in the second phrase. 
We used four features which intend to measure 
the level of proximity between both sentences: 
                                                     
3 JRip is an inference and rules-based learner. 
? The minimum distance to align the first 
phrase with the second (MinDist). See section 
3.2 for details. 
? The maximal distance to align the first phrase 
with the second (MaxDist). 
? The average of all distances results to align 
the first phrase with the second one. 
(AverageDistance). 
? The absolute relative error of all distances 
results to align the first phrase with the 
second respect to the average of them. 
 
Figure 1. System Architecture. 
Other features included are the most frequent 
relations contained in the shorted path of the 
minimum distance; result to align the first phrase 
with the second one. Following table shows the 
relations selected as most frequent. 
A weight was added to each of them, according 
to the place it occupy in the shortest path between 
two synsets. The shortest path was calculated using 
Breadth -First-Search algorithm (BFS) (Cormen et 
al., 2001). 
In addition, there is one feature that takes into 
account any other relationship that is not 
previously considered. 
Finally, as a result we obtain 22 features from 
this alignment method.

3.2 Semantic Distance 
As aforementioned, our distance depends on 
calculating the similarity between sentences, based 
on the analysis of WordNet relations, and we only 
took into account the most frequent ones. When 
searching the shortest path between two WordNet 
synsets, frequents relations were considered the 
ones extracted according to the analysis made in 
the training corpus, provided by SemEval-2013. 
The distance between two synsets is calculated 
with the relations found; and simply it is the sum 
of the weights assigned to each connection. 
????????(?, ?) =  ????????(??, ??), ? (?, ?) (1) 
????????(?, ?) = ???(?? , ??), ?(?, ?) (2) 
???(??; ??) = ? ?(???(?[?], ?[? + 1]))
?=?
?=0
 (3) 
? = ???(??; ??) (4) 
Where ? and ? represents the i-th and j-th sense of 
the word; P and Q represents words collections; ?? 
is the X-th word of ?; ?? is the Y-th word of ?; 
???????? obtains a value that represents a 
minimal semantic distance across WordNet (Miller 
et al, 2006) resource (this resource is involved into 
the integrator resource, ISR-WN (Guti?rrez et al, 
2011a; 2010a); ????????  the minimal semantic 
distance between two words; ??? represents the 
minimal semantic distance between two senses 
collections; ? is a collection of synsets that 
represents the minimal path between two synsets 
using BFS; ??? obtains semantic relation types 
between two synsets; W is a functions that apply 
the rules described in Table 1. The maximum and 
average distance is calculated in a similar fashion 
but using the maximum and average instead of the 
minimum. 
3.3 Semantic Alignment 
First, the two sentences are pre-processed with 
Freeling 2.2 and the words are classified according 
to their parts-of-speech. Then, all senses of every 
word are taken and treated as a group. Distance 
between two groups will be the minimal distance 
(described in 3.1) between senses of any pair of 
words belonging to the group. 
In the example of Figure 2, Dist=280 is selected 
for the pair ?Balance-Culture? (minimal cost).  
Following the explanation on section 3.1 we 
extract the features guided to measure the level of 
proximity between both sentences. 
 
Figure 2. Distance between ?Balance? and ?Culture?. 
A maximum and average distance is calculated in a 
similar fashion, but using the maximum and 
average instead of the minimum. 
4 Description of the training phase 
For the training process, we used a supervised 
learning framework (based on Weka4), including 
all the training set (positive and negative instances) 
as a training corpus. We conduct several 
experiments in order to select the correct classifier, 
the best result being obtained with a model based 
on bagging (using JRip algorithm). Finally, we 
used 10-fold cross validation technique with the 
selected classifier, obtaining a classification value 
of 73.21%.

5 Results and discussion 
EPS task of SemEval-2013 offered many official 
measures to rank the systems. Some of them are 
the following: 
o F-Measure (FM): Correct Response (CR), 
Instances correctly classified, True positives 
(TP), Instances correctly classified as 
positive. False Positives (FP), Instances 
incorrectly classified as positive, True 
Negatives (TN), Instances correctly 
classified as negative, False Negatives (FN), 
Instances incorrectly classified as negative. 
Corpus FM CR TP FP TN FN 
English 0.6892 2826 1198 325 1628 755 
Italian 0.6396 574 245 96 329 180 
Table 2. Official SemEval 2013 results. 
The behavior of our system, for English and 
Italian corpus is shown in Table 2. 
The only thing that changes to process the 
Italian corpus is that Freeling is used as input to 
identify Italian words and it returns the English 
WN synsets. The process continues in the same 
way as English. 
Figure 3: Semantic Distance distribution between 
negative and positive instances.  
As shown in Table 2, our main drawback is to 
classify positive instances. Sometimes, the distance 
between positive phrases is very far. This is due to 
the relations found in the minimum path are very 
similar to the one found in other pairs of negatives 
instances; this can be the cause of our MLS 
classifies them as negatives (see Figure 3). 
Figure 3 shows a distributional graphics that 
take a sample of 200 negative and positive 
instances. The graphics illustrate how close to zero 
value the positive instances are, while the 
negatives are far away from this value. However, 
in the approximate range between 80 and 200, we 
can see values of positive and negative instances 
positioning together. This can be the cause that our 
MLS misclassified some positive instances as 
negative. 
6 Conclusion and future work 
This paper introduced a new framework for EPS, 
which depends on the extraction of several features 
from WordNet relations. We have conducted the 
semantic features extraction in a multidimensional 
context using the resource ISR-WN(Guti?rrez et 
al., 2010a). 
Our semantic distance provides an appealing 
approach for dealing with phrasal detection based 
on WordNet relation. Our team reached the sixth 
position of ten runs for English corpus, with a 
small difference of 0.07 points compared to the 
best results with respect to accuracy parameter. 
Despite the problems caused by poorly selected 
positive instances, our distance (labeled as Our) 
obtained very similar results to those obtained by 
the best team (labeled as First5), which indicates 
that our work is well underway (see Table 3 for 
details). 
Team accuracy recall precision

Our 0.723502 0.613415 0.786605384 
Table 3. Comparative results (English corpus). 
It is important to remark that our system has 
been the only competitor to evaluate Italian texts. 
It has been possible due to our system include 
Freeling in the preprocessing stage. 
Our future work will aim to resolve instances 
misclassified by our algorithm. In addition, we will 
introduce lexical substitutions (synonyms) to 
expand the corpus, we will also apply conceptual 
semantic similarity using relevant semantic trees 
(Guti?rrez et al, 2010b; Guti?rrez et al, 2011b).

Abstract 
This work introduces a new unsupervised 
approach to multilingual word sense 
disambiguation. Its main purpose is to 
automatically choose the intended sense 
(meaning) of a word in a particular context for 
different languages. It does so by selecting the 
correct Babel synset for the word and the 
various Wiki Page titles that mention the 
word. BabelNet contains all the output 
information that our system needs, in its Babel 
synset. Through Babel synset, we find all the 
possible Synsets for the word in WordNet. 
Using these Synsets, we apply the 
disambiguation method Ppr+Freq to find what 
we need. To facilitate the work with WordNet, 
we use the ISR-WN which offers the 
integration of different resources to WordNet. 
Our system, recognized as the best in the 
competition, obtains results around 69% of 
Recall. 
1 Introduction 
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) focuses on 
resolving the semantic ambiguity of a given word.  
This is an important task in Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) because in many applications, 
such as Automatic Translation, it is essential to 
know the exact meaning of a word in a given 
context. In order to solve semantic ambiguity, 
different systems have been developed. However, 
we can categorize them in two main groups: 
supervised and unsupervised systems. The 
supervised ones need large quantity of hand-tagged 
data in order to gather enough information to build 
rules, train systems, and so on. Unsupervised 
systems, on the other hand, do not need such a 
large amount of hand-tagged datasets. This means 
that, when there aren?t enough corpora to train the 
systems, an unsupervised system is a good option. 
A sub-task of WSD is Multilingual Word Sense 
Disambiguation (MWSD) (Navigli et al, 2013) 
that aims at resolving ambiguities in different 
languages. 
In a language, there are words that have only one 
sense (or meaning), but in other languages, the 
same words can have different senses. For 
example, ?patient? is a word that in English can be 
either a noun or an adjective, but in German, it 
only has one sense - ?viz? (a person that needs 
treatment). This shows that the information 
obtained by combining two languages can be more 
useful for WSD because the word senses in each 
language can complement each other. For it to be 
useful, MWSD needs a multilingual resource that 
contains different languages, such as BabelNet 
(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010; 2012) and 
EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998). 
241
As the preferred disambiguation method, we 
decided to use the Ppr+Freq (Personalized Page 
Rank combined with Frequencies of senses)  
(Guti?rrez, 2012) method because, among 
unsupervised systems, graph-based methods have 
obtained more promising results.  
It is worth mentioning the relevant approaches 
used by the scientific community to achieve 
promising results. One approach used is structural 
interconnections, such as Structural Semantic 
Interconnections (SSI), which create structural 
specifications of the possible senses for each word 
in a context (Navigli and Velardi, 2005). The other 
approaches used are ?Exploring the integration of 
WordNet? (Miller et al, 1990), FrameNet (Laparra 
et al, 2010) and those using Page-Rank such as 
(Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007) and (Agirre and Soroa, 
2009). 
The aforementioned types of graph based 
approaches have achieved relevant results in both 
the SensEval-2 and SensEval-3 competitions (see 
Table 1).

Table 1. Relevant WSD approaches. Recall measure is 
calculated recalls using SensEval-2 (English All Word 
task) guidelines over. 
Experiments using SensEval-2 and SensEval-3 
corpora suggest that Ppr+Freq (Guti?rrez, 2012) 
can lead to better results by obtaining over 64% of 
Recall. Therefore we selected Ppr+Freq as the 
WSD method for our system. 
The key proposal for this work is an 
unsupervised algorithm for MWSD, which uses an 
unsupervised method, Ppr+Freq, for semantic 
disambiguation with resources like BabelNet (as 
sense inventory only) (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010) 
and ISR-WN (as knowledge base) (Guti?rrez et al, 
2011a; 2010a). 
ISR-WN was selected as the default knowledge 
base because of previous NLP research, which 
included: (Fern?ndez et al, 2012; Guti?rrez et al, 
2010b; Guti?rrez et al, 2012; 2011b; 2011c; 
2011d), which achieved relevant results using ISR-
WN as their knowledge base. 
2 System architecture  
By using one of BabelNet (BN) features, our 
technique begins by looking for all the Babel 
synsets (Bs) linked to the lemma of each word in 
the sentence that we need to disambiguate.  
Through the Bs offsets, we can get its 
corresponding WordNet Synset (WNS), which 
would be retrieved from WordNet (WN) using the 
ISR-WN resource. As a result, for each lemma, we 
have a WordNet Synset List (WNSL) from which 
our Word Sense Disambiguation method obtains 
one WNS as the correct meaning. 
Our WSD method consists of applying a 
modification of the Personalizing PageRank (Ppr) 
algorithm (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), which 
involves the senses frequency. More specifically, 
the key proposal is known as Ppr+Freq (see 
Section 2.3).  
Given a set of WNSLs of WNSL, as words 
window, we applied the Synsets ranking method, 
Ppr+Freq, which ranks in a descending order, the 
Synsets of each lemma according to a calculated 
factor of relevance. The first Synset (WNS) of 
each WNSL (the most relevant) is established as 
the correct one and its associated Babel synset (Bs) 
is also tagged as correct. To determine the Wiki 
Page Titles (WK), we examine the WIKI 
(Wikipedia pages) and WIKIRED (Wikipedia 
pages redirections) in the correct Babel synset 
obtained. 
Figure 1 shows a general description of our 
system that is made up of the following steps: 
I. Obtaining lemmas  
II. Obtaing WN Synset of selected lemmas  
III. Applying Ppr+Freq method  
IV. Assigning Synset, Babel synset and Wiki 
page title 
Note that ISR-WN contains WN as its nucleus. 
This allows linking both resources, BabelNet and 
ISR-WN.
242
 
Figure 1. General process description taking as instance a sentence provided by the trial dataset. 
 
2.1 Obtaining lemmas  
For each input sentence, we extract the labeled 
lemmas. As an example, for the sentence, ?The 
struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be 
a near thing,? the selected lemmas are: ?struggle,? 
?drug_lord,? ?Colombia?, and ?near_thing.? 
 
Figure 2. Obtaining synset of lemmas. 
 
2.2 Obtaing WN Synset of selected lemmas  
For each lemma obtained in the previous section, 
we look through BabelNet to recover the Bs that 
contains the lemma among its labels. When BSs 
are mapped to WN, we use the ISR-WN resource 
to find the corresponding Synset. Since a lemma 
can appear in a different Bs, it can be mapped with 
several WNS. Thus, we get a Synset list for each 
lemma in the sentence. In case the lemma does not 
have an associated Bs, its list would be empty. An 
example of this step is shown on Figure 2. 
2.3 Applying Ppr+Freq method 
In the above case, Ppr+Freq modifies the ?classic? 
Page Rank approach instead of assigning the same 
weight for each sense of WN in the disambiguation 
graph (??).

Sentence lemmas 
Babel synset 
WordNet synset 
243
and Soroa, 2009) in Word Sense Disambiguation 
thematic, and which has obtained relevant results, 
was an inspiration to us in our work. The main idea 
behind this algorithm is that, for each edge 
between ?i and ?j in graph ?, a vote is made from 
?i to ?j. As a result, the relevance of ?j is 
increased. 
On top of that, the vote strength from ? to ? 
depends on ???? relevance. The philosophy behind 
it is that, the more important the vertex is, the more 
strength the voter would have. Thus, PageRank is 
generated by applying a random walkthrough from 
the internal interconnection of ?, where the final 
relevance of ??  represents the random walkthrough 
probability over ?, and ending on ??. 
Ppr+Freq includes the existent semantic and 
frequency patterns of each sense of the word to 
disambiguate while finding a way to connect each 
one of these words in a knowledge base. 
The new graph-based approach of WSD 
generates a graph of disambiguated words for each 
input sentence. For that reason, it is necessary to 
classify the word senses according to the other 
words that compose the context. The general 
method is shown in Figure 3. This method is 
divided into three steps: 
I. Creation of a disambiguation graph 
II. Application of Ppr+Freq in the generated 
graph 
III. Selection of the correct answer 
Creation of a disambiguation graph: In the first 
step, a disambiguation graph is built by means of a 
Breath First Search (BFS) over the ?super? graph 
composed by all the resources integrated into ISR-
WN. The components involved in this process are: 
WordNet, SUMO (Zouaq et al, 2009) WordNet 
Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) WordNet 
Affects (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) Semantic 
Classes (Izquierdo et al, 2007) and eXtended 
WordNet (XWN) relations (Moldovan and Rus, 
2001). This search aims to recover all senses 
(nodes), domain labels (from WordNet Domain 
and WordNet Affects), SUMO categories, and 
Semantic Classes labels through the shortest path 
between every pair of senses in the WNSL set 
associated with the input sentence. Using ISR-WN 
as the KB, through experimentation, we obtained 
the shortest paths with a length of five edges. For a 
better understanding of this process, see (Guti?rrez, 
2012). 
Application of Ppr+Freq in the generated 
graph: In the second step, we use the weighted 
Personalized PageRank. Here, all the vertices from 
vector ? in ?? are initialized with the value  
1
?
 ; 
where ? is the number of nodes in ??. On the 
other hand, the vertices that represent word senses 
in the analyzed sentence are not initialized with 
this value. Instead, they are initialized with values 
in the range [0?1], which are associated to their 
occurrence frequency in SemCor1 (Corpus and 
sense frequencies knowledge). In the last step, 
after applying the Ppr+Freq algorithm over ??, we 
get a representative vector which contains ISR-WN 
nodes in ?? sorted in a descending order by a 
ranking score computed by this algorithm. For a 
better description, see (Guti?rrez, 2012). 
Selection of the correct answer: As the correct 
sense, we take the highest ranked sense of each 
target word involved in this vector. Note that 
domain labels, SUMO categories, semantic class 
labels, and affect labels are ranked too. They could 
be used in the future to determine relevant 
conceptualizations that would be useful for text 
classification and more. 
In our system, we assume the following 
configuration: dumping factor ? = 0.85 and like in 
(Agirre and Soroa, 2009) we used 30 iterations. A 
detailed explanation about PageRank algorithm 
can be found in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009). 
Table 2 shows an example that analyzes the 
Synset for each word in the sentence and also 
shows how the higher ranked Synsets of the target 
words are selected as the correct ones. For a 
detailed explanation of Ppr+Freq, see (Guti?rrez, 
2012). 
2.4 Assigning Synset, Babel synset and Wiki 
Pages 
In this step, English is handled differently from 
other languages because WordNet Synsets are 
available only for English. The following sections 
explain how we proceed in each case. Once the 
Synsets list is obtained for each lemma in section 
2.3, selecting the correct answer for the lemma is 
all that?s left to do.

Figure 3. General process of WSD with Ppr+Freq. 
2.4.1 English 
Given a lemma, we go through its Synset list from 
beginning to end looking for the first Synset that 
contains a key2 for the lemma. If such Synset 
exists, it is designated as the Synset for the lemma. 
Otherwise, no Synset is assigned. 
As already explained, each Synset in the list is 
connected to a Bs. Therefore, the lemma linked 
with the correct WNS selected in the previous step, 
is chosen as the correct lemma. In case no Synsets 
were designated as the correct ones, we take the 
first Bs in BN, which contains the lemma among 
its labels.  
To determine the Wiki pages titles (WK) we 
examine the WIKIRED and WIKI labels in the 
correct Bs selected in the preceding step. This 
search is restricted only to labels corresponding to 
the analyzed language and discriminating upper 
and lower case letters. Table 2 shows some sample 
results of the WSD process.

2.4.2 Other languages  
For this scenario, we introduce a change in the first 
step discussed in the previous section. The reason 
is that the Synsets do not contain any keys in any 
other language than English. Thus, the correct 
Synset for the lemma is the first in the Synset list 
for the lemma obtained, as described, in section 
2.3. 
3 Results 
We tested three versions (runs) of the proposed 
approach and evaluated them through a trial 
dataset provided by Task123 of Semeval-2013 
using babelnet-1.0.1. Table 3 shows the result for 
each run. Note that the table results were 
calculated with the traditional WSD recall 
measure, being this measure which has ranked 
WSD systems on mostly Semeval competitions. 
On the other hand, note that our precision and 
recall results are different because the coverage is 
not 100%. See Table 5.

than Run1 in the WK with a 78% in English and 
Bs with 60% in French. The best results are in the 
WK in French with a value of 85%. 
Since we can choose to include different 
resources into ISR-WN, it is important to analyze 
how doing so would affect the results. Table 4 
shows comparative results for Run 2 of a trial 
dataset with BabelNet version 1.1.1. 
As can be observed in Table 4, the result does not 
have a significant change even though we used the 
ISR-WN with all resources.  
A better analysis of Ppr+Freq in, as it relates to 
the influence of each resource involved in ISR-WN 
(similar to Table 4 description) assessing 
SensEval-2 and SensEval-3 dataset, is shown in 
(Guti?rrez, 2012). There are different resource 
combinations showing that only XWN1.7 and all 
ISR-WN resources obtain the highest performance. 
Other analysis found in (Guti?rrez, 2012) evaluates 
the influence of adding the sense frequency for 
Ppr+Freq.  
By excluding the Factotum Domain, we obtain 
the best result in Bs 54% for French (only 1% 
more than the version used in the competition). 
The other results are equal, with a 69% in WNS, 
66% in Bs, 64% in WK for English, and 69% in 
WK for French.

3.1 Run1 
In this Run, WNSLs consist of all the target words 
involved in each sentence. This run is applied at 
the sentence level. The results for the competition 
are shown in Table 5. For this Run, the best result 
was obtained for Spanish with a 70.3% in Bs and 
49.3% in WK of Recall. As we can see, for Run1 
the precision is high for Wikipedia disambiguation, 
obtaining for French the best result of the ranking. The 
low Recall in Wikipedia is due to the exact mismatching 
of labels between our system output and the gold 
standard. This fact, affects the rest of our runs. 
3.2 Run2 
In this Run, WNSLs consist of all the target words 
involved in each domain. We can obtain the target 
words because the training and test dataset contain 
the sentences grouped by topics.  For instance, for 
English, 13 WNSLs are established. This Run is 
applied at the corpora level. The results for the 
competition are shown in Table 5. It is important to 
emphasize that our best results ranked our 
algorithm as first place among all proposed 
approaches for the MWSD task. 
For this run, the best Recall was obtained for 
Spanish with a 70.8% in Bs and 50.2% in WK. 
This Run also has the best result of the three runs. 
For the English competition, it ended up with a 
64.5% in WNS, 68.5% in Bs, and 48.7% in WK. 
This Run obtained promising results, which took 
first place in the competition. It also had better 
results than that of the First Sense (Most Frequent 
Sense) baseline in Bs results for all languages, 
except for German. In Bs, it only obtained lower 
results in German with a 62% of Recall for our 
system and 67.3% for the First Sense baseline. 
3.3 Run3 
In this run, WNSLs consist of all the words 
included in each sentence. This run uses target 
words and non-target words of each sentence, as 
they are applied to the sentence level. The results 
for the competition are shown in Table 5.  
As we can see, the behavior of this run is similar 
to the previous runs. 
4 Conclusions and Future work  
The above results suggest that our proposal is a 
promising approach. It is also important to notice 
that a richer knowledgebase can be built by 
combining different resources such as BabelNet 
and ISR-WN, which can lead to an improvement 
of the results. Notwithstanding, our system has 
been recognized as the best in the competition, 
obtaining results around 70% of Recall. 
According to the Task12 results4, only the 
baseline Most Frequent Sense (MFS) could 
improve our scores in order to achieve better WK 
and German (DE) disambiguation. Therefore, we 
plan to review this point to figure out why we 
obtained better results in other categories, but not 
for this one. At the same time, further work will 
use the internal Babel network to run the Ppr+Freq 
method in an attempt to find a way to enrich the 
semantic network obtained for each target sentence 
to disambiguate. On top of that, we plan to 
compare Ppr (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) with 
Ppr+Freq using the Task12 dataset.

Abstract 
In this paper, we describe the development 
and performance of the supervised system 
UMCC_DLSI-(SA). This system uses corpora 
where phrases are annotated as Positive, 
Negative, Objective, and Neutral, to achieve 
new sentiment resources involving word 
dictionaries with their associated polarity. As 
a result, new sentiment inventories are 
obtained and applied in conjunction with 
detected informal patterns, to tackle the 
challenges posted in Task 2b of the Semeval-
2013 competition. Assessing the effectiveness 
of our application in sentiment classification, 
we obtained a 69% F-Measure for neutral and 
an average of 43% F-Measure for positive 
and negative using Tweets and SMS 
messages. 
1 Introduction 
Textual information has become one of the most 
important sources of data to extract useful and 
heterogeneous knowledge from. Texts can provide 
factual information, such as: descriptions, lists of 
characteristics, or even instructions to opinion-
based information, which would include reviews, 
emotions, or feelings. These facts have motivated 
dealing with the identification and extraction of 
opinions and sentiments in texts that require 
special attention.  
Many researchers, such as (Balahur et al, 2010; 
Hatzivassiloglou et al, 2000; Kim and Hovy, 
2006; Wiebe et al, 2005) and many others have 
been working on this and related areas. 
Related to assessment Sentiment Analysis (SA) 
systems, some international competitions have 
taken place. Some of those include: Semeval-2010 
(Task 18: Disambiguating Sentiment Ambiguous 
Adjectives 1 ) NTCIR (Multilingual Opinion 
Analysis Task (MOAT 2)) TASS 3  (Workshop on 
Sentiment Analysis at SEPLN workshop) and 
Semeval-2013 (Task 2 4  Sentiment Analysis in 
Twitter) (Kozareva et al, 2013). 
In this paper, we introduce a system for Task 2 
b) of the Semeval-2013 competition. 
1.1 Task 2 Description 
In participating in ?Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in 
Twitter? of Semeval-2013, the goal was to take a 
given message and its topic and classify whether it 
had a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment 
towards the topic. For messages conveying, both a 
positive and negative sentiment toward the topic, 
the stronger sentiment of the two would end up as 
the classification. Task 2 included two sub-tasks. 
Our team focused on Task 2 b), which provides 
two training corpora as described in Table 3, and 
two test corpora: 1) sms-test-input-B.tsv (with 
2094 SMS) and 2) twitter-test-input-B.tsv (with 
3813 Twit messages). 
The following section shows some background 
approaches. Subsequently, in section 3, we 
describe the UMCC_DLSI-(SA) system that was 
used in Task 2 b). Section 4 describes the 
assessment of the obtained resource from the 
Sentiment Classification task. Finally, the 
conclusion and future works are presented in 
section 5. 
2 Background 
The use of sentiment resources has proven to be a 
necessary step for training and evaluating  systems 
that implement sentiment analysis, which also

include fine-grained opinion mining (Balahur, 
2011). 
In order to build sentiment resources, several 
studies have been conducted. One of the first is the 
relevant work by (Hu and Liu, 2004) using lexicon 
expansion techniques by adding synonymy and 
antonym relations provided by WordNet 
(Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al, 1990) Another one 
is the research described by (Hu and Liu, 2004; 
Liu et al, 2005) which obtained an Opinion 
Lexicon compounded by a list of positive and 
negative opinion words or sentiment words for 
English (around 6800 words). 
A similar approach has been used for building 
WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) 
which expands six basic categories of emotion; 
thus, increasing the lexicon paths in WordNet. 
Nowadays, many sentiment and opinion 
messages are provided by Social Media. To deal 
with the informalities presented in these sources, it 
is necessary to have intermediary systems that 
improve the level of understanding of the 
messages. The following section offers a 
description of this phenomenon and a tool to track 
it. 
2.1 Text normalization 
Several informal features are present in opinions 
extracted from Social Media texts. Some research 
has been conducted in the field of lexical 
normalization for this kind of text. TENOR 
(Mosquera and Moreda, 2012) is a multilingual 
text normalization tool for Web 2.0 texts with an 
aim to transform noisy and informal words into 
their canonical form. That way, they can be easily 
processed by NLP tools and applications. TENOR 
works by identifying out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
words such as slang, informal lexical variants, 
expressive lengthening, or contractions using a 
dictionary lookup and replacing them by matching 
formal candidates in a word lattice using phonetic 
and lexical edit distances. 
2.2 Construction of our own Sentiment 
Resource  
Having analyzed the examples of SA described in 
section 2, we proposed building our own sentiment 
resource (Guti?rrez et al, 2013) by adding lexical 
and informal patterns to obtain classifiers that can 
deal with Task 2b of Semeval-2013. We proposed 
the use of a method named RA-SR (using Ranking 
Algorithms to build Sentiment Resources) 
(Guti?rrez et al, 2013) to build sentiment word 
inventories based on senti-semantic evidence 
obtained after exploring text with annotated 
sentiment polarity information. Through this 
process, a graph-based algorithm is used to obtain 
auto-balanced values that characterize sentiment 
polarities, a well-known technique in Sentiment 
Analysis. This method consists of three key stages: 
(I) Building contextual word graphs; (II) Applying 
a ranking algorithm; and (III) Adjusting the 
sentiment polarity values. 
These stages are shown in the diagram in Figure 1, 
which the development of sentimental resources 
starts off by giving four corpora of annotated 
sentences (the first with neutral sentences, the 
second with objective sentences, the third with 
positive sentences, and the last with negative 
sentences). 
 
 
Figure 1. Resource walkthrough development 
process. 
2.3 Building contextual word graphs 
Initially, text preprocessing is performed by 
applying a Post-Tagging tool (using Freeling 
(Atserias et al, 2006) tool version 2.2 in this case) 
to convert all words to lemmas 5 . After that, all 
obtained lists of lemmas are sent to RA-SR, then 
divided into four groups: neutral, objective, 
positive, and negative candidates. As the first set 
                                                 
5 Lemma denotes canonic form of the words.

of results, four contextual graphs are 
obtained:  ????,   ???? , ????,  and ???? , where 
each graph includes the words/lemmas from the 
neutral, objective, positive and negative sentences 
respectively. These graphs are generated after 
connecting all words for each sentence into 
individual sets of annotated sentences in 
concordance with their annotations (??? , ??? , 
???, ??? ). 
Once the four graphs representing neutral, 
objective, positive and negative contexts are 
created, we proceed to assign weights to apply 
graph-based ranking techniques in order to auto-
balance the particular importance of each vertex ?? 
into ????, ????, ???? and ????. 
As the primary output of the graph-based ranking 
process, the positive, negative, neutral, and 
objective values are calculated using the PageRank 
algorithm and normalized with equation (1). For a 
better understanding of how the contextual graph 
was built see (Guti?rrez et al, 2013). 
2.4 Applying a ranking algorithm 
To apply a graph-based ranking process, it is 
necessary to assign weights to the vertices of the 
graph. Words involved into ????, ????, ???? 
and ???? take the default of 1/N as their weight 
to define the weight of ? vector, which is used in 
our proposed ranking algorithm. In the case where 
words are identified on the sentiment repositories 
(see Table 4) as positive or negative, in relation to 
their respective graph, a weight value of 1 (in a 
range [0?1] ) is assigned. ?  represents the 
maximum quantity of words in the current graph. 
After that, a graph-based ranking algorithm is 
applied in order to structurally raise the graph 
vertexes? voting power. Once the reinforcement 
values are applied, the proposed ranking algorithm 
is able to increase the significance of the words 
related to these empowered vertices. 
The PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) 
adaptation, which was popularized by (Agirre and 
Soroa, 2009) in Word Sense Disambiguation 
thematic, and which has obtained relevant results, 
was an inspiration to us in our work. The main 
idea behind this algorithm is that, for each edge 
between ?i and ?j in graph ?, a vote is made from 
? i to ? j. As a result, the relevance of ? j is 
increased. 
On top of that, the vote strength from ?  to ? 
depends on ???? relevance. The philosophy behind 
it is that, the more important the vertex is, the 
more strength the voter would have. Thus, 
PageRank is generated by applying a random 
walkthrough from the internal interconnection of 
? , where the final relevance of ??  represents the 
random walkthrough probability over ? , and 
ending on ??.  
In our system, we apply the following 
configuration: dumping factor ? = 0.85 and, like 
in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) we used 30 iterations. 
A detailed explanation about the PageRank 
algorithm can be found in (Agirre and Soroa, 
2009)  
After applying PageRank, in order to obtain 
standardized values for both graphs, we normalize 
the rank values by applying the equation (1), 
where ???(??) obtains the maximum rank value 
of ?? vector (rankings? vector). 
??? = ???/???(??) (1) 
2.5 Adjusting the sentiment polarity values 
After applying the PageRank algorithm on????, 
???? , ????  and ???? , having normalized their 
ranks, we proceed to obtain a final list of lemmas 
(named ?? ) while avoiding repeated elements. 
?? is represented by ???  lemmas, which would 
have, at that time, four assigned values: Neutral, 
Objective, Positive, and Negative, all of which 
correspond to a calculated rank obtained by the 
PageRank algorithm.  
At that point, for each lemma from ??,  the 
following equations are applied in order to select 
the definitive subjectivity polarity for each one: 
??? =  {
??? ? ??? ;  ??? > ???
0                ; ?????????
 (2) 
??? =  {
??? ? ??? ;  ??? > ???
0                ; ?????????
 (3) 
Where ???  is the Positive value and ???  the 
Negative value related to each lemma in ??. 
In order to standardize again the ???  and ??? 
values and making them more representative in a 
[0?1] scale, we proceed to apply a normalization 
process over the ??? and ??? values. 
From there, based on the objective features 
commented by (Baccianella et al, 2010), we 
assume the same premise to establish an 
alternative objective value of the lemmas. 
Equation (4) is used for that: 
?????? = 1 ? |??? ? ???| (4) 
Where ??????  represents the alternative 
objective value. 
445
As a result, each word obtained in the sentiment 
resource has an associated value of: positivity 
(??? , see equation (2)), negativity (??? , see 
equation (3)), objectivity(????_???,  obtained by 
PageRank over ????  and normalized with 
equation (1)), calculated-objectivity (??????, now 
cited as ???_???????? ) and neutrality (??? , 
obtained by PageRank over ???? and normalized 
with equation (1)). 
3  System Description 
The system takes annotated corpora as input from 
which two models are created. One model is 
created by using only the data provided at 
Semeval-2013 (Restricted Corpora, see Table 3), 
and the other by using extra data from other 
annotated corpora (Unrestricted Corpora, see 
Table 3). In all cases, the phrases are pre-
processed using Freeling 2.2 pos-tagger (Atserias 
et al, 2006) while a dataset copy is normalized 
using TENOR (described in section 2.1). 
The system starts by extracting two sets of 
features. The Core Features (see section 3.1) are 
the Sentiment Measures and are calculated for a 
standard and normalized phrase. The Support 
Features (see section 3.2) are based on regularities, 
observed in the training dataset, such as 
emoticons, uppercase words, and so on. 
The supervised models are created using Weka6 
and a Logistic classifier, both of which the system 
uses to predict the values of the test dataset. The 
selection of the classifier was made after analyzing 
several classifiers such as: Support Vector 
Machine, J48 and REPTree. Finally, the Logistic 
classifier proved to be the best by increasing the 
results around three perceptual points. 
The test data is preprocessed in the same way 
the previous corpora were. The same process of 
feature extraction is also applied. With the 
aforementioned features and the generated models, 
the system proceeds to classify the final values of 
Positivity, Negativity, and Neutrality.  
3.1 The Core Features 
The Core Features is a group of measures based on 
the resource created early (see section 2.2). The 
system takes a sentence preprocessed by Freeling 
2.2 and TENOR. For each lemma of the analyzed 
sentence, ??? , ??? , ???_???????? ,  ????_???, 
                                                 
6 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ 
and ???  are calculated by using the respective 
word values assigned in RA-SR. The obtained 
values correspond to the sum of the corresponding 
values for each intersecting word between the 
analyzed sentence (lemmas list) and the obtained 
resource by RA-SR. Lastly, the aforementioned 
attributes are normalized by dividing them by the 
number of words involved in this process. 
Other calculated attributes are: ???_????? , 
???_????? , ???_????????_????? , 
???_????_????? and ???_?????. These attributes 
count each involved iteration for each feature type 
( ??? , ??? , ????_??? , ??????  and ??? 
respectively, where the respective value may be 
greater than zero. 
Attributes ???  and cnn are calculated by 
counting the amount of lemmas in the phrases 
contained in the Sentiment Lexicons (Positive and 
Negative respectively).  
All of the 12 attributes described previously are 
computed for both, the original, and the 
normalized (using TENOR) phrase, totaling 24 
attributes. The Core features are described next.

Table 1. Core Features 
3.2 The Support Features 
The Support Features is a group of measures based 
on characteristics of the phrases, which may help 
with the definition on extreme cases. The emotPos 
and emotNeg values are the amount of Positive 
and Negative Emoticons found in the phrase. The 
exc and itr are the amount of exclamation and 
interrogation signs in the phrase. The following 
table shows the attributes that represent the 
support features:

Table 2. The Support Features 
4 Evaluation 
In the construction of the sentiment resource, we 
used the annotated sentences provided by the 
corpora described in Table 3. The resources listed 
in Table 3 were selected to test the functionality of 
the words annotation proposal with subjectivity 
and objectivity. Note that the shadowed rows 
correspond to constrained runs corpora: tweeti-b-
sub.dist_out.tsv 8  (dist), b1_tweeti-objorneu-
b.dist_out.tsv 9  (objorneu), twitter-dev-input-
B.tsv10 (dev). 
The resources from Table 3 that include 
unconstrained runs corpora are: all the previously 
mentioned ones, Computational-intelligence11 (CI) 
and stno12 corpora. 
The used sentiment lexicons are from the 
WordNetAffect_Categories13 and opinion-words14 
files as shown in detail in Table 4. 
Some issues were taken into account throughout 
this process. For instance, after obtaining a 
contextual graph ?, factotum words are present in 
most of the involved sentences (i.e., verb ?to be?). 
This issue becomes very dangerous after applying 
the PageRank algorithm because the algorithm

strengthens the nodes possessing many linked 
elements. For that reason, the subtractions ??? ?
??? and ??? ? ??? are applied, where the most 
frequent words in all contexts obtain high values. 
The subtraction becomes a dumping factor.  
As an example, when we take the verb ?to be?, 
before applying equation (1), the verb achieves the 
highest values in each subjective context graph 
(????  and ????)  namely, 9.94 and 18.67 rank 
values respectively. These values, once equation 
(1) is applied, are normalized obtaining both 
??? =  1 and ??? =  1 in a range [0...1]. At the 
end, when the following steps are executed 
(Equations (2) and (3)), the verb ?to be? 
achieves ??? = 0 , ??? = 0  and 
therefore  ?????? = 1 . Through this example, it 
seems as though we subjectively discarded words 
that appear frequently in both contexts (Positive 
and Negative).

4.1 The training evaluation 
In order to assess the effectiveness of our trained 
classifiers, we performed some evaluation tests.  
Table 5 shows relevant results obtained after 
applying our system to an environment (specific 
domain). The best results were obtained with the

restricted corpus. The information used to increase 
the knowledge was not balanced or perhaps is of 
poor quality. 
4.2 The test evaluation 
The test dataset evaluation is shown in Table 6, 
where system results are compared with the best 
results in each case. We notice that the constrained 
run is better in almost every aspect. In the few 
cases where it was lower, there was a minimal 
difference. This suggests that the information used 
to increase our Sentiment Resource was 
unbalanced (high difference between quantity of 
tagged types of annotated phrases), or was of poor 
quality. By comparing these results with the ones 
obtained by our system on the test dataset, we 
notice that on the test dataset, the results fell in the 
middle of the effectiveness scores. After seeing 
these results (Table 5 and Table 6), we assumed 
that our system performance is better in a 
controlled environment (or specific domain). To 
make it more realistic, the system must be trained 
with a bigger and more balanced dataset. 
Table 6 shows the results obtained by our 
system while comparing them to the best results of 
Task 2b of Semeval-2013. In Table 5, we can see 
the difference between the best systems. They are 
the ones in bold and underlined as target results.  
These results have a difference of around 20 
percentage points. The grayed out ones correspond 
to our runs.

As we can see in the training and testing 
evaluation tables, our training stage offered more 
relevant scores than the best scores in Task2b 
(Semaval-2013). This means that we need to 
identify the missed features between both datasets 
(training and testing). 
For that reason, we decided to check how many 
words our system (more concretely, our Sentiment 
Resource) missed. Table 7 shows that our system 
missed around 20% of the words present in the test 
dataset.

5 Conclusion and further work 
Based on what we have presented, we can say that 
we could develop a system that would be able to 
solve the SA challenge with promising results. The 
presented system has demonstrated election 
performance on a specific domain (see Table 5) 
with results over 80%. Also, note that our system, 
through the SA process, automatically builds 
sentiment resources from annotated corpora.  
For future research, we plan to evaluate RA-SR 
on different corpora. On top of that, we also plan 
to deal with the number of neutral instances and 
finding more words to evaluate the obtained 
sentiment resource.

Abstract 
In this paper we describe UMCC_DLSI-
(DDI) system which attempts to detect and 
classify drug entities in biomedical texts. 
We discuss the use of semantic class and 
words relevant domain, extracted with ISR-
WN (Integration of Semantic Resources 
based on WordNet) resource to obtain our 
goal. Following this approach our system 
obtained an F-Measure of 27.5% in the 
DDIExtraction 2013 (SemEval 2013 task 
9). 
1. Introduction 
To understand biological processes, we must 
clarify how some substances interact with our 
body and one to each other. One of these 
important relations is the drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs). They occur when one drug interacts 
with another or when it affects the level, or 
activity of another drug. DDIs can change the 
way medications act in the body, they can cause 
powerful, dangerous and unexpected side 
effects, and also they can make the medications 
less effective. 
As suggested by (Segura-Bedmar et al, 2011), 
?...the detection of DDI is an important research 
area in patient safety since these interactions 
can become very dangerous and increase health 
care costs?. More recent studies (Percha and 
Altman, 2013) reports that ??Recent estimates 
indicate that DDIs cause nearly 74000 
emergency room visits and 195000 
hospitalizations each year in the USA?.  
But, on the other hand, there is an expansion in 
the volume of published biomedical research, 
and therefore the underlying biomedical 
knowledge base (Cohen and Hersh, 2005). 
Unfortunately, as often happens, this 
information is unstructured or in the best case 
scenario semi-structured. 
As we can see in (Tari et al, 2010), ?Clinical 
support tools often provide comprehensive lists 
of DDIs, but they usually lack the supporting 
scientific evidences and different tools can 
return inconsistent results?.  
Although, as mentioned (Segura-Bedmar et al, 
2011) ?there are different databases supporting 
healthcare professionals in the detection of DDI, 
these databases are rarely complete, since their 
update periods can reach up to three years?. In 
addition to these and other difficulties, the great 
amount of drug interactions are frequently 
reported in journals of clinical pharmacology 
and technical reports, due to this fact, medical 
literature becomes most effective source for 
detection of DDI. Thereby, the management of 
DDI is a critical issue due to the overwhelming 
amount of information available on them 
(Segura-Bedmar et al, 2011).

1.1. Task Description 
With the aim of reducing the time the health care 
professionals invest on reviewing the literature, 
we present a feature-based system for drug 
detection and classification in biomedical texts. 
The DDIExtraction2013 task was divided into 
two subtasks: Recognition and classification of 
drug names (Task 9.1) and Extraction of drug-
drug interactions (Task 9.2). Our system was 
developed to be presented in the Task 9.1. In this 
case, participants were to detect and classify the 
drugs that were present in the test data set which 
was a set of sentences related to the biomedical 
domain obtained from a segmented corpus. The 
output consisted of a list mentioning all the 
detected drugs with information concerning the 
sentence it was detected from as well as its 
offset in that sentence (the position of the first 
and the last character of the drug in the sentence, 
0 being the first character of a sentence). Also 
the type of the drug should have been provided. 
As to the type, participants had to classify 
entities in one of these four groups1: 
? Drug: any chemical agent used for 
treatment, cure, prevention or diagnose of 
diseases, which have been approved for 
human usage. 
? Brand: any drug which firstly have been 
developed by a pharmaceutical company. 
? Group: any term in the text designating a 
relation among pharmaceutical substances. 
? No-Human: any chemical agent which 
affects the human organism. An active 
substance non-approved for human usage 
as medication. 
In the next section of the paper, we present 
related works (Section 2). In Section 3, we 
discuss the feature-based system we propose. 
Evaluation results are discussed in Section 4. 
Finally, we conclude and propose future work 
(Section 5). 
2. Related Work 
One of the most important workshops on the 
domain of Bioinformatics has been BioCreAtIve 
(Critical Assessment of Information Extraction 
                                                     
1 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task9 
in Biology) (Hirschman et al, 2005). This 
workshop has improved greatly the Information 
Extraction techniques applied to the biological 
domain. The goal of the first BioCreAtIvE 
challenge was to provide a set of common 
evaluation tasks to assess the state-of-the-art for 
text mining applied to biological problems. The 
workshop was held in Granada, Spain on March 
28-31, 2004. 
According to Hirschman, the first 
BioCreAtIvE assessment achieved a high level 
of international participation (27 groups from 10 
countries). The best system results for a basic 
task (gene name finding and normalization), 
where a balanced 80% precision/recall or better, 
which potentially makes them suitable for real 
applications in biology. The results for the 
advanced task (functional annotation from free 
text) were significantly lower, demonstrating the 
current limitations of text-mining approaches. 
The greatest contribution of BioCreAtIve was 
the creation and release of training and test data 
sets for both tasks (Hirschman et al, 2005). 
One of the seminal works where the issue of 
drug detection was mentioned was (Gr?nroos et 
al., 1995). Authors argue the problem can be 
solved by using a computerized information 
system, which includes medication data of 
individual patients as well as information about 
non-therapeutic drug-effects. Also, they suggest 
a computerized information system to build 
decision support modules that, automatically 
give alarms or alerts of important drug effects 
other than therapeutic effects. If these warnings 
concern laboratory tests, they would be checked 
by a laboratory physician and only those with 
clinical significance would be sent to clinicians. 
Here, it is important to note the appearance of 
the knowledgebase DrugBank 2 . Since its first 
release in 2006 (Wishart et al, 2008) it has been 
widely used to facilitate in silico drug target 
discovery, drug design, drug docking or 
screening, drug metabolism prediction, drug 
interaction prediction and general 
pharmaceutical education. DrugBank has also 
significantly improved the power and simplicity 
of its structure query and text query searches.

637
Later on, in 2010 Tari propose an approach 
that integrates text mining and automated 
reasoning to derive DDIs (Tari et al, 2010). 
Through the extraction of various facts of drug 
metabolism, they extract, not only the explicitly 
DDIs mentioned in text, but also the potential 
interactions that can be inferred by reasoning. 
This approach was able to find several potential 
DDIs that are not present in DrugBank. This 
analysis revealed that 81.3% of these 
interactions are determined to be correct. 
On the DDIExtraction 2011 (Segura-Bedmar et 
al., 2011) workshop (First Challenge Task on 
Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction) the best 
performance was achieved by the team WBI 
from Humboldt-Universitat, Berlin. This team 
combined several kernels and a case-based 
reasoning (CBR) system, using a voting 
approach. 
In this workshop relation extraction was 
frequently and successfully addressed by 
machine learning methods. Some of the more 
common used features were co-occurrences, 
character n-grams, Maximal Frequent 
Sequences, bag-of-words, keywords, etc. 
Another used technique is distant supervision. 
The first system evaluating distant supervision 
for drug-drug interaction was presented in 
(Bobi? et al, 2012), they have proposed a 
constraint to increase the quality of data used for 
training based on the assumption that no self-
interaction of real-world objects are described in 
sentences. In addition, they merge information 
from IntAct and the University of Kansas 
Proteomics Service (KUPS) database in order to 
detect frequent exceptions from the distant 
supervision assumption and make use of more 
data sources. 
Another important work related to Biomedical 
Natural Language Processing was BioNLP 
(Bj?rne et al, 2011) it is an application of 
natural language processing methods to analyze 
textual data on biology and medicine, often 
research articles. They argue that information 
extraction techniques can be used to mine large 
text datasets for relevant information, such as 
relations between specific types of entities. 
Inspired in the previews works the system we 
propose makes use of machine learning methods 
too, using some of the common features 
described above, such as the n-grams and 
keywords and co-occurrences, but we also add 
some semantic information to enrich those 
features. 
3. System Description  
As it has been mentioned before, the system was 
developed to detect and classify drugs in 
biomedical texts, so the process is performed in 
two main phases:  
? drug detection. 
? drug classification. 
Both phases are determined by the following 
stages, described in Figure 1: 
I. Preprocessing 
II. Feature extraction 
III. Classification

of the sentence, by means of Freeling tool 3 . 
After that, it is able to generate candidates 
according to certain parameters (see section 3.3). 
Then, all the generated candidates are 
processed to extract the features needed for the 
learning methods, in order to determine which 
candidates are drugs. 
After the drugs are detected, the system 
generates a tagged corpus, following the 
provided training corpus structure, containing 
the detected entities, and then it proceeds to 
classify each one of them. To do so, another 
supervised learning algorithm was used (see 
section 3.3). 
3.1. Candidates generation 
Drugs and drug groups, as every entity in 
Natural Language, follow certain grammatical 
patterns. For instance, a drug is usually a noun 
or a set of nouns, or even a combination of verbs 
and nouns, especially verbs in the past participle 
tense and gerunds. But, one thing we noticed is 
that both drugs and drug groups end with a noun 
and as to drug groups that noun is often in the 
plural. 
Based on that idea, we decided to generate 
candidates starting from the end of each 
sentence and going forward. 
Generation starts with the search of a pivot 
word, which in this case is a noun. When the 
pivot is found, it is added to the candidates list, 
and then the algorithm takes the word before the 
pivot to see if it complies with one of the 
patterns i.e. if the word is a noun, an adjective, a 
gerund or past participle verb. If it does, then it 
and the pivot form another candidate.  
After that, the algorithm continues until it finds 
a word that does not comply with a pattern. In 
this case, it goes to the next pivot and stops 
when all the nouns in the sentence have been 
processed, or the first word of the sentence is 
reached. 
3.2. Feature Description 
For the DDIExtraction20134 task 9 three runs of 
the same system were performed with different 
                                                     
3 http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/ 
features each time. The next sections describes 
the features we used. 
3.2.1. Most Frequent Semantic Classes 
(MFSC) 
Given a word, its semantic class label (Izquierdo 
et al, 2007) is obtained from WordNet using the 
ISR-WN resource (Guti?rrez et al, 2011; 2010). 
The semantic class is that associated to the most 
probable sense of the word. For each entity in 
the training set we take the words in the same 
sentence and for each word its semantic class is 
determined. This way, we identify the 4005 most 
frequent semantic classes associated to words 
surrounding the entities in the training set.  
For a candidate entity we use 400 features to 
encode information with regard to whether or 
not in its same sentence a word can be found 
belonging to one of the most frequent semantic 
classes. 
Each one of these features takes a value 
representing the distance (measured in words) a 
candidate is from the nearest word with same 
semantic class which represents the attribute.  
If the word is to the left of the candidate, the 
attribute takes a negative value, if it is to the 
right, the value is positive, and zero if no word 
with that semantic class is present in the 
sentence the candidate belongs to. 
To better understand that, consider A1 is the 
attribute which indicates if in the sentence of the 
candidate a word can be found belonging to the 
semantic class 1. Thus, the value of A1 is the 
distance the candidate is from the closest word 
with semantic class 1 in the sentence that is 
being analyzed. 
3.2.2. Candidate Semantic Class (CSC) 
The semantic class of candidates is also included 
in the feature set, if the candidate is a multi-
word, then the semantic class of the last word 
(the pivot word) is taken.  
 
                                                                               
4 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task9/ 
5 This value was extracted from our previous experiment. 
639
3.2.3. Most Frequent Semantic Classes 
from Entities (EMFSC) 
In order to add more semantic information, we 
decided to find the most frequent semantic 
classes among all the entities that were tagged in 
the training data set. We included, in the feature 
set, all the semantic classes with a frequency of 
eight or more, because all the classes we wanted 
to identify were represented in that threshold. In 
total, they make 29 more features. The values of 
every one of them, is the sum of the number of 
times it appears in the candidate.  
3.2.4. Candidate Semantic Class All 
Words (CSC-All) 
This feature is similar to CSC, but in this case 
the candidate is a multi-word, we not only look 
for the semantic class of the pivot, but also the 
whole candidate as one. 
3.2.5. Drug-related domains (DRD) 
Another group of eight attributes describes how 
many times each one of the candidates belongs 
to one of the following drug-related domains 
(DRD) (medicine, anatomy, biology, chemistry, 
physiology, pharmacy, biochemistry, genetics).  
These domains where extracted from WordNet 
Domains. In order to determine the domain that 
a word belongs to, the proposal of DRelevant 
(V?zquez et al, 2007; V?zquez et al, 2004) was 
used. 
To illustrate how the DRD features take their 
values, consider the following sentence: 
??until the lipid response to Accutane is 
established.? 
One of the candidates the system generates 
would be ?lipid response?. It is a two-word 
candidate, so we take the first word and see if it 
belongs to one of the above domains. If it does, 
then we add one to that feature. If the word does 
not belong to any of the domains, then its value 
will be zero. We do the same with the other 
word. In the end, we have a collection where 
every value corresponds to each one of the 
domains. For the example in question the 
collection would be:  
 
 
medicine 1 
anatomy 0 
biology 0 
chemistry 0 
physiology 1 
pharmacy 0 
biochemistry 0 
genetics 0 
Table 1. DRD value assignment example. 
3.2.6. Candidate word number (WNum) 
Because there are candidates that are a multi-
word and others that are not, it may be the case 
that a candidate, which is a multi-word, has an 
EMFSC bigger than others which are not a 
multi-word, just because more than one of the 
words that conform it, have a frequent semantic 
class.  
We decided to add a feature, called WNum, 
which would help us normalize the values of the 
EMFSC. The value of the feature would be the 
number of words the candidate has. Same thing 
happens with DRD. 
3.2.7. Candidate Domain (CD) 
The value of this nominal feature is the domain 
associated to the candidate. If the candidate is a 
multi-word; we get the domain of all the words 
as a whole. In both cases the domain for a single 
word as well as for a multi-word is determined 
using the relevant domains obtained by 
(V?zquez et al, 2007; V?zquez et al, 2004). 
3.2.8. Maximum Frequent 2-grams, 3-
grams 
Drugs usually contain sequences of characters 
that are very frequent in biomedical domain 
texts. These character sequences are called n-
grams, where n is the number of characters in 
the sequence. Because of that, we decided to add 
the ten most frequent n-grams with n between 
two and three. The selected n-grams are the 
following: ?in? (frequency: 8170), ?ne? (4789), 
?ine? (3485), ?ti? (3234), ?id? (2768), ?an? 
(2704), ?ro? (2688), ?nt? (2593), ?et? (2423), 
?en? (2414). 
These features take a value of one if the 
candidate has the corresponding character 
sequence and zero if it does not. For instance: if 
640
we had the candidate ?panobinostat? it will 
generate the following collection:  
?in? 1 
?ne? 0 
?ine? 0 
?ti? 0 
?id? 0 
?an? 1 
?ro? 0 
?nt? 0 
?et? 0 
?en? 0 
Table 2. MF 2-gram, 3-gram. 
3.2.9. Uppercase (UC), Uppercase All 
(UCA). Multi-word (MWord) and 
Number (N) 
Other features say if the first letter of the 
candidate is an uppercase; if all of the letters are 
uppercase (UCA); if it is a multi-word (MWord) 
and also if it is in the singular or in the plural 
(N).  
3.2.10. L1, L2, L3 and R1, R2, R3 
The Part-of-Speech tags of the closest three 
surrounding words of the candidates are also 
included. We named those features L1, L2, and 
L3 for POS tags to the left of the candidate, and 
R1, R2, and R3 for those to the right. 
3.2.11. POS-tagging combination (GC) 
Different values are assigned to candidates, in 
order to identify its POS-tagging combination. 
For instance: to the following entity ?combined 
oral contraceptives? taken from DDI13-train-
TEES-analyses-130304.xml6 training file, which 
was provided for task 9.1, corresponds 5120. 
This number is the result of combining the four 
grammatical categories that really matter to us: 
R for adverb, V for verb, J for adjective, N for 
noun.  
A unique number was given to each 
combination of those four letters. We named this 
feature  GC. 
 
                                                     
6 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task9 
3.2.12. In resource feature (InRe) 
A resource was created which contains all the 
drug entities that were annotated in the training 
corpus, so another attribute tells the system if the 
candidate is in the resource.  
Since all of the entities in the training data set 
were in the resource this attribute could take a 
value of one for all instances. Thus the classifier 
could classify correctly all instances in the 
training data set just looking to this attribute, 
which is not desirable. To avoid that problem, 
we randomly set its value to zero every 9/10 of 
the training instances. 
3.3. Classification 
All the features extracted in the previous stages 
are used in this stage to obtain the two models, 
one for drug detection phase, and the other for 
drug classification phase.  
We accomplished an extensive set of 
experiments in order to select the best classifier. 
All algorithms implemented in WEKA, except 
those that were designed specifically for a 
regression task, were tried. In each case we 
perform a 10-fold cross-validation. In all 
experiments the classifiers were settled with the 
default configuration. From those tests we select 
a decision tree, the C4.5 algorithm (Guti?rrez et 
al., 2011; 2010) implemented as the J48 
classifier in WEKA.  This classifier yields the 
better results for both drug detection and drug 
classification. 
The classifier was trained using a set of 463 
features, extracted from the corpus provided by 
SemEval 2013, the task 9 in question. 
As it was mentioned before, three runs were 
performed for the competition. Run (1) used the 
following features for drug detection: MFSC 
(only 200 frequent semantic classes), MF 2-
grams, 3-grams, UC, UCA, MWord, N, L1, L2, 
L3, R1, R2, R3, CSC, CD, WNum, GC and 
InRe.  
Drug classification in this run used the same 
features except for CD, WNum, and GC. Run 
(2) has all the above features, but we added the 
remaining 200 sematic classes that we left out in 
Run (1) to the detection and the classification 
models. In Run (3), we added EMFSC feature to 
the detection and the classification models. 
641
4. Results 
In the task, the results of the participants were 
compared to a gold-standard and evaluated 
according to various evaluation criteria:  
? Exact evaluation, which demands not only 
boundary match, but also the type of the 
detected drug has to be the same as that of 
the gold-standard. 
? Exact boundary matching (regardless of 
the type). 
? Partial boundary matching (regardless of 
the type) 
? Type matching. 
Precision and recall were calculated using the 
scoring categories proposed by MUC 7: 
? COR: the output of the system and the 
gold-standard annotation agree. 
? INC: the output of the system and the 
gold-standard annotation disagree. 
? PAR: the output of the system and the 
gold-standard annotation are not identical 
but has some overlapping text. 
? MIS: the number of gold-standard entities 
that were not identify by the system. 
? SPU: the number of entities labeled by the 
system that are not in the gold-standard. 
Table 3 , Table 4 and Table 5 show the system 
results in the DDIExtraction2013 competition 
for Run (1).  
Run (2) and Run (3) results are almost the 
same as Run (1). It is an interesting result since 
in those runs 200 additional features were 
supplied to the classifier.  In feature evaluation, 
using CfsSubsetEval and GeneticSearch with 
WEKA we found that all these new features 
were ranked as worthless for the classification. 
On the other hand, the following features were 
the ones that really influenced the classifiers: 
MFSC (215 features only), MF 2-grams, 3-
grams (?ne?, ?ine?, ?ti?, ?ro?, ?et?, ?en?), 
WNum, UC, UCA, L1, R1, CSC, CSC-All, CD, 
DRD (anatomy, physiology, pharmacy, 
biochemistry), InRe, GC and EMFS, specifically

5. Conclusion and future works 
In this paper we show the description of 
UMCC_DLSI-(DDI) system, which is able to 
detect and classify drugs in biomedical texts 
with acceptable efficacy. It introduces in this 
thematic the use of semantic information such as 
semantic classes and the relevant domain of the 
words, extracted with ISR-WN resource. With 
this approach we obtained an F-Measure of 
27.5% in the Semeval DDI Extraction2013 task 
9.  
As further work we propose to eliminate some 
detected bugs (i.e. repeated instances, 
multiwords missed) and enrich our knowledge 
base (ISR-WN), using biomedical sources as 
UMLS8, SNOMED9 and OntoFis10.
