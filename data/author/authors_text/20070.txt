Introduction
Recent years have seen a rapid growth in the use of biomedical documents and narrative clinical records
for applications outside of direct patient care. Accordingly, recent years have also seen an increase in
the development of NLP technologies for concept and relation extraction, summarization, and question
answering on these data.
This tutorial will present an overview of the biomedical and clinical NLP data, tools, and methods
with the intent of providing the researchers with a jump-start into these domains. We will focus on the
demand for NLP in biomedical and clinical domains, the potential for impact, and the required NLP
tasks. We will introduce this information in the following categories:
Overview of biomedical/clinical NLP
Biomedical narratives are often dense with domain-specific jargon. Clinical narratives, in addition to be-
ing dense with domain-specific jargon, exhibit the complexities of a specialized sub-language. They are
written by the domain experts and for the domain experts. Their primary purpose is to assist in inform-
ing future decisions about the care of the patients. As a result, both biomedical and clinical narratives
present challenges for existing open-domain NLP technologies and require special considerations for
their accurate understanding and interpretation.
In this section, we will discuss the data sources currently available to researchers, as well as provide
an overview of the research questions both domains. On the clinical side, this includes using EHRs
for phenotyping and decision support systems. The biomedical side uses NLP to explore fields such as
literature-based discovery and literature searches.
Current research questions in biomedical and clinical NLP
NLP applications are generally built to answer specific questions about data. In this section, we will pro-
vide examples of the types of questions researchers are asking in the clinical and biomedical domains.
Additionally, we will discuss how different linguistic aspects of these data are addressed by looking at ex-
isting syntactic (part of speech tagging, parsing) and semantic (concept extraction, temporal information
extraction, coreference resolution) systems.
Datasets and the annotation process
Building annotated corpora for any task can be challenging, but the biomedical and clinical domains have
additional barriers that make creating these corpora difficult. In this section, we will discuss available
annotated resources in both domains, and discuss challenges in biomedical and clinical corpus building,
such as restrictions on data access and the need for domain experts to be part of the annotation process.

Clinical Annotation Case Study
The 2014 i2b2 NLP Shared Task
1
involved two NLP challenges: 1) de-identification of medical records,
and 2) identification of risk factors for coronary artery disease in diabetic patients. Each of these tracks
required a separate annotation effort, and in this portion of the tutorial we will describe the end-to-end
process of creating this annotated resource, from data selection to writing the annotation guidelines to
creating the final gold standards.
NLP Methods
Just as there are many research questions in the biomedical and clinical domains, there are many existing
NLP systems that address these questions. In this portion of the tutorial, we will describe the three main
approaches (rule-based, statistical, and hybrid) commonly used to process biomedical and clinical text.
Additionally, we will present on-going research projects from our research labs including (1) extracting
structure and semantics from clinical text through section segmentation and assertion analysis and (2)
clinical applications such as phenotype modeling and specific examples of information extraction in the
radiology domain.
Open questions and future directions
Research in the fields of biomedical and clinical NLP is far from complete; the end of this tutorial will
look at current unsolved problems in these fields, as well as look ahead towards potential future research
questions.
