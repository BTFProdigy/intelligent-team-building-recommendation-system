Abstract
This paper presents a new approach to
phrase-level sentiment analysis that first
determines whether an expression is neu-
tral or polar and then disambiguates the
polarity of the polar expressions. With this
approach, the system is able to automat-
ically identify the contextual polarity for
a large subset of sentiment expressions,
achieving results that are significantly bet-
ter than baseline.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying positive
and negative opinions, emotions, and evaluations.
Most work on sentiment analysis has been done at
the document level, for example distinguishing pos-
itive from negative reviews. However, tasks such
as multi-perspective question answering and sum-
marization, opinion-oriented information extraction,
and mining product reviews require sentence-level
or even phrase-level sentiment analysis. For exam-
ple, if a question answering system is to successfully
answer questions about people?s opinions, it must be
able to pinpoint expressions of positive and negative
sentiments, such as we find in the sentences below:
(1) African observers generally approved+ of his
victory while Western governments denounced?
it.
(2) A succession of officers filled the TV
screen to say they supported+ the people and that
the killings were ?not tolerable?.?
(3) ?We don?t hate+ the sinner,? he says,
?but we hate? the sin.?
A typical approach to sentiment analysis is to start
with a lexicon of positive and negative words and
phrases. In these lexicons, entries are tagged with
their a priori prior polarity: out of context, does
the word seem to evoke something positive or some-
thing negative. For example, beautiful has a positive
prior polarity, and horrid has a negative prior polar-
ity. However, the contextual polarity of the phrase
in which a word appears may be different from the
word?s prior polarity. Consider the underlined polar-
ity words in the sentence below:
(4) Philip Clapp, president of the National Environ-
ment Trust, sums up well the general thrust of the
reaction of environmental movements: ?There is no
reason at all to believe that the polluters are sud-
denly going to become reasonable.?
Of these words, ?Trust,? ?well,? ?reason,? and ?rea-
sonable? have positive prior polarity, but they are
not all being used to express positive sentiments.
The word ?reason? is negated, making the contex-
tual polarity negative. The phrase ?no reason at all
to believe? changes the polarity of the proposition
that follows; because ?reasonable? falls within this
proposition, its contextual polarity becomes nega-
tive. The word ?Trust? is simply part of a referring
expression and is not being used to express a senti-
ment; thus, its contextual polarity is neutral. Simi-
larly for ?polluters?: in the context of the article, it
simply refers to companies that pollute. Only ?well?
has the same prior and contextual polarity.
Many things must be considered in phrase-level
sentiment analysis. Negation may be local (e.g., not
good), or involve longer-distance dependencies such
as the negation of the proposition (e.g., does not
look very good) or the negation of the subject (e.g.,
347
no one thinks that it?s good). In addition, certain
phrases that contain negation words intensify rather
than change polarity (e.g., not only good but amaz-
ing). Contextual polarity may also be influenced by
modality (e.g., whether the proposition is asserted to
be real (realis) or not real (irrealis) ? no reason at all
to believe is irrealis, for example); word sense (e.g.,
Environmental Trust versus He has won the peo-
ple?s trust); the syntactic role of a word in the sen-
tence (e.g., polluters are versus they are polluters);
and diminishers such as little (e.g., little truth, lit-
tle threat). (See (Polanya and Zaenen, 2004) for a
more detailed discussion of contextual polarity in-
fluencers.)
This paper presents new experiments in automat-
ically distinguishing prior and contextual polarity.
Beginning with a large stable of clues marked with
prior polarity, we identify the contextual polarity of
the phrases that contain instances of those clues in
the corpus. We use a two-step process that employs
machine learning and a variety of features. The
first step classifies each phrase containing a clue as
neutral or polar. The second step takes all phrases
marked in step one as polar and disambiguates their
contextual polarity (positive, negative, both, or neu-
tral). With this approach, the system is able to auto-
matically identify the contextual polarity for a large
subset of sentiment expressions, achieving results
that are significantly better than baseline. In addi-
tion, we describe new manual annotations of contex-
tual polarity and a successful inter-annotator agree-
ment study.
2 Manual Annotation Scheme
To create a corpus for the experiments below, we
added contextual polarity judgments to existing an-
notations in the Multi-perspective Question Answer-
ing (MPQA) Opinion Corpus1, namely to the an-
notations of subjective expressions2. A subjective
expression is any word or phrase used to express
an opinion, emotion, evaluation, stance, speculation,
1The MPQA Corpus is described in (Wiebe et al, 2005) and
available at nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm.
2In the MPQA Corpus, subjective expressions are direct
subjective expressions with non-neutral expression intensity,
plus all the expressive subjective elements. Please see (Wiebe
et al, 2005) for more details on the existing annotations in the
MPQA Corpus.
etc. A general covering term for such states is pri-
vate state (Quirk et al, 1985). In the MPQA Cor-
pus, subjective expressions of varying lengths are
marked, from single words to long phrases.
For this work, our focus is on sentiment expres-
sions ? positive and negative expressions of emo-
tions, evaluations, and stances. As these are types of
subjective expressions, to create the corpus, we just
needed to manually annotate the existing subjective
expressions with their contextual polarity.
In particular, we developed an annotation
scheme3 for marking the contextual polarity of sub-
jective expressions. Annotators were instructed to
tag the polarity of subjective expressions as positive,
negative, both, or neutral. The positive tag is for
positive emotions (I?m happy), evaluations (Great
idea!), and stances (She supports the bill). The neg-
ative tag is for negative emotions (I?m sad), eval-
uations (Bad idea!), and stances (She?s against the
bill). The both tag is applied to sentiment expres-
sions that have both positive and negative polarity.
The neutral tag is used for all other subjective ex-
pressions: those that express a different type of sub-
jectivity such as speculation, and those that do not
have positive or negative polarity.
Below are examples of contextual polarity anno-
tations. The tags are in boldface, and the subjective
expressions with the given tags are underlined.
(5) Thousands of coup supporters celebrated (posi-
tive) overnight, waving flags, blowing whistles . . .
(6) The criteria set by Rice are the following: the
three countries in question are repressive (nega-
tive) and grave human rights violators (negative)
. . .
(7) Besides, politicians refer to good and evil
(both) only for purposes of intimidation and
exaggeration.
(8) Jerome says the hospital feels (neutral) no dif-
ferent than a hospital in the states.
The annotators were asked to judge the contex-
tual polarity of the sentiment that is ultimately be-
ing conveyed by the subjective expression, i.e., once
the sentence has been fully interpreted. Thus, the
subjective expression, they have not succeeded, and

will never succeed, was marked as positive in the
sentence, They have not succeeded, and will never
succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people.
The reasoning is that breaking the will of a valiant
people is negative; hence, not succeeding in break-
ing their will is positive.
3 Agreement Study
To measure the reliability of the polarity annotation
scheme, we conducted an agreement study with two
annotators, using 10 documents from the MPQA
Corpus. The 10 documents contain 447 subjective
expressions. Table 1 shows the contingency table for
the two annotators? judgments. Overall agreement is
82%, with a Kappa (?) value of 0.72.
Neutral Positive Negative Both Total
Neutral 123 14 24 0 161
Positive 16 73 5 2 96
Negative 14 2 167 1 184
Both 0 3 0 3 6
Total 153 92 196 6 447
Table 1: Agreement for Subjective Expressions
(Agreement: 82%, ?: 0.72)
For 18% of the subjective expressions, at least one
annotator used an uncertain tag when marking po-
larity. If we consider these cases to be borderline
and exclude them from the study, percent agreement
increases to 90% and Kappa rises to 0.84. Thus, the
annotator agreement is especially high when both
are certain. (Note that all annotations are included
in the experiments described below.)
4 Corpus
In total, 15,991 subjective expressions from 425
documents (8,984 sentences) were annotated with
contextual polarity as described above. Of these sen-
tences, 28% contain no subjective expressions, 25%
contain only one, and 47% contain two or more. Of
the 4,247 sentences containing two or more subjec-
tive expressions, 17% contain mixtures of positive
and negative expressions, and 62% contain mixtures
of polar (positive/negative/both) and neutral subjec-
tive expressions.
The annotated documents are divided into two
sets. The first (66 documents/1,373 sentences/2,808
subjective expressions) is a development set, used
for data exploration and feature development. We
use the second set (359 documents/7,611 sen-
tences/13,183 subjective expressions) in 10-fold
cross-validation experiments, described below.
5 Prior-Polarity Subjectivity Lexicon
For the experiments in this paper, we use a lexicon of
over 8,000 subjectivity clues. Subjectivity clues are
words and phrases that may be used to express pri-
vate states, i.e., they have subjective usages (though
they may have objective usages as well). For this
work, only single-word clues are used.
To compile the lexicon, we began with a list of
subjectivity clues from (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).
The words in this list were grouped in previous work
according to their reliability as subjectivity clues.
Words that are subjective in most contexts were
marked strongly subjective (strongsubj), and those
that may only have certain subjective usages were
marked weakly subjective (weaksubj).
We expanded the list using a dictionary and a
thesaurus, and also added words from the General
Inquirer positive and negative word lists (General-
Inquirer, 2000) which we judged to be potentially
subjective. We also gave the new words reliability
tags, either strongsubj or weaksubj.
The next step was to tag the clues in the lexicon
with their prior polarity. For words that came from
positive and negative word lists (General-Inquirer,
2000; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), we
largely retained their original polarity, either posi-
tive or negative. We assigned the remaining words
one of the tags positive, negative, both or neutral.
By far, the majority of clues, 92.8%, are
marked as having either positive (33.1%) or nega-
tive (59.7%) prior polarity. Only a small number of
clues (0.3%) are marked as having both positive and
negative polarity. 6.9% of the clues in the lexicon
are marked as neutral. Examples of these are verbs
such as feel, look, and think, and intensifiers such as
deeply, entirely, and practically. These words are in-
cluded because, although their prior polarity is neu-
tral, they are good clues that a sentiment is being
expressed (e.g., feels slighted, look forward to). In-
cluding them increases the coverage of the system.

6 Experiments
The goal of the experiments described below is to
classify the contextual polarity of the expressions
that contain instances of the subjectivity clues in
our lexicon. What the system specifically does is
give each clue instance its own label. Note that the
system does not try to identify expression bound-
aries. Doing so might improve performance and is a
promising avenue for future research.
6.1 Definition of the Gold Standard
We define the gold standard used to train and test the
system in terms of the manual annotations described
in Section 2.
The gold standard class of a clue instance that is
not in a subjective expression is neutral: since the
clue is not even in a subjective expression, it is not
contained in a sentiment expression.
Otherwise, if a clue instance appears in just one
subjective expression (or in multiple subjective ex-
pressions with the same contextual polarity), then
the class assigned to the clue instance is the class
of the subjective expression(s). If a clue appears
in at least one positive and one negative subjective
expression (or in a subjective expression marked as
both), then its class is both. If it is in a mixture of
negative and neutral subjective expressions, its class
is negative; if it is in a mixture of positive and neu-
tral subjective expressions, its class is positive.
6.2 Performance of a Prior-Polarity Classifier
An important question is how useful prior polarity
alone is for identifying contextual polarity. To an-
swer this question, we create a classifier that sim-
ply assumes that the contextual polarity of a clue in-
stance is the same as the clue?s prior polarity, and we
explore the classifier?s performance on the develop-
ment set.
This simple classifier has an accuracy of 48%.
From the confusion matrix given in Table 2, we see
that 76% of the errors result from words with non-
neutral prior polarity appearing in phrases with neu-
tral contextual polarity.
6.3 Contextual Polarity Disambiguation
The fact that words with non-neutral prior polarity
so frequently appear in neutral contexts led us to

adopt a two-step approach to contextual polarity dis-
ambiguation. For the first step, we concentrate on
whether clue instances are neutral or polar in context
(where polar in context refers to having a contextual
polarity that is positive, negative or both). For the
second step, we take all clue instances marked as
polar in step one, and focus on identifying their con-
textual polarity. For both steps, we develop classi-
fiers using the BoosTexter AdaBoost.HM (Schapire
and Singer, 2000) machine learning algorithm with
5000 rounds of boosting. The classifiers are evalu-
ated in 10-fold cross-validation experiments.
6.3.1 Neutral-Polar Classification
The neutral-polar classifier uses 28 features, listed
in Table 3.
Word Features: Word context is a bag of three
word tokens: the previous word, the word itself, and
the next word. The prior polarity and reliability
class are indicated in the lexicon.
Modification Features: These are binary rela-
tionship features. The first four involve relationships
with the word immediately before or after: if the
word is a noun preceded by an adjective, if the pre-
ceding word is an adverb other than not, if the pre-
ceding word is an intensifier, and if the word itself
is an intensifier. A word is considered an intensifier
if it appears in a list of intensifiers and if it precedes
a word of the appropriate part-of-speech (e.g., an in-
tensifier adjective must come before a noun).
The modify features involve the dependency parse
tree for the sentence, obtained by first parsing the
sentence (Collins, 1997) and then converting the tree
into its dependency representation (Xia and Palmer,
2001). In a dependency representation, every node
in the tree structure is a surface word (i.e., there are
no abstract nodes such as NP or VP). The edge be-
tween a parent and a child specifies the grammatical
relationship between the two words. Figure 1 shows

an example. The modifies strongsubj/weaksubj fea-
tures are true if the word and its parent share an
adj, mod or vmod relationship, and if its parent is
an instance of a clue from the lexicon with strong-
subj/weaksubj reliability. The modified by strong-
subj/weaksubj features are similar, but look for rela-
tionships and clues in the word?s children.
Structure Features: These are binary features
that are determined by starting with the word in-
stance and climbing up the dependency parse tree
toward the root, looking for particular relationships,
words, or patterns. The in subject feature is true if
we find a subj relationship. The in copular feature is
true if in subject is false and if a node along the path
is both a main verb and a copular verb. The in pas-
sive features is true if a passive verb pattern is found
on the climb.
Sentence Features: These are features that were
found useful for sentence-level subjectivity classifi-
cation by Wiebe and Riloff (2005). They include
counts of strongsubj and weaksubj clues in the cur-
rent, previous and next sentences, counts of adjec-
tives and adverbs other than not in the current sen-
tence, and binary features to indicate whether the
sentence contains a pronoun, a cardinal number, and
a modal other than will.
Document Feature: There is one document fea-
ture representing the topic of the document. A doc-
ument may belong to one of 15 topics ranging from
specific (e.g., the 2002 presidential election in Zim-
babwe) to more general (e.g., economics) topics.
Table 4 gives neutral-polar classification results
for the 28-feature classifier and two simpler classi-
fiers that provide our baselines. The first row in the
table lists the results for a classifier that uses just
one feature, the word token. The second row shows
the results for a classifier that uses both the word to-
ken and the word?s prior polarity as features. The
results for the 28-feature classifier are listed in the
last row. The 28-feature classifier performs signifi-
cantly better (1-tailed t-test, p ? .05) than the two
simpler classifiers, as measured by accuracy, polar
F-measure, and neutral F-measure (? = 1). It has an
accuracy of 75.9%, with a polar F-measure of 63.4
and a neutral F-measure of 82.1.
Focusing on the metrics for polar expressions, it?s
interesting to note that using just the word token as a
feature produces a classifier with a precision slightly
better than the 28-feature classifier, but with a recall
that is 20% lower. Adding a feature for the prior

polarity improves recall so that it is only 4.4% lower,
but this hurts precision, which drops to 4.2% lower
than the 28-feature classifier?s precision. It is only
with all the features that we get the best result, good
precision with the highest recall.
The clues in the prior-polarity lexicon have
19,506 instances in the test set. According to the
28-feature neutral-polar classifier, 5,671 of these in-
stances are polar in context. It is these clue instances
that are passed on to the second step in the contex-
tual disambiguation process, polarity classification.
6.3.2 Polarity Classification
Ideally, this second step in the disambiguation
process would be a three-way classification task, de-
termining whether the contextual polarity is posi-
tive, negative or both. However, although the major-
ity of neutral expressions have been filtered out by
the neutral-polar classification in step one, a number
still remain. So, for this step, the polarity classifica-
tion task remains four-way: positive, negative, both,
and neutral.
Table 6 lists the features used by the polarity clas-
sifier. Word token and word prior polarity are un-
changed from the neutral-polar classifier. Negated
is a binary feature that captures whether the word is
being locally negated: its value is true if a negation
word or phrase is found within the four preceeding
words or in any of the word?s children in the de-
pendency tree, and if the negation word is not in a
phrase that intensifies rather than negates (e.g., not
only). The negated subject feature is true if the sub-
ject of the clause containing the word is negated.
The modifies polarity, modified by polarity, and
conj polarity features capture specific relationships
between the word instance and other polarity words
it may be related to. If the word and its parent in
the dependency tree share an obj, adj, mod, or vmod
relationship, the modifies polarity feature is set to
the prior polarity of the word?s parent (if the parent
is not in our prior-polarity lexicon, its prior polarity
is set to neutral). The modified by polarity feature
is similar, looking for adj, mod, and vmod relation-
ships and polarity clues within the word?s children.
The conj polarity feature determines if the word is
in a conjunction. If so, the value of this feature is its
sibling?s prior polarity (as above, if the sibling is not
in the lexicon, its prior polarity is neutral). Figure 1
helps to illustrate these features: modifies polarity is
negative for the word ?substantial,? modified by po-
larity is positive for the word ?challenge,? and conj
polarity is negative for the word ?good.?
The last three polarity features look in a window
of four words before, searching for the presence of
particular types of polarity influencers. General po-
larity shifters reverse polarity (e.g., little truth, lit-
tle threat). Negative polarity shifters typically make
the polarity of an expression negative (e.g., lack of
understanding). Positive polarity shifters typically
make the polarity of an expression positive (e.g.,
abate the damage).
The polarity classification results for this second
step in the contextual disambiguation process are
given in Table 5. Also listed in the table are results
for the two simple classifiers that provide our base-
lines. The first line in Table 5 lists the results for
the classifier that uses just one feature, the word to-
ken. The second line shows the results for the clas-
sifier that uses both the word token and the word?s
prior polarity as features. The last line shows the
results for the polarity classifier that uses all 10 fea-
tures from Table 6.
Mirroring the results from step one, the more
complex classifier performs significantly better than
the simpler classifiers, as measured by accuracy
and all of the F-measures. The 10-feature classi-
fier achieves an accuracy of 65.7%, which is 4.3%
higher than the more challenging baseline provided
by the word + prior polarity classifier. Positive F-
measure is 65.1 (5.7% higher); negative F-measure
is 77.2 (2.3% higher); and neutral F-measure is 46.2
(13.5% higher).
Focusing on the metrics for positive and negative
expressions, we again see that the simpler classifiers

take turns doing better or worse for precision and
recall. Using just the word token, positive preci-
sion is slightly higher than for the 10-feature clas-
sifier, but positive recall is 11.6% lower. Add the
prior polarity, and positive recall improves, but at
the expense of precision, which is 12.6% lower than
for the 10-feature classifier. The results for negative
expressions are similar. The word-token classifier
does well on negative recall but poorly on negative
precision. When prior polarity is added, negative
recall improves but negative precision drops. It is
only with the addition of the polarity features that we
achieve both higher precisions and higher recalls.
To explore how much the various polarity features
contribute to the performance of the polarity classi-
fier, we perform four experiments. In each experi-
ment, a different set of polarity features is excluded,
and the polarity classifier is retrained and evaluated.
Table 7 lists the features that are removed for each
experiment.
The only significant difference in performance in
these experiments is neutral F-measure when the
modification features (AB2) are removed. These
ablation experiments show that the combination of
features is needed to achieve significant results over
baseline for polarity classification.
7 Related Work
Much work on sentiment analysis classifies docu-
ments by their overall sentiment, for example deter-
mining whether a review is positive or negative (e.g.,
(Turney, 2002; Dave et al, 2003; Pang and Lee,
2004; Beineke et al, 2004)). In contrast, our ex-
periments classify individual words and phrases. A
number of researchers have explored learning words
and phrases with prior positive or negative polarity
(another term is semantic orientation) (e.g., (Hatzi-
vassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kamps and Marx,
2002; Turney, 2002)). In contrast, we begin with
a lexicon of words with established prior polarities,
and identify the contextual polarity of phrases in
which instances of those words appear in the cor-
pus. To make the relationship between that task
and ours clearer, note that some word lists used to
evaluate methods for recognizing prior polarity are
included in our prior-polarity lexicon (General In-
quirer lists (General-Inquirer, 2000) used for evalu-
ation by Turney, and lists of manually identified pos-
itive and negative adjectives, used for evaluation by
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown).
Some research classifies the sentiments of sen-
tences. Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Kim and
Hovy (2004), Hu and Liu (2004), and Grefenstette et
al. (2001)4 all begin by first creating prior-polarity
lexicons. Yu and Hatzivassiloglou then assign a sen-
timent to a sentence by averaging the prior semantic
orientations of instances of lexicon words in the sen-
tence. Thus, they do not identify the contextual po-
larity of individual phrases containing clues, as we
4In (Grefenstette et al, 2001), the units that are classified are
fixed windows around named entities rather than sentences.
353
do in this paper. Kim and Hovy, Hu and Liu, and
Grefenstette et al multiply or count the prior po-
larities of clue instances in the sentence. They also
consider local negation to reverse polarity. However,
they do not use the other types of features in our
experiments, and they restrict their tags to positive
and negative (excluding our both and neutral cate-
gories). In addition, their systems assign one sen-
timent per sentence; our system assigns contextual
polarity to individual expressions. As seen above,
sentences often contain more than one sentiment ex-
pression.
Nasukawa, Yi, and colleagues (Nasukawa and Yi,
2003; Yi et al, 2003) classify the contextual polarity
of sentiment expressions, as we do. Thus, their work
is probably most closely related to ours. They clas-
sify expressions that are about specific items, and
use manually developed patterns to classify polarity.
These patterns are high-quality, yielding quite high
precision, but very low recall. Their system classi-
fies a much smaller proportion of the sentiment ex-
pressions in a corpus than ours does.
8 Conclusions
In this paper, we present a new approach to
phrase-level sentiment analysis that first determines
whether an expression is neutral or polar and then
disambiguates the polarity of the polar expressions.
With this approach, we are able to automatically
identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of
sentiment expressions, achieving results that are sig-
nificantly better than baseline.

1 Introduction
OpinionFinder is a system that performs subjectivity
analysis, automatically identifying when opinions,
sentiments, speculations, and other private states are
present in text. Specifically, OpinionFinder aims to
identify subjective sentences and to mark various as-
pects of the subjectivity in these sentences, includ-
ing the source (holder) of the subjectivity and words
that are included in phrases expressing positive or
negative sentiments.
Our goal with OpinionFinder is to develop a sys-
tem capable of supporting other Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications by providing them
with information about the subjectivity in docu-
ments. Of particular interest are question answering
systems that focus on being able to answer opinion-
oriented questions, such as the following:
How is Bush?s decision not to ratify the
Kyoto Protocol looked upon by Japan and
other US allies?
How do the Chinese regard the human
rights record of the United States?
To answer these types of questions, a system needs
to be able to identify when opinions are expressed in
text and who is expressing them. Other applications
that would benefit from knowledge of subjective lan-
guage include systems that summarize the various
viewpoints in a document or that mine product re-
views. Even typical fact-oriented applications, such
as information extraction, can benefit from subjec-
tivity analysis by filtering out opinionated sentences
(Riloff et al, 2005).
2 OpinionFinder
OpinionFinder runs in two modes, batch and inter-
active. Document processing is largely the same for
both modes. In batch mode, OpinionFinder takes a
list of documents to process. Interactive mode pro-
vides a front-end that allows a user to query on-line
news sources for documents to process.
2.1 System Architecture Overview
OpinionFinder operates as one large pipeline. Con-
ceptually, the pipeline can be divided into two parts.
The first part performs mostly general purpose doc-
ument processing (e.g., tokenization and part-of-
speech tagging). The second part performs the sub-
jectivity analysis. The results of the subjectivity
analysis are returned to the user in the form of
SGML/XML markup of the original documents.
2.2 Document Processing
For general document processing, OpinionFinder
first runs the Sundance partial parser (Riloff and
Phillips, 2004) to provide semantic class tags, iden-
tify Named Entities, and match extraction patterns
that correspond to subjective language (Riloff and
Wiebe, 2003). Next, OpenNLP1 1.1.0 is used to tok-
enize, sentence split, and part-of-speech tag the data,
and the Abney stemmer2 is used to stem. In batch
mode, OpinionFinder parses the data again, this time
to obtain constituency parse trees (Collins, 1997),
which are then converted to dependency parse trees
(Xia and Palmer, 2001). Currently, this stage is only
1http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
2SCOL version 1g available at http://www.vinartus.net/spa/
34
available for batch mode processing due to the time
required for parsing. Finally, a clue-finder is run to
identify words and phrases from a large subjective
language lexicon.
2.3 Subjectivity Analysis
The subjectivity analysis has four components.
2.3.1 Subjective Sentence Classification
The first component is a Naive Bayes classifier
that distinguishes between subjective and objective
sentences using a variety of lexical and contextual
features (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Riloff and Wiebe,
2003). The classifier is trained using subjective and
objective sentences, which are automatically gener-
ated from a large corpus of unannotated data by two
high-precision, rule-based classifiers.
2.3.2 Speech Events and Direct Subjective
Expression Classification
The second component identifies speech events
(e.g., ?said,? ?according to?) and direct subjective
expressions (e.g., ?fears,? ?is happy?). Speech
events include both speaking and writing events.
Direct subjective expressions are words or phrases
where an opinion, emotion, sentiment, etc. is di-
rectly described. A high-precision, rule-based clas-
sifier is used to identify these expressions.
2.3.3 Opinion Source Identification
The third component is a source identifier that
combines a Conditional Random Field sequence
tagging model (Lafferty et al, 2001) and extraction
pattern learning (Riloff, 1996) to identify the sources
of speech events and subjective expressions (Choi
et al, 2005). The source of a speech event is the
speaker; the source of a subjective expression is the
experiencer of the private state. The source identifier
is trained on the MPQA Opinion Corpus3 using a
variety of features. Because the source identifier re-
lies on dependency parse information, it is currently
only available in batch mode.
2.3.4 Sentiment Expression Classification
The final component uses two classifiers to iden-
tify words contained in phrases that express pos-
itive or negative sentiments (Wilson et al, 2005).
3The MPQA Opinion Corpus can be freely obtained at
http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm.
The first classifier focuses on identifying sentiment
expressions. The second classifier takes the senti-
ment expressions and identifies those that are pos-
itive and negative. Both classifiers were developed
using BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000) and
trained on the MPQA Corpus.

Recognizing Contextual Polarity:
An Exploration of Features for Phrase-Level
Sentiment Analysis

Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked
with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of
the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the
word?s prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or
vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in
context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to
automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding
which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is
identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing
between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between
positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance
of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except
one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the
evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for
distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence
of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the
best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system?s ability to
identify when an instance is neutral.

inflammatory messages (Spertus 1997), to tracking sentiments over time in online
discussions (Tong 2001), to classifying positive and negative reviews (Pang, Lee, and
Vaithyanathan 2002; Turney 2002). Although a great deal of work in sentiment analy-
sis has targeted documents, applications such as opinion question answering (Yu and
Hatzivassiloglou 2003; Maybury 2004; Stoyanov, Cardie, and Wiebe 2005) and re-
view mining to extract opinions about companies and products (Morinaga et al 2002;
Nasukawa and Yi 2003) require sentence-level or even phrase-level analysis. For exam-
ple, if a question answering system is to successfully answer questions about people?s
opinions, it must be able not only to pinpoint expressions of positive and negative
sentiments, such as we find in sentence (1), but also to determine when an opinion is not
being expressed by a word or phrase that typically does evoke one, such as condemned
in sentence (2).
(1) African observers generally approved (positive) of his victory while
Western governments denounced (negative) it.
(2) Gavin Elementary School was condemned in April 2004.
A common approach to sentiment analysis is to use a lexicon with information
about which words and phrases are positive and which are negative. This lexicon may
be manually compiled, as is the case with the General Inquirer (Stone et al 1966), a
resource often used in sentiment analysis. Alternatively, the information in the lexicon
may be acquired automatically. Acquiring the polarity of words and phrases is itself
an active line of research in the sentiment analysis community, pioneered by the
work of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) on predicting the polarity or semantic
orientation of adjectives. Various techniques have been proposed for learning the
polarity of words. They include corpus-based techniques, such as using constraints
on the co-occurrence in conjunctions of words with similar or opposite polarity
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997) and statistical measures of word association
(Turney and Littman 2003), as well as techniques that exploit information about lexical
relationships (Kamps and Marx 2002; Kim and Hovy 2004) and glosses (Esuli and
Sebastiani 2005; Andreevskaia and Bergler 2006) in resources such as WordNet.
Acquiring the polarity of words and phrases is undeniably important, and there
are still open research challenges, such as addressing the sentiments of different senses
of words (Esuli and Sebastiani 2006b; Wiebe and Mihalcea 2006), and so on. However,
what the polarity of a given word or phrase is when it is used in a particular context is
another problem entirely. Consider, for example, the underlined positive and negative
words in the following sentence.
(3) Philip Clapp, president of the National Environment Trust, sums up well
the general thrust of the reaction of environmental movements: ?There is
no reason at all to believe that the polluters are suddenly going to become
reasonable.?
The first underlined word is Trust. Although many senses of the word trust express a
positive sentiment, in this case, the word is not being used to express a sentiment at
all. It is simply part of an expression referring to an organization that has taken on
the charge of caring for the environment. The adjective well is considered positive, and
indeed it is positive in this context. However, the same is not true for the words reason
400
Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann Recognizing Contextual Polarity
and reasonable. Out of context, we would consider both of these words to be positive.1
In context, the word reason is being negated, changing its polarity from positive to
negative. The phrase no reason at all to believe changes the polarity of the proposition that
follows; because reasonable falls within this proposition, its polarity becomes negative.
The word polluters has a negative connotation, but here in the context of the discussion
of the article and its position in the sentence, polluters is being used less to express a
sentiment and more to objectively refer to companies that pollute. To clarify how the
polarity of polluters is affected by its subject role, consider the purely negative sentiment
that emerges when it is used as an object: They are polluters.
We call the polarity that would be listed for a word in a lexicon the word?s prior
polarity, and we call the polarity of the expression in which a word appears, con-
sidering the context of the sentence and document, the word?s contextual polarity.
Although words often do have the same prior and contextual polarity, many times
a word?s prior and contextual polarities differ. Words with a positive prior polarity
may have a negative contextual polarity, or vice versa. Quite often words that are
positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning that they are not
even being used to express a sentiment. Similarly, words that are neutral out of context,
neither positive or negative, may combine to create a positive or negative expression in
context.
The focus of this work is on the recognition of contextual polarity?in particular,
disambiguating the contextual polarity of words with positive or negative prior polar-
ity. We begin by presenting an annotation scheme for marking sentiment expressions
and their contextual polarity in the Multi-perspective Question Answering (MPQA)
opinion corpus. We show that, given a set of subjective expressions (identified from
the existing annotations in the MPQA corpus), contextual polarity can be annotated
reliably.
Using the contextual polarity annotations, we conduct experiments in automatically
distinguishing between prior and contextual polarity. Beginning with a large lexicon of
clues tagged with prior polarity, we identify the contextual polarity of the instances
of those clues in the corpus. The process that we use has two steps, first classifying
each clue as being in a neutral or polar phrase, and then disambiguating the contextual
polarity of the clues marked as polar. For each step in the process, we experiment with a
variety of features and evaluate the performance of the features using several different
machine learning algorithms.
Our experiments reveal a number of interesting findings. First, being able to accu-
rately identify neutral contextual polarity?when a positive or negative clue is not being
used to express a sentiment?is an important aspect of the problem. The importance of
neutral examples has previously been noted for classifying the sentiment of documents
(Koppel and Schler 2006), but ours is the first work to explore how neutral instances
affect classifying the contextual polarity of words and phrases. In particular, we found
that the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative po-
larity greatly degrades when neutral instances are included in the experiments.
We also found that achieving the best performance for recognizing contextual po-
larity requires a wide variety of features. This is particularly true for distinguishing
1 It is open to question whether reason should be listed as positive in a sentiment lexicon, because the more
frequent senses of reason involve intention, not sentiment. However, any existing sentiment lexicon one
would start with will have some noise and errors. The task in this article is to disambiguate instances of
the entries in a given sentiment lexicon.

between neutral and polar instances. Although some features help to increase polar or
neutral recall or precision, it is only the combination of features together that achieves
significant improvements in accuracy over the baselines. Our experiments show that for
distinguishing between positive and negative instances, features capturing negation are
clearly the most important. However, there is more to the story than simple negation.
Features that capture relationships between instances of clues also perform well, indi-
cating that identifying features that represent more complex interdependencies between
sentiment clues may be an important avenue for future research.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview
of some of the things that can influence contextual polarity. In Section 3, we describe
our corpus and present our annotation scheme and inter-annotator agreement study
for marking contextual polarity. Sections 4 and 5 describe the lexicon used in our
experiments and how the contextual polarity annotations are used to determine the
gold-standard tags for instances from the lexicon. In Section 6, we consider what kind of
performance can be expected from a simple, prior-polarity classifier. Section 7 describes
the features that we use for recognizing contextual polarity, and our experiments
and results are presented in Section 8. In Section 9 we discuss related work, and we
conclude in Section 10.
2. Polarity Influencers
Phrase-level sentiment analysis is not a simple problem. Many things besides negation
can influence contextual polarity, and even negation is not always straightforward.
Negation may be local (e.g., not good), or involve longer-distance dependencies such as
the negation of the proposition (e.g., does not look very good) or the negation of the subject
(e.g., no one thinks that it?s good). In addition, certain phrases that contain negation words
intensify rather than change polarity (e.g., not only good but amazing). Contextual polarity
may also be influenced bymodality: whether the proposition is asserted to be real (realis)
or not real (irrealis) (no reason at all to believe is irrealis, for example); word sense (e.g.,
Environmental Trust vs. He has won the people?s trust); the syntactic role of a word in the
sentence: whether the word is the subject or object of a copular verb (consider polluters
are versus they are polluters); and diminishers such as little (e.g., little truth, little threat).
Polanyi and Zaenen (2004) give a detailed discussion of many of these types of polarity
influencers. Many of these contextual polarity influencers are represented as features in
our experiments.
Contextual polarity may also be influenced by the domain or topic. For example,
the word cool is positive if used to describe a car, but it is negative if it is used to
describe someone?s demeanor. Similarly, a word such as fever is unlikely to be expressing
a sentiment when used in a medical context. We use one feature in our experiments to
represent the topic of the document.
Another important aspect of contextual polarity is the perspective of the person
who is expressing the sentiment. For example, consider the phrase failed to defeat
in the sentence Israel failed to defeat Hezbollah. From the perspective of Israel, failed
to defeat is negative. From the perspective of Hezbollah, failed to defeat is positive.
Therefore, the contextual polarity of this phrase ultimately depends on the perspec-
tive of who is expressing the sentiment. Although automatically detecting this kind
of pragmatic influence on polarity is beyond the scope of this work, this as well as
the other types of polarity influencers all are considered when annotating contextual
polarity.

3. Data and Annotations
For the experiments in this work, we need a corpus that is annotated comprehensively
for sentiment expressions and their contextual polarity. Rather than building a corpus
from scratch, we chose to add contextual polarity annotations to the existing annota-
tions in the Multi-perspective Question Answering (MPQA) opinion corpus2 (Wiebe,
Wilson, and Cardie 2005).
The MPQA corpus is a collection of English-language versions of news documents
from the world press. The documents contain detailed, expression-level annotations
of attributions and private states (Quirk et al 1985). Private states are mental and
emotional states; they include beliefs, speculations, intentions, and sentiments, among
others. Although sentiments are not distinguished from other types of private states
in the existing annotations, they are a subset of what already is annotated. This makes
the annotations in the MPQA corpus a good starting point for annotating sentiment
expressions and their contextual polarity.
3.1 Annotation Scheme
When developing our annotation scheme for sentiment expressions and contextual
polarity, there were three main questions to address. First, which of the existing annota-
tions in the MPQA corpus have the possibility of being sentiment expressions? Second,
which of the possible sentiment expressions actually are expressing sentiments? Third,
what coding scheme should be used for marking contextual polarity?
TheMPQA annotation scheme has four types of annotations: objective speech event
frames, two types of private state frames, and agent frames that are used for marking
speakers of speech events and experiencers of private states. A full description of
the MPQA annotation scheme and an agreement study evaluating key aspects of the
scheme are found in Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie (2005).
The two types of private state frames, direct subjective frames and expressive sub-
jective element frames, are where we will find sentiment expressions. Direct subjective
frames are used to mark direct references to private states as well as speech events in
which private states are being expressed. For example, in the following sentences, fears,
praised, and said are all marked as direct subjective annotations.
(4) The U.S. fears a spill-over of the anti-terrorist campaign.
(5) Italian senator Renzo Gubert praised the Chinese government?s efforts.
(6) ?The report is full of absurdities,? he said.
The word fears directly refers to a private state; praised refers to a speech event
in which a private state is being expressed; and said is marked as direct subjective
because a private state is being expressed within the speech event referred to by
said. Expressive subjective elements indirectly express private states through the way
something is described or through a particular wording. In example (6), the phrase
full of absurdities is an expressive subjective element. Subjectivity (Banfield 1982; Wiebe
2 Available at http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm.
403
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 3
1994) refers to the linguistic expression of private states, hence the names for the two
types of private state annotations.
All expressive subjective elements are included in the set of annotations that have
the possibility of being sentiment expressions, but the direct subjective frames to include
in this set can be pared down further. Direct subjective frames have an attribute, expres-
sion intensity, that captures the contribution of the annotated word or phrase to the
overall intensity of the private state being expressed. Expression intensity ranges from
neutral to high. In the given sentences, fears and praised have an expression intensity of
medium, and said has an expression intensity of neutral. A neutral expression intensity
indicates that the direct subjective phrase itself is not contributing to the expression
of the private state. If this is the case, then the direct subjective phrase cannot be
a sentiment expression. Thus, only direct subjective annotations with a non-neutral
expression intensity are included in the set of annotations that have the possibility of
being sentiment expressions. We call this set of annotations, the union of the expres-
sive subjective elements and the direct subjective frames with a non-neutral intensity,
the subjective expressions in the corpus; these are the annotations we will mark for
contextual polarity.
Table 1 gives a sample of subjective expressions marked in the MPQA corpus.
Although many of the words and phrases express what we typically think of as
sentiments, others do not, for example, believes, very definitely, and unconditionally and
without delay.
Now that we have identified which annotations have the possibility of being sen-
timent expressions, the next question is which of these annotated words and phrases
are actually expressing sentiments. We define a sentiment as a positive or negative
emotion, evaluation, or stance. On the left of Table 2 are examples of positive sentiments;
examples of negative sentiments are on the right.

The final issue to address is the actual annotation scheme for marking contextual
polarity. The scheme we developed has four tags: positive, negative, both, and neutral.
The positive tag is used to mark positive sentiments. The negative tag is used to mark
negative sentiments. The both tag is applied to expressions in which both a positive and
negative sentiment are being expressed. Subjective expressions with positive, negative, or
both tags are our sentiment expressions. The neutral tag is used for all other subjective
expressions, including emotions, evaluations, and stances that are neither positive or
negative. Instructions for the contextual-polarity annotation scheme are available at
http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/databaserelease/polarityCodingInstructions.txt.
Following are examples from the corpus of each of the different contextual-polarity
annotations. Each underlinedword or phrase is a subjective expression that wasmarked
in the original MPQA annotations.3 In bold following each subjective expression is the
contextual polarity with which it was annotated.
(7) Thousands of coup supporters celebrated (positive) overnight, waving
flags, blowing whistles . . .
(8) The criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in question are
repressive (negative) and grave human rights violators (negative) . . .
(9) Besides, politicians refer to good and evil (both) only for purposes of
intimidation and exaggeration.
(10) Jerome says the hospital feels (neutral) no different than a hospital in the
states.
As a final note on the annotation scheme, annotators are asked to judge the con-
textual polarity of the sentiment that is ultimately being conveyed by the subjective
expression, that is, once the sentence has been fully interpreted. Thus, the subjective
expression, they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, is marked as positive in the
following sentence:
(11) They have not succeeded, and will never succeed (positive), in breaking
the will of this valiant people.
The reasoning is that breaking the will of a valiant people is negative, so to not succeed
in breaking their will is positive.
3 Some sentences contain additional subjective expressions that are not underlined as examples.

3.2 Agreement Study
To measure the reliability of the polarity annotation scheme, we conducted an agree-
ment study with two annotators4 using 10 documents from the MPQA corpus. The 10
documents contain 447 subjective expressions. Table 3 shows the contingency table for
the two annotators? judgments. Overall agreement is 82%, with a kappa value of 0.72.
As part of the annotation scheme, annotators are asked to judge how certain they
are in their polarity tags. For 18% of the subjective expressions, at least one annotator
used the uncertain tag whenmarking polarity. If we consider these cases to be borderline
and exclude them from the study, percent agreement increases to 90% and kappa rises to
0.84. Table 4 shows the revised contingency table with the uncertain cases removed. This
shows that annotator agreement is especially highwhen both annotators are certain, and
that annotators are certain for over 80% of their tags.
Note that all annotations are included in the experiments.
3.3 Contextual Polarity Annotations
In total, all 19,962 subjective expressions in the 535 documents (11,112 sentences) of the
MPQA corpus were annotated with their contextual polarity as just described.5 Three
annotators carried out the task: the two who participated in the annotation study and
a third who was trained later.6 Table 5 gives the distribution of the contextual polarity
tags. Looking at this table, we see that a small majority of subjective expressions (54.6%)

that of the first two annotators who participated in the study.

are expressing a positive, negative, or both (positive and negative) sentiment. We refer to
these expressions as polar in context. Many of the subjective expressions are neutral
and do not express a sentiment. This suggests that, although sentiment is a major type
of subjectivity, distinguishing other prominent types of subjectivity will be important
for future work in subjectivity analysis.
As many NLP applications operate at the sentence level, one important issue to
consider is the distribution of sentences with respect to the subjective expressions
they contain. In the 11,112 sentences in the MPQA corpus, 28% contain no subjective
expressions, 24% contain only one, and 48% contain two or more. Of the 5,304 sentences
containing two or more subjective expressions, 17% contain mixtures of positive and
negative expressions, and 61% contain mixtures of polar (positive/negative/both) and
neutral subjective expressions.
4. Prior-Polarity Subjectivity Lexicon
For the experiments in this article, we use a lexicon of over 8,000 subjectivity clues.
Subjectivity clues are words and phrases that may be used to express private states. In
other words, subjectivity clues have subjective usages, though they may have objective
usages as well. For this work, only single-word clues are used.
To compile the lexicon, we began with the list of subjectivity clues from Riloff and
Wiebe (2003), which includes the positive and negative adjectives fromHatzivassiloglou
and McKeown (1997). The words in this list were grouped in previous work according
to their reliability as subjectivity clues. Words that are subjective in most contexts are
considered strong subjective clues, indicated by the strongsubj tag. Words that may
only have certain subjective usages are considered weak subjective clues, indicated by
the weaksubj tag.
We expanded the list using a dictionary and a thesaurus, and added words from the
General Inquirer positive and negative word lists (Stone et al 1966) that we judged to be
potentially subjective.7 We also gave the new words strongsubj and weaksubj reliability
tags. The final lexicon has a coverage of 67% of subjective expressions in the MPQA
corpus, where coverage is the percentage of subjective expressions containing one or
more instances of clues from the lexicon. The coverage of just sentiment expressions is
even higher: 75%.
The next step was to tag the clues in the lexicon with their prior polarity: positive,
negative, both, or neutral. A word in the lexicon is tagged as positive if out of context
it seems to evoke something positive, and negative if it seems to evoke something
negative. If a word has both positive and negative meanings, it is tagged with the
polarity that seems the most common. A word is tagged as both if it is at the same time
7 In the end, about 70% of the words from the General Inquirer positive word list and 80% of the words
from the negative word list were included in the subjectivity lexicon.
407
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 3
both positive and negative. For example, the word bittersweet evokes something both
positive and negative. Words like brag are also tagged as both, because the one who is
bragging is expressing something positive, yet at the same time describing someone as
bragging is expressing a negative evaluation of that person. A word is tagged as neutral
if it does not evoke anything positive or negative.
For words that came from positive and negative word lists (Stone et al 1966;
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997), we largely retained their original polarity.
However, we did change the polarity of a word if we strongly disagreed with its
original class.8 For example, the word apocalypse is listed as positive in the General
Inquirer; we changed its prior polarity to negative for our lexicon.
By far, the majority of clues in the lexicon (92.8%) are marked as having either
positive (33.1%) or negative (59.7%) prior polarity. Only a small number of clues (0.3%)
are marked as having both positive and negative polarity. We refer to the set of clues
marked as positive, negative, or both as sentiment clues. A total of 6.9% of the clues in
the lexicon are marked as neutral. Examples of neutral clues are verbs such as feel, look,
and think, and intensifiers such as deeply, entirely, and practically. Although the neutral
clues make up a small proportion of the total words in the lexicon, we retain them for
our later experiments in recognizing contextual polarity because many of them are good
clues that a sentiment is being expressed (e.g., feels slighted, feels satisfied, look kindly on,
look forward to). Including them increases the coverage of the system.
At the end of the previous section, we considered the distribution of sentences in the
MPQA corpus with respect to the subjective expressions they contain. It is interesting
to compare that distribution with the distribution of sentences with respect to the
instances they contain of clues from the lexicon. We find that there are more sentences
with two or more clue instances (62%) than sentences with two or more subjective
expressions (48%). More importantly, many more sentences have mixtures of positive
and negative clue instances than actually have mixtures of positive and negative sub-
jective expressions. Only 880 sentences have a mixture of both positive and negative
subjective expressions, whereas 3,234 sentences have a mixture of positive and negative
clue instances. Thus, a large number of positive and negative instances are either neutral
in context, or they are combining to form more complex polarity expressions. Either
way, this provides strong evidence of the need to be able to disambiguate the contextual
polarity of subjectivity and sentiment clues.
5. Definition of the Gold Standard
In the experiments described in the following sections, the goal is to classify the con-
textual polarity of the expressions that contain instances of the subjectivity clues in our
lexicon. However, determining which clue instances are part of the same expression and
identifying expression boundaries are not the focus of this work. Thus, instead of trying
to identify and label each expression, in the following experiments, each clue instance
is labeled individually as to its contextual polarity.
We define the gold-standard contextual polarity of a clue instance in terms of the
manual annotations (Section 3) as follows. If a clue instance is not in a subjective
expression (and therefore not in a sentiment expression), its gold class is neutral. If
a clue instance appears in just one subjective expression or in multiple subjective
8 We decided on a different polarity for about 80 of the words in our lexicon that appeared on other
positive and negative word lists.
408
Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann Recognizing Contextual Polarity
expressions with the same contextual polarity, its gold class is the contextual polarity
of the subjective expression(s). If a clue instance appears in a mixture of negative and
neutral subjective expressions, its gold class is negative; if it is in amixture of positive and
neutral subjective expressions, its gold class is positive. Finally, if a clue instance appears
in at least one positive and one negative subjective expression (or in a subjective ex-
pression marked as both), then its gold class is both. A clue instance can appear in more
than one subjective expression because in the MPQA annotation scheme, it is possible
for direct subjective frames and expressive subjective elements frames to overlap.
6. A Prior-Polarity Classifier
Before delving into the task of recognizing contextual polarity, an important question
to address is how useful prior polarity alone is for identifying contextual polarity. To
answer this question, we create a classifier that simply assumes the contextual polarity
of a clue instance is the same as the clue?s prior polarity. We explore this classifier?s
performance on a small amount of development data, which is not part of the data used
in the subsequent experiments.
This simple classifier has an accuracy of 48%. From the confusion matrix given in
Table 6, we see that 76% of the errors result from words with non-neutral prior polarity
appearing in phrases with neutral contextual polarity. Only 12% of the errors result from
words with neutral prior polarity appearing in expressions with non-neutral contextual
polarity, and only 11% of the errors come from words with a positive or negative prior
polarity appearing in expressions with the opposite contextual polarity. Table 6 also
shows that positive clues tend to be used in negative expressions far more often than
negative clues tend to be used in positive expressions.
Given that by far the largest number of errors come from clues with positive,
negative, or both prior polarity appearing in neutral contexts, we were motivated to try
a two-step approach to the problem of sentiment classification. The first step, Neutral?
Polar Classification, tries to determine if an instance is neutral or polar in context. The
second step, Polarity Classification, takes all instances that step one classified as polar,
and tries to disambiguate their contextual polarity. This two-step approach is illustrated
in Figure 1.
7. Features
The features used in our experiments were motivated both by the literature and by
exploration of the contextual-polarity annotations in our development data. A number

of features were inspired by the paper on contextual-polarity influencers by Polanyi
and Zaenan (2004). Other features are those that have been found useful in the past
for recognizing subjective sentences (Wiebe, Bruce, and O?Hara 1999; Wiebe and Riloff
2005).
7.1 Features for Neutral?Polar Classification
For distinguishing between neutral and polar instances, we use the features listed in
Table 7. For ease of description, we group the features into six sets: word features, gen-
eral modification features, polarity modification features, structure features, sentence
features, and one document feature.
Word Features In addition to the word token (the token of the clue instance being
classified), the word features include the parts of speech of the previous word, the word
itself, and the next word. The prior polarity and reliability class features represent those
pieces of information about the clue which are taken from the lexicon.
General Modification Features These are binary features that capture different
types of relationships involving the clue instance.
The first four features involve relationships with the word immediately before or af-
ter the clue instance. The preceded by adjective feature is true if the clue instance is a noun
preceded by an adjective. The preceded by adverb feature is true if the preceding word
is an adverb other than not. The preceded by intensifier feature is true if the preceding
word is an intensifier, and the self intensifier feature is true if the clue instance itself is an
intensifier. A word is considered to be an intensifier if it appears in a list of intensifiers
and if it precedes a word of the appropriate part of speech (e.g., an intensifier adjective
must come before a noun). The list of intensifiers is a compilation of those listed in Quirk
et al (1985), intensifiers identified from existing entries in the subjectivity lexicon, and
intensifiers identified during explorations of the development data.
The modifies/modifed by features involve the dependency parse tree of the sentence,
obtained by first parsing the sentence (Collins 1997) and then converting the tree into
its dependency representation (Xia and Palmer 2001). In a dependency representation,
every node in the tree structure is a surface word (i.e., there are no abstract nodes such
as NP or VP). The parent word is called the head, and its children are its modifiers. The

edge between a parent and a child specifies the grammatical relationship between the
two words. Figure 2 shows an example of a dependency parse tree. Instances of clues in
the tree are marked with the clue?s prior polarity and reliability class from the lexicon.
For each clue instance, the modifies/modifed by features capture whether there are
adj, mod, or vmod relationships between the clue instance and any other instances from
the lexicon. Specifically, the modifies strongsubj feature is true if the clue instance and
its parent share an adj, mod, or vmod relationship, and if its parent is an instance of
a strongsubj clue from the lexicon. The modifies weaksubj feature is the same, except
that it looks in the parent for an instance of a weaksubj clue. The modified by strongsubj

feature is true for a clue instance if one of its children is an instance of a strongsubj
clue, and if the clue instance and its child share an adj, mod, or vmod relationship. The
modified by weaksubj feature is the same, except that it looks for instances of weaksubj
clues in the children. Although the adj and vmod relationships are typically local, the
mod relationship involves longer-distance as well as local dependencies. Figure 2 helps
to illustrate these features. The modifies weaksubj feature is true for substantial, because
substantial modifies challenge, which is an instance of a weaksubj clue. For rights, the
modifies weaksubj feature is false, because rightsmodifies report, which is not an instance
of a weaksubj clue. The modified by weaksubj feature is false for substantial, because it has
no modifiers that are instances of weaksubj clues. For challenge, the modified by weaksubj
feature is true because it is being modified by substantial, which is an instance of a
weaksubj clue.
Polarity Modification Features The modifies polarity, modified by polarity, and conj
polarity features capture specific relationships between the clue instance and other senti-
ment clues it may be related to. If the clue instance and its parent in the dependency tree
share an obj, adj, mod, or vmod relationship, the modifies polarity feature is set to the prior
polarity of the parent. If the parent is not in the prior-polarity lexicon, its prior polarity
is considered neutral. If the clue instance is at the root of the tree and has no parent,
the value of the feature is notmod. The modified by polarity feature is similar, looking
for adj,mod, and vmod relationships and other sentiment clues in the children of the clue
instance. The conj polarity feature determines if the clue instance is in a conjunction. If so,
the value of this feature is its sibling?s prior polarity. As before, if the sibling is not in the
412
Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann Recognizing Contextual Polarity
lexicon, its prior polarity is neutral. If the clue instance is not in a conjunction, the value
for this feature is notmod. Figure 2 also helps to illustrate thesemodification features. The
word substantial with positive prior polarity modifies the word challenge with negative
prior polarity. Therefore the modifies polarity feature is negative for substantial, and the
modified by polarity feature is positive for challenge. The words good and evil are in a con-
junction together; thus the conj polarity feature is negative for good and positive for evil.
Structure Features These are binary features that are determined by starting with
the clue instance and climbing up the dependency parse tree toward the root, looking
for particular relationships, words, or patterns. The in subject feature is true if we find
a subj relationship on the path to the root. The in copular feature is true if in subject is
false and if a node along the path is both a main verb and a copular verb. The in passive
feature is true if a passive verb pattern is found on the climb.
The in subject and in copular features were motivated by the intuition that the syn-
tactic role of a word may influence whether a word is being used to express a sentiment.
For example, consider the word polluters in each of the following two sentences.
(12) Under the application shield, polluters are allowed to operate if they have
a permit.
(13) ?The big-city folks are pointing at the farmers and saying you are
polluters . . . ?
In the first sentence, polluters is simply being used as a referring expression. In the
second sentence, polluters is clearly being used to express a negative evaluation of the
farmers. Themotivation for the in passive feature was previous work by Riloff andWiebe
(2003), who found that different words aremore or less likely to be subjective depending
on whether they are in the active or passive.
Sentence Features These are features that previously were found useful for
sentence-level subjectivity classification (Wiebe, Bruce, and O?Hara 1999; Wiebe and
Riloff 2005). They include counts of strongsubj and weaksubj clue instances in the cur-
rent, previous and next sentences, counts of adjectives and adverbs other than not in
the current sentence, and binary features to indicate whether the sentence contains a
pronoun, a cardinal number, and a modal other than will.
Document Feature There is one document feature representing the topic or domain
of the document. The motivation for this feature is that whether or not a word is
expressing a sentiment or even a private state in general may depend on the subject
of the discourse. For example, the words fever and sufferer may express a negative
sentiment in certain contexts, but probably not in a health or medical context, as is the
case in the following sentence.
(14) The disease can be contracted if a person is bitten by a certain tick or if a
person comes into contact with the blood of a congo fever sufferer.
In the creation of the MPQA corpus, about two-thirds of the documents were
selected to be on one of the 10 topics listed in Table 8. The documents for each topic were
identified by human searches and by an information retrieval system. The remaining
documents were semi-randomly selected from a very large pool of documents from
the world press. In the corpus, these documents are listed with the topic miscellaneous.
Rather than leaving these documents unlabeled, we chose to label them using the

7.2 Features for Polarity Classification
Table 9 lists the features that we use for step two, polarity classification. Word token,
word prior polarity, and the polarity-modification features are the same as described for
neutral?polar classification.
We use two features to capture two different types of negation. The negated feature
is a binary feature that is used to capture more local negations: Its value is true if a
negation word or phrase is found within the four words preceding the clue instance,
and if the negation word is not also in a phrase that acts as an intensifier rather than a
negator. Examples of phrases that intensify rather than negate are not only and nothing if
not. The negated subject feature captures a longer-distance type of negation. This feature

is true if the subject of the clause containing the clue instance is negated. For example,
the negated subject feature is true for support in the following sentence.
(15) No politically prudent Israeli could support either of them.
The last three polarity features look in a window of four words before the clue
instance, searching for the presence of particular types of polarity influencers. Gen-
eral polarity shifters reverse polarity (e.g., little truth, little threat). Negative polarity
shifters typically make the polarity of an expression negative (e.g., lack of understand-
ing). Positive polarity shifters typically make the polarity of an expression positive
(e.g., abate the damage). The polarity influencers that we used were identified through
explorations of the development data.
8. Experiments in Recognizing Contextual Polarity
We have two primary goals with our experiments in recognizing contextual polarity.
The first is to evaluate the features described in Section 7 as to their usefulness for
this task. The second is to investigate the importance of recognizing neutral instances?
recognizing when a sentiment clue is not being used to express a sentiment?for classi-
fying contextual polarity.
To evaluate features, we investigate their performance, both together and sep-
arately, across several different learning algorithms. Varying the learning algorithm
allows us to verify that the features are robust and that their performance is not the
artifact of a particular algorithm. We experiment with four different types of machine
learning: boosting, memory-based learning, rule learning, and support vector learning.
For boosting, we use BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer 2000) AdaBoost.MH. For rule
learning, we use Ripper (Cohen 1996). For memory-based learning, we use TiMBL
(Daelemans et al 2003b) IB1 (k-nearest neighbor). For support vector learning, we
use SVM-light and SVM-multiclass (Joachims 1999). SVM-light is used for the experi-
ments involving binary classification (neutral?polar classification), and SVM-multiclass
is used for experiments with more than two classes. These machine learning algorithms
were chosen because they have been used successfully for a number of natural language
processing tasks, and they represent several different types of learning.
For all of the classification algorithms except for SVM, the features for a clue in-
stance are represented as they are presented in Section 7. For SVM, the representations
for numeric and discrete-valued features are changed. Numeric features, such as the
count of strongsubj clue instances in a sentence, are scaled to range between 0 and 1.
Discrete-valued features, such as the reliability class feature, are converted into multiple
binary features. For example, the reliability class feature is represented by two binary
features: one for whether the clue instance is a strongsubj clue and one for whether the
clue instance is a weaksubj clue.
To investigate the importance of recognizing neutral instances, we perform two sets
of polarity classification (step two) experiments. First, we experiment with classifying
the polarity of all gold-standard polar instances?the clue instances identified as polar
in context by the manual polarity annotations. Second, we experiment with using the
polar instances identified automatically by the neutral?polar classifiers. Because the
second set of experiments includes the neutral instances misclassified in step one, we
can compare results for the two sets of experiments to see how the noise of neutral
instances affects the performance of the polarity features.

All experiments are performed using 10-fold cross validation over a test set of
10,287 sentences from 494MPQA corpus documents. Wemeasure performance in terms
of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure. Accuracy is simply the total number of
instances correctly classified. Recall, precision, and F-measure for a given class C are
defined as follows. Recall is the percentage of all instances of class C correctly identified.
Rec(C) =
| instances of C correctly identified |
| all instances of C |
Precision is the percentage of instances classified as class C that are class C in truth.
Prec(C) =
| instances of C correctly identified |
| all instances identified as C |
F-measure is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.
F(C) =
2 ?Rec(C)? Prec(C)
Rec(C)+ Prec(C)
All results reported are averages over the 10 folds.
8.1 Neutral?Polar Classification
In our two-step process for recognizing contextual polarity, the first step is neutral?polar
classification, determining whether each instance of a clue from the lexicon is neutral or
polar in context. In our test set, there are 26,729 instances of clues from the lexicon. The
features we use for this step were listed above in Table 7 and described in Section 7.1.
In this section, we perform two sets of experiments. In the first, we compare
the results of neutral?polar classification using all the neutral?polar features against
two baselines. The first baseline uses just the word token feature. The second baseline
(word+priorpol) uses the word token and prior polarity features. In the second set of
experiments, we explore the performance of different sets of features for neutral?polar
classification.
Research has shown that the performance of learning algorithms for NLP tasks can
vary widely depending on their parameter settings, and that the optimal parameter
settings can also vary depending on the set of features being evaluated (Daelemans
et al 2003a; Hoste 2005). Although the goal of this work is not to identify the optimal
configuration for each algorithm and each set of features, we still want to make a rea-
sonable attempt to find a good configuration for each algorithm. To do this, we perform
10-fold cross validation of the more challenging baseline classifier (word+priorpol)
on the development data, varying select parameter settings. The results from those
experiments are then used to select the parameter settings for each algorithm. For
BoosTexter, we vary the number of rounds of boosting. For TiMBL, we vary the value
for k (the number of neighbors) and the distance metric (overlap or modified value
difference metric [MVDM]). For Ripper, we vary whether negative tests are disallowed
for nominal (-!n) and set (-!s) valued attributes and howmuch to simplify the hypothesis
(-S). For SVM, we experiment with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function kernels.
Table 10 gives the settings selected for the neutral?polar classification experiments for
the different learning algorithms.

8.1.1 Classification Results. The results for the first set of experiments are given in
Table 11. For each algorithm, we give the results for the two baseline classifiers, followed
by the results for the classifier trained using all the neutral?polar features. The results
shown in bold are significantly better than both baselines (two-sided t-test, p? 0.05) for
the given algorithm.
Working together, how well do the neutral?polar features perform? For BoosTexter,
TiMBL, and Ripper, the classifiers trained using all the features improve significantly
over the two baselines in terms of accuracy, polar recall, polar F-measure, and neutral
precision. Neutral F-measure is also higher, but not significantly so. These consistent
results across three of the four algorithms show that the neutral?polar features are
helpful for determining when a sentiment clue is actually being used to express a
sentiment.
Interestingly, Ripper is the only algorithm for which the word-token baseline per-
formed better than the word+priorpol baseline. Nevertheless, the prior polarity feature
is an important component in the performance of the Ripper classifier using all the
features. Excluding prior polarity from this classifier results in a significant decrease in

performance for every metric. Decreases range from 2.5% for neutral recall to 9.5% for
polar recall.
The best SVM classifier is the word+priorpol baseline. In terms of accuracy, this
classifier does not perform much worse than the BoosTexter and TiMBL classifiers that
use all the neutral?polar features: The SVM word+priorpol baseline classifier has an
accuracy of 75.6%, and both the BoosTexter and TiMBL classifiers have an accuracy of
76.5%. However, the BoosTexter and TiMBL classifiers using all the features perform
notably better in terms of polar recall and F-measure. The BoosTexter and TiMBL
classifiers have polar recalls that are 7% and 9.2% higher than the SVM baseline. Polar
F-measures for BoosTexter and TiMBL are 3.9% and 4.5% higher. These increases are
significant for p ? 0.01.
8.1.2 Feature Set Evaluation. To evaluate the contribution of the various features for
neutral?polar classification, we perform a series of experiments in which different
sets of neutral?polar features are added to the word+priorpol baseline and new clas-
sifiers are trained. We then compare the performance of these new classifiers to the
word+priorpol baseline, with the exception of the Ripper classifiers, which we compare
to the higher word baseline. Table 12 lists the sets of features tested in these experiments.
The feature sets generally correspond to how the neutral?polar features are presented
in Table 7, although some of the groups are broken down into more fine-grained sets
that we believe capture meaningful distinctions.
Table 13 gives the results for these experiments. Increases and decreases for a
given metric as compared to the word+priorpol baseline (word baseline for Ripper)
are indicated by + or ?, respectively. Where changes are significant at the p ? 0.1 level,
++ or ? ? are used, and where changes are significant at the p ? 0.05 level, +++ or ? ? ?
are used. An ?nc? indicates no change (a change of less than ? 0.05) compared to the
baseline.
What does Table 13 reveal about the performance of various feature sets for neutral?
polar classification?Most noticeable is that no individual feature sets stand out as strong
performers. The only significant improvements in accuracy come from the PARTS-
OF-SPEECH and RELIABILITY-CLASS feature sets for Ripper. These improvements are
perhaps not surprising given that the Ripper baseline was much lower to begin with.
Very few feature sets show any improvement for SVM. Again, this is not unexpected
given that all the features together performed worse than the word+priorpol baseline

for SVM. The performance of the feature sets for BoosTexter and TiMBL are perhaps
the most revealing. In the previous experiments using all the features together, these
algorithms produced classifiers with the same high performance. In these experiments,
six different feature sets for each algorithm show improvements in accuracy over the
baseline, yet none of those improvements are significant. This suggests that achieving
the highest performance for neutral?polar classification requires a wide variety of fea-
tures working together in combination.
We further test this result by evaluating the effect of removing the features that
produced either no change or a drop in accuracy from the respective all-feature classi-
fiers. For example, we train a TiMBL neutral?polar classifier using all the features except
for those in the PRECEDED-POS, INTENSIFY, STRUCTURE, CURSENT-COUNTS, and TOPIC
feature sets, and then compare the performance of this new classifier to the TiMBL, all-
feature classifier. Although removing the non-performing features has little effect for
BoosTexter, performance does drop for both TiMBL and Ripper. The primary source of
this performance drop is a decrease in polar recall: 2% for TiMBL and 3.2% for Ripper.
419
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 3
Although no feature sets stand out in Table 13 as far as giving an overall high
performance, there are some features that consistently improve performance across
the different algorithms. The reliability class of the clue instance (RELIABILITY-CLASS)
improves accuracy over the baseline for all four algorithms. It is the only feature that
does so. The RELCLASS-MOD features give improvements for all metrics for BoosTexter,
Ripper, and TiMBL, as well as improving polar F-measure for SVM. The PARTS-OF-
SPEECH features are also fairly consistent, improving performance for all the algorithms
except for SVM. There are also a couple of feature sets that consistently do not improve
performance for any of the algorithms: the INTENSIFY and PRECEDED-POS features.
8.2 Polarity Classification
For the second step of recognizing contextual polarity, we classify the polarity of all clue
instances identified as polar in step one. The features for polarity classification were
listed in Table 9 and described in Section 7.2.
We investigate the performance of the polarity features under two conditions:
(1) perfect neutral?polar recognition and (2) automatic neutral?polar recognition. For
condition 1, we identify the polar instances according to the gold-standard, manual
contextual-polarity annotations. In the test data, 9,835 instances of the clues from the
lexicon are polar in context according to the manual annotations. Experiments under
condition 1 classify these instances as having positive, negative, or both (positive and
negative) polarity. For condition 2, we take the best performing neutral?polar classifier
for each algorithm and use the output from those algorithms to identify the polar
instances. Because polar instances now are being identified automatically, there will be
noise in the form of misclassified neutral instances. Therefore, for experiments under
condition 2 we include the neutral class and perform four-way classification instead of
three-way. Condition 1 allows us to investigate the performance of the different polarity
features without the noise of misclassified neutral instances. Also, because the set of
polar instances being classified is the same for all the algorithms, condition 1 allows
us to compare the performance of the polarity features across the different algorithms.
However, condition 2 is themore natural one. It allows us to see how the noise of neutral
instances affects the performance of the polarity features.
The following sections describe three sets of experiments. First, we investigate the
performance of the polarity features used together for polarity classification under
condition 1. As before, the word and word+priorpol classifiers provide our baselines. In
the second set of experiments, we explore the performance of different sets of features
for polarity classification, again assuming perfect recognition of the polar instances.
Finally, we experiment with polarity classification using all the polarity features under
condition 2, automatic recognition of the polar instances.
As before, we use the development data to select the parameter settings for each al-
gorithm. The settings for polarity classification are given in Table 14. They were selected
based on the performance of the word+priorpol baseline classifier under condition 2.
8.2.1 Classification Results: Condition 1. The results for polarity classification using all the
polarity features, assuming perfect neutral?polar recognition for step one, are given in
Table 15. For each algorithm, we give the results for the two baseline classifiers, followed
by the results for the classifier trained using all the polarity features. For the metrics
where the polarity features perform statistically better than both baselines (two-sided
t-test, p ? 0.05), the results are given in bold.

Howwell do the polarity features perform working all together? For all algorithms,
the polarity classifier using all the features significantly outperforms both baselines
in terms of accuracy, positive F-measure, and negative F-measure. These consistent
improvements in performance across all four algorithms show that these features are
quite useful for polarity classification.
One interesting thing that Table 15 reveals is that negative polarity words are much
more straightforward to recognize than positive polarity words, at least in this corpus.
For the negative class, precisions and recalls for the word+priorpol baseline range from
82.2 to 87.2. For the positive class, precisions and recalls for the word+priorpol baseline
range from 63.7 to 76.7. However, it is with the positive class that polarity features seem
to help themost. With the addition of the polarity features, positive F-measure improves
by 5 points on average; improvements in negative F-measures average only 2.75 points.
8.2.2 Feature Set Evaluation. To evaluate the performance of the various features for
polarity classification, we again perform a series of ablation experiments. As before, we
start with the word+priorpol baseline classifier, add different sets of polarity features,
train new classifiers, and compare the results of the new classifiers to the baseline.

Table 16 lists the sets of features tested in each experiment, and Table 17 shows the
results of the experiments. Results are reported as they were previously in Section 8.1.2,
with increases and decreases compared to the baseline for a given metric indicated by +
or ?, respectively.
Looking at Table 17, we see that all three sets of polarity features help to increase
performance as measured by accuracy and positive and negative F-measures. This is
true for all the classification algorithms. As we might expect, including the negation
features has the most marked effect on the performance of polarity classification, with
statistically significant improvements for most metrics across all the algorithms.9 The
9 Although the negation features give the best performance improvements of the three feature sets, these
classifiers still do not perform as well as the respective all-feature polarity classifiers for each algorithm.
422
Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann Recognizing Contextual Polarity
polarity-modification features also seem to be important for polarity classification,
in particular for disambiguating the positive instances. For all the algorithms except
TiMBL, including the polarity-modification features results in significant improvements
for at least one of the positive metrics. The polarity shifters also help classification, but
they seem to be the weakest of the features: Including them does not result in significant
improvements for any algorithm.
Another question that is interesting to consider is how much the word token feature
contributes to polarity classification, given all the other polarity features. Is it enough
to know the prior polarity of a word, whether it is being negated, and how it is related
to other polarity influencers? To answer this question, we train classifiers using all the
polarity features except for word token. Table 18 gives the results for these classifiers;
for comparison, the results for the all-feature polarity classifiers are also given. Inter-
estingly, excluding the word token feature produces only small changes in the overall
results. The results for BoosTexter and Ripper are slightly lower, and the results for
SVM are practically unchanged. TiMBL actually shows a slight improvement, with the
exception of the both class. This provides further evidence of the strength of the polarity
features. Also, a classifier not tied to actual word tokens may potentially be a more
domain-independent classifier.
8.2.3 Classification Results: Condition 2. The experiments in Section 8.2.1 show that the
polarity features perform well under the ideal condition of perfect recognition of polar
instances. The next question to consider is how well the polarity features perform
under the more natural but less-than-perfect condition of automatic recognition of
polar instances. To investigate this, the polarity classifiers (including the baselines) for
each algorithm in these experiments start with the polar instances identified by the
best performing neutral?polar classifier for that algorithm (from Section 8.1.1). The
results for these experiments are given in Table 19. As before, statistically significant
improvements over both baselines are given in bold.
How well do the polarity features perform in the presence of noise from misclas-
sified neutral instances? Our first observation comes from comparing Table 15 with
Table 19: Polarity classification results are much lower for all classifiers with the noise
of neutral instances. Yet in spite of this, the polarity features still produce classifiers that

outperform the baselines. For three of the four algorithms, the classifier using all the
polarity features has the highest accuracy. For BoosTexter and TiMBL, the improvements
in accuracy over both baselines are significant. Also for all algorithms, using the polarity
features gives the highest positive and negative F-measures.
Because the set of polarity instances being classified by each algorithm is different,
we cannot directly compare the results from one algorithm to the next.
8.3 Two-step versus One-step Recognition of Contextual Polarity
Although the two-step approach to recognizing contextual polarity allows us to focus
our investigation on the performance of features for both neutral?polar classification
and polarity classification, the question remains: How does the two-step approach
compare to recognizing contextual polarity in a single classification step? The results
shown in Table 20 help to answer this question. The first row in Table 20 for each
algorithm shows the combined result for the two stages of classification. For BoosTexter,
TiMBL, and Ripper, this is the combination of results from using all the neutral?polar
features for step one, together with the results from using all of the polarity features for
step two.10 For SVM, this is the combination of results from the word+priorpol baseline
from step one, together with results for using all the polarity features for step two.
Recall that the word+priorpol classifier was the best neutral?polar classifier for SVM
(see Table 11). The second rows for BoosTexter, TiMBL, and Ripper show the results of
a single classifier trained to recognize contextual polarity using all the neutral?polar
and polarity features together. For SVM, the second row shows the results of classifying
the contextual polarity using just the word token feature. This classifier outperformed
all others for SVM. In the table, the best result for each metric for each algorithm is
highlighted in bold.
When comparing the two-step and one-step approaches, contrary to our expecta-
tions, we see that the one-step approach performs about as well or better than the
two-step approach for recognizing contextual polarity. For SVM, the improvement in
accuracy achieved by the two-step approach is significant, but this is not true for
the other algorithms. One fairly consistent difference between the two approaches is
that the two-step approach scores slightly higher for neutral F-measure, and the one-
step approach achieves higher F-measures for the polarity classes. The difference in
negative F-measure is significant for BoosTexter, TiMBL, and Ripper. The exception to
this is SVM. For SVM, the two-step approach achieves significantly higher positive and
negative F-measures.
One last question we consider is how much the neutral?polar features contribute
to the performance of the one-step classifiers. The third line in Table 20 for BoosTexter,
TiMBL, and Ripper gives the results for a one-step classifier trainedwithout the neutral?
polar features. Although the differences are not always large, excluding the neutral?
polar features consistently degrades performance in terms of accuracy and positive,
negative, and neutral F-measures. The drop in negative F-measure is significant for all
three algorithms, the drop in neutral F-measure is significant for BoosTexter and TiMBL,
and the drop in accuracy is significant for TiMBL and Ripper (and for BoosTexter at the
p ? 0.1 level).
10 To clarify, Section 8.2.3 only reported results for instances identified as polar in step one. Here, we report
results for all clue instances, including the instances classified as neutral in step one.

The modest drop in performance that we see when excluding the neutral?polar
features in the one-step approach seems to suggest that discriminating between neutral
and polar instances is helpful but not necessarily crucial. However, consider Figure 3.
In this figure, we show the F-measures for the positive, negative, and both classes for
the BoosTexter polarity classifier that uses the gold-standard neutral/polar instances
(from Table 15) and for the BoosTexter one-step polarity classifier that uses all features
(from Table 20). Plotting the same sets of results for the other three algorithms produces
very similar figures. The difference when the classifiers have to contend with the noise
from neutral instances is dramatic. Although Table 20 shows that there is room for
improvement across all the contextual polarity classes, Figure 3 shows us that perhaps
the best way to achieve these improvements is to improve the ability to discriminate the
neutral class from the others.

9. Related Work
9.1 Phrase-Level Sentiment Analysis
Other researchers who have worked on classifying the contextual polarity of sentiment
expressions are Yi et al (2003), Popescu and Etzioni (2005), and Suzuki, Takamura, and
Okumura (2006). Yi et al use a lexicon and manually developed patterns to classify
contextual polarity. Their patterns are high-quality, yielding quite high precision over
the set of expressions that they evaluate. Popescu and Etzioni use an unsupervised clas-
sification technique called relaxation labeling (Hummel and Zucker 1983) to recognize
the contextual polarity of words that are at the heads of select opinion phrases. They
take an iterative approach, using relaxation labeling first to determine the contextual
polarities of the words, then again to label the polarities of the words with respect to
their targets. A third stage of relaxation labeling then is used to assign final polarities to
the words, taking into consideration the presence of other polarity terms and negation.
Aswe do, Popescu and Etzioni use features that represent conjunctions and dependency
relations between polarity words. Suzuki et al use a bootstrapping approach to classify
the polarity of tuples of adjectives and their target nouns in Japanese blogs. Included
in the features that they use are the words that modify the adjectives and the word that
the adjective modifies. They consider the effect of a single negation term, the Japanese
equivalent of not.
Our work in recognizing contextual polarity differs from this research on
expression-level sentiment analysis in several ways. First, the set of expressions they
evaluate is limited either to those that target specific items of interest, such as products
and product features, or to tuples of adjectives and nouns. In contrast, we seek to classify
the contextual polarity of all instances of words from a large lexicon of subjectivity clues
that appear in the corpus. Included in the lexicon are not only adjectives, but nouns,
verbs, adverbs, and even modals.
Our work also differs from other research in the variety of features that we use. As
other researchers do, we consider negation and the words that directly modify or are
modified by the expression being classified. However, with negation, we have features
for both local and longer-distance types of negation, and we take care to count negation
terms only when they are actually being used to negate, excluding, for example, nega-
tion terms when they are used in phrases that intensify (e.g., not only). We also include
contextual features to capture the presence of other clue instances in the surrounding
sentences, and features that represent the reliability of clues from the lexicon.
Finally, a unique aspect of the work presented in this article is the evaluation of
different features for recognizing contextual polarity. We first presented the features
explored in this research in Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffman (2005), but this work signif-
icantly extends that initial evaluation. We explore the performance of features across
different learning algorithms, and we evaluate not only features for discriminating
between positive and negative polarity, but features for determining when a word is
or is not expressing a sentiment in the first place (neutral in context). This is also the
first work to evaluate the effect of neutral instances on the performance of features for
discriminating between positive and negative contextual polarity.
9.2 Other Research in Sentiment Analysis
Recognizing contextual polarity is just one facet of the research in automatic senti-
ment analysis. Research ranges from work on learning the prior polarity (semantic
427
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 3
orientation) of words and phrases (e.g., Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997; Kamps
and Marx 2002; Turney and Littman 2003; Hu and Liu 2004; Kim and Hovy 2004; Esuli
and Sebastiani 2005; Takamura, Inui, and Okumura 2005; Popescu and Etzioni 2005;
Andreevskaia and Bergler 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani 2006a; Kanayama and Nasukawa
2006) to characterizing the sentiment of documents, such as recognizing inflammatory
messages (Spertus 1997), tracking sentiment over time in online discussions (Tong
2001), and classifying the sentiment of online messages (e.g., Das and Chen 2001;
Koppel and Schler 2006), customer feedback data (Gamon 2004), or product and movie
reviews (e.g., Turney 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Dave, Lawrence, and
Pennock 2003; Beineke, Hastie, and Vaithyanathan 2004; Mullen and Collier 2004; Bai,
Padman, and Airoldi 2005; Whitelaw, Garg, and Argamon 2005; Kennedy and Inkpen
2006; Koppel and Schler 2006).
Identifying prior polarity is a different task than recognizing contextual polarity,
although the two tasks are complementary. The goal of identifying prior polarity is
to automatically acquire the polarity of words or phrases for listing in a lexicon. Our
work on recognizing contextual polarity begins with a lexicon of words with established
prior polarities and then disambiguates in the corpus the polarity being expressed
by the phrases in which instances of those words appear. To make the relationship
between that task and ours clearer, someword lists that are used to evaluatemethods for
recognizing prior polarity (positive and negative word lists from the General Inquirer
[Stone et al 1966] and lists of positive and negative adjectives created for evaluation by
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown [1997]) are included in the prior-polarity lexicon used
in our experiments.
For the most part, the features explored in this work differ from the ones used to
identify prior polarity with just a few exceptions. Using a feature to capture conjunc-
tions between clue instances was motivated in part by the work of Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown (1997). They use constraints on the co-occurrence in conjunctions of words
with similar or opposite polarity to predict the prior polarity of adjectives. Esuli and
Sebastiani (2005) consider negation in some of their experiments involving WordNet
glosses. Takamura et al (2005) use negation words and phrases, including phrases such
as lack of that are members in our lists of polarity shifters, and conjunctive expressions
that they collect from corpora.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006a) is the only work in prior-polarity identification to
include a neutral (objective) category and to consider a three-way classification between
positive, negative, and neutral words. Although identifying prior polarity is a different
task, they report a finding similar to ours, namely, that accuracy is lower when neutral
words are included.
Some research in sentiment analysis classifies the sentiments of sentences. Morinaga
et al (2002), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Kim and Hovy (2004), Hu and Liu (2004),
and Grefenstette et al (2004)11 all begin by first creating prior-polarity lexicons. Yu and
Hatzivassiloglou then assign a sentiment to a sentence by averaging the prior semantic
orientations of instances of lexicon words in the sentence. Thus, they do not identify the
contextual polarity of individual phrases containing clue instances, which is the focus
of this work. Morinaga et al only consider the positive or negative clue instance in
each sentence that is closest to some target reference; Kim and Hovy, Hu and Liu, and
Grefenstette et al multiply or count the prior polarities of clue instances in the sentence.
11 In Grefenstette et al (2004), the units that are classified are fixed windows around named entities rather
than sentences.
428
Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann Recognizing Contextual Polarity
These researchers also consider local negation to reverse polarity, with Morinaga et al
also taking into account the negating effect of words like insufficient. However, they
do not use the other types of features that we consider in our experiments. Kaji and
Kitsuregawa (2006) take a different approach to recognizing positive and negative
sentences. They bootstrap from information easily obtained in ?Pro? and ?Con?
HTML tables and lists, and from one high-precision linguistic pattern, to automatically
construct a large corpus of positive and negative sentences. They then use this corpus to
train a naive Bayes sentence classifier. In contrast to our work, sentiment classification
in all of this research is restricted to identifying only positive and negative sentences
(excluding our both and neutral categories). In addition, only one sentiment is assigned
per sentence; our system assigns contextual polarity to individual expressions, which
would allow for a sentence to be assigned to multiple sentiment categories. As we saw
when exploring the contextual polarity annotations, it is not uncommon for sentences
to contain more than one sentiment expression.
Classifying the sentiment of documents is a very different task than recognizing
the contextual polarity of words and phrases. However, some researchers have re-
ported findings about document-level classification that are similar to our findings
about phrase-level classification. Bai et al (2005) argue that dependencies among key
sentiment terms are important for classifying document sentiment. Similarly, we show
that features for capturing when clue instances modify each other are important for
phrase-level classification, in particular, for identifying positive expressions. Gamon
(2004) achieves his best results for document classification using a wide variety of
features, including rich linguistic features, such as features that capture constituent
structure, features that combine part-of-speech and semantic relations (e.g., sentence
subject or negated context), and features that capture tense information. We also achieve
our best results for phrase-level classification using a wide variety of features, many
of which are linguistically rich. Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) report consistently higher
results for document sentiment classification when select polarity influencers, including
negators and intensifiers, are included.12 Koppel and Schler (2006) demonstrate the
importance of neutral examples for document-level classification. In this work, we show
that being able to correctly identify neutral instances is also very important for phrase-
level sentiment analysis.
10. Conclusions and Future Work
Being able to determine automatically the contextual polarity of words and phrases is
an important problem in sentiment analysis. In the research presented in this article, we
tackle this problem and show that it is much more complex than simply determining
whether a word or phrase is positive or negative. In our analysis of a corpus with
annotations of subjective expressions and their contextual polarity, we find that positive
and negative words from a lexicon are used in neutral contexts much more often than
they are used in expressions of the opposite polarity. The importance of identifying
12 Das and Chen (2001), Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan (2002), and Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock (2003) also
represent negation. In their experiments, words which follow a negation term are tagged with a negation
marker and then treated as new words. Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan report that representing negation in
this way slightly helps their results, whereas Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock report a slightly detrimental
effect. Whitelaw, Garg, and Argamon (2005) also represent negation terms and intensifiers. However, in
their experiments, the effect of negation is not separately evaluated, and intensifiers are not found to be
beneficial.
429
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 3
when contextual polarity is neutral is further revealed in our classification experiments:
When neutral instances are excluded, the performance of features for distinguishing
between positive and negative polarity greatly improves.
A focus of this research is on understanding which features are important for
recognizing contextual polarity. We experiment with a wide variety of linguistically
motivated features, and we evaluate the performance of these features using several
different machine learning algorithms. Features for distinguishing between neutral and
polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive
and negative contextual polarity. For classifying neutral and polar instances, we find
that, although some features produce significant improvements over the baseline in
terms of polar or neutral recall or precision, it is the combination of features together
that is needed to achieve significant improvements in accuracy. For classifying positive
and negative contextual polarity, features for capturing negation prove to be the most
important. However, we find that features that also perform well are those that cap-
ture when a word is (or is not) modifying or being modified by other polarity terms.
This suggests that identifying features that represent more complex interdependencies
between polarity clues will be an important avenue for future research.
Another direction for future work will be to expand our lexicon using existing
techniques for acquiring the prior polarity of words and phrases. It follows that a larger
lexicon will have a greater coverage of sentiment expressions. However, expanding the
lexicon with automatically acquired prior-polarity tags may result in an even greater
proportion of neutral instances to contend with. Given the degradation in performance
created by the neutral instances, whether expanding the lexicon automatically will
result in improved performance for recognizing contextual polarity is an empirical
question.
Finally, the overall goal of our research is to use phrase-level sentiment analysis in
higher-level NLP tasks, such as opinion question answering and summarization.

Abstract 
This paper applies the categories from an 
opinion annotation scheme developed for 
monologue text to the genre of multiparty 
meetings. We describe modifications to 
the coding guidelines that were required 
to extend the categories to the new type 
of data, and present the results of an in-
ter-annotator agreement study. As re-
searchers have found with other types of 
annotations in speech data, inter-
annotator agreement is higher when the 
annotators both read and listen to the data 
than when they only read the transcripts.   
Previous work exploited prosodic clues 
to perform automatic detection of speaker 
emotion (Liscombe et al 2003). Our 
findings suggest that doing so to recog-
nize opinion categories would be a prom-
ising line of work. 
1 Introduction 
Subjectivity refers to aspects of language that 
express opinions, beliefs, evaluations and specu-
lations (Wiebe et al 2005).  Many natural lan-
guage processing applications could benefit from 
being able to distinguish between facts and opin-
ions of various types, including speech-oriented 
applications such as meeting browsers, meeting 
summarizers, and speech-oriented question an-
swering (QA) systems. Meeting browsers could 
find instances in meetings where opinions about 
key topics are expressed. Summarizers could in-
clude strong arguments for and against issues, to 
make the final outcome of the meeting more un-
derstandable.  A preliminary user survey 
(Lisowska 2003) showed that users would like to 
be able to query meeting records with subjective 
questions like ?Show me the conflicts of opin-
ions between X and Y? , ?Who made the highest 
number of positive/negative comments? and 
?Give me all the contributions of participant X in 
favor of alternative A regarding the issue I.?  A 
QA system with a component to recognize opin-
ions would be able to help find answers to such 
questions. 
Consider the following example from a meet-
ing about an investment firm choosing which car 
to buy1. (In the examples, the words and phrases 
describing or expressing the opinion are under-
lined): 
(1)2 OCK: Revenues of less 
than a million and losses of 
like five million you know 
that's pathetic 
Here, the speaker, OCK, shows his strong nega-
tive evaluation by using the expression ?That?s 
pathetic.? 
(2) OCK: No it might just be 
a piece of junk cheap piece 
of junk that's not a good 
investment 
In (2), the speaker uses the term ?just a piece of 
junk? to express his negative evaluation and uses 
this to argue for his belief that it is ?not a good 
investment.? 
(3) OCK: Yeah I think that's 
the wrong image for an in-
vestment bank he wants sta-
bility and s safety and you 
don't want flashy like zip-
                                                 
1 Throughout this paper we take examples from a meeting 
where a group of people are deciding on a new car for an 
investment bank. The management wants to attract younger 
investors with a sporty car.  
2 We have presented the examples the way they were ut-
tered by the speaker. Hence they may show many false 
starts and repetitions. Capitalization was added to improve 
readability. 
54
ping around the corner kind 
of thing you know 
The example above shows that the speaker has a 
negative judgment towards the suggestion of a 
sports car (that was made in the previous turn) 
which is indicated by the words ?wrong image.? 
The speaker then goes on to positively argue for 
what he wants. He further argues against the cur-
rent suggestion by using more negative terms 
like ?flashy? and ?zipping around the corner.? 
The speaker believes that ?zipping around the 
corner? is bad as it would give a wrong impres-
sion of the bank to the customers. In the absence 
of such analyses, the decision making process 
and rationale behind the outcomes of meetings, 
which form an important part of the organiza-
tion?s memory, might remain unavailable. 
In this paper, we perform annotation of a 
meeting corpus to lay the foundation for research 
on opinion detection in speech. We show how 
categories from an opinion (subjectivity) annota-
tion scheme, which was developed for news arti-
cles, can be applied to the genre of multi-party 
meetings. The new genre poses challenges as it is 
significantly different from the text domain, 
where opinion analysis has traditionally been 
applied. Specifically, differences arise because:  
1) There are many participants interacting with 
one another, each expressing his or her own 
opinion, and eliciting reactions in the process. 
2) Social interactions may constrain how openly 
people express their opinions; i.e., they are often 
indirect in their negative evaluations. 
We also  explore the influence of speech on hu-
man perception of opinions.  
Specifically, we annotated some meeting data 
with the opinion categories Sentiment and Argu-
ing as defined in Wilson and Wiebe (2005). In 
our annotation we first distinguish whether a 
Sentiment or Arguing is being expressed. If one 
is, we then mark the polarity (i.e., positive or 
negative) and the intensity (i.e., how strong the 
opinion is). Annotating the individual opinion 
expressions is useful in this genre, because we 
see many utterances that have more than one 
type of opinion (e.g. (3) above). To investigate 
how opinions are expressed in speech, we divide 
our annotation into two tasks, one in which the 
annotator only reads the raw text, and the other 
in which the annotator reads the raw text and also 
listens to the speech. We measure inter-annotator 
agreement for both tasks.  
We found that the opinion categories apply 
well to the multi-party meeting data, although 
there is some room for improvement: the Kappa 
values range from 0.32 to 0.69.  As has been 
found for other types of annotations in speech, 
agreement is higher when the annotators both 
read and listen to the data than when they only 
read the transcripts. Interestingly, the advantages 
are more dramatic for some categories than oth-
ers.  And, in both conditions, agreement is higher 
for the positive than for the negative categories.  
We discuss possible reasons for these disparities. 
Prosodic clues have been exploited to perform 
automatic detection of speaker emotion (Lis-
combe et al 2003).  Our findings suggest that 
doing so to recognize opinion categories is a 
promising line of work.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
In Section 2 we discuss the data and the annota-
tion scheme and present examples. We then pre-
sent our inter-annotator agreement results in Sec-
tion 3, and in Section 4 we discuss issues and 
observations. Related work is described in Sec-
tion 5. Conclusions and Future Work are pre-
sented in Section 6. 
2 Annotation  
2.1 Data 
The data is from the ISL meeting corpus (Bur-
ger et al 2002).  We chose task oriented meet-
ings from the games/scenario and discussion 
genres, as we felt they would be closest to the 
applications for which the opinion analysis will 
be useful. The ISL speech is accompanied by 
rich transcriptions, which are tagged according to 
VERBMOBIL conventions. However, since real-
time applications only have access to ASR out-
put, we gave the annotators raw text, from which 
all VERBMOBIL tags, punctuation, and capitali-
zations were removed.  
In order to see how annotations would be af-
fected by the presence or absence of speech, we 
divided each raw text document into 2 segments. 
One part was annotated while reading the raw 
text only. For the annotation of the other part, 
speech as well as the raw text was provided.   
2.2 Opinion Category Definitions  
We base our annotation definitions on the 
scheme developed by Wiebe et al (2005) for 
news articles. That scheme centers on the notion 
of subjectivity, the linguistic expression of pri-
vate states. Private states are internal mental 
states that cannot be objectively observed or veri-
fied (Quirk et al 1985) and include opinions, 
beliefs, judgments, evaluations, thoughts, and 
feelings. Amongst these many forms of subjec-
55
tivity, we focus on the Sentiment and Arguing 
categories proposed by Wilson and Wiebe 
(2005). The categories are broken down by po-
larity and defined as follows:  
Positive Sentiments: positive emotions, 
evaluations, judgments and stances. 
(4) TBC: Well ca How about 
one of the the newer Cadil-
lac the Lexus is good 
In (4), taken from the discussion of which car to 
buy, the speaker uses the term ?good? to express 
his positive evaluation of the Lexus . 
Negative Sentiments: negative emotions, 
evaluations, judgments and stances. 
(5) OCK: I think these are 
all really bad choices 
In (5), the speaker expresses his negative evalua-
tion of the choices for the company car. Note that 
?really? makes the evaluation more intense.  
Positive Arguing:  arguing for something, ar-
guing that something is true or is so, arguing that 
something did happen or will happen, etc. 
(6) ZDN: Yeah definitely 
moon roof  
In (6), the speaker is arguing that whatever car 
they get should have a moon roof. 
Negative Arguing: arguing against some-
thing, arguing that something is not true or is not 
so, arguing that something did not happen or will 
not happen, etc. 
(7) OCK: Like a Lexus or 
perhaps a Stretch Lexus 
something like that but that 
might be too a little too 
luxurious 
In the above example, the speaker is using the 
term ?a little too luxurious? to argue against a 
Lexus for the car choice.  
In an initial tagging experiment, we applied 
the above definitions, without modification, to 
some sample meeting data. The definitions cov-
ered much of the arguing and sentiment we ob-
served. However, we felt that some cases of Ar-
guing that are more prevalent in meeting than in 
news data needed to be highlighted more, namely 
Arguing opinions that are implicit or that under-
lie what is explicitly said. Thus we add the fol-
lowing to the arguing definitions. 
Positive Arguing: expressing support for or 
backing the acceptance of an object, viewpoint, 
idea or stance by providing reasoning, justifica-
tions, judgment, evaluations or beliefs. This sup-
port or backing may be explicit or implicit. 
(8) MHJ: That's That's why I 
wanna What about the the 
child safety locks I think I 
think that would be a good 
thing because if our custom-
ers happen to have children  
Example (8) is marked as both Positive Arguing 
and Positive Sentiment. The more explicit one is 
the Positive Sentiment that the locks are good. 
The underlying Argument is that the company 
car they choose should have child safety locks. 
Negative Arguing: expressing lack of support 
for or attacking the acceptance of an object, 
viewpoint, idea or stance by providing reasoning, 
justifications, judgment, evaluations or beliefs. 
This may be explicit or implicit. 
(9) OCK: Town Car But it's a 
little a It's a little like 
your grandf Yeah your grand-
father would drive that 
Example (9) is explicitly stating who would drive 
a Town Car, while implicitly arguing against 
choosing the Town Car (as they want younger 
investors). 
2.3 Annotation Guidelines 
Due to genre differences, we also needed to 
modify the annotation guidelines. For each Argu-
ing or Sentiment the annotator perceives, he or 
she identifies the words or phrases used to ex-
press it (the text span), and then creates an anno-
tation consisting of the following. 
? Opinion Category and Polarity 
? Opinion Intensity 
? Annotator Certainty 
Opinion Category and Polarity: These are 
defined in the previous sub-section. Note that the 
target of an opinion is what the opinion is about. 
For example, the target of ?John loves baseball? 
is baseball.   An opinion may or may not have a 
separate target.  For example, ?want stability? in 
?We want stability? denotes a Positive Senti-
ment, and there is no separate target.  In contrast, 
?good? in ?The Lexus is good? expresses a Posi-
tive Sentiment and there is a separate target, 
namely the Lexus. 
In addition to Sentiments toward a topic of 
discussion, we also mark Sentiments toward 
other team members (e.g. ?Man you guys 
are so limited?). We do not mark 
agreements or disagreements as Sentiments, as 
these are different dialog acts (though they some-
times co-occur with Sentiments and Arguing).  
Intensity: We use a slightly modified version 
of Craggs and Wood's (2004) emotion intensity 
56
annotation scheme. According to that scheme, 
there are 5 levels of intensity. Level ?0? denotes 
a lack of the emotion (Sentiment or Arguing in 
our case), ?1? denotes traces of emotion, ?2? de-
notes a low level of emotion, ?3? denotes a clear 
expression while ?4? denotes a strong expres-
sion. Our intensity levels mean the same, but we 
do not mark intensity level 0 as this level implies 
the absence of opinion. 
If a turn has multiple, separate expressions 
marked with the same opinion tag (category and 
polarity), and all expressions refer to the same 
target, then the annotators merge all the expres-
sions into a larger text span, including the sepa-
rating text in between the  expressions. This re-
sulting text span has the same opinion tag as its 
constituents, and it has an intensity that is greater 
than or equal to the highest intensity of the con-
stituent expressions that were merged. 
Annotator Certainty: The annotators use this 
tag if they are not sure that a given opinion is 
present, or if, given the context, there are multi-
ple possible interpretations of the utterance and 
the annotator is not sure which interpretation is 
correct. This attribute is distinct from the Inten-
sity attribute, because the Intensity attribute indi-
cates the strength of the opinion, while the Anno-
tator Certainty attribute indicates whether the 
annotator is sure about a given tag (whatever the 
intensity is). 
2.4 Examples 
We conclude this section with some examples 
of annotations from our corpus.  
(10) OCK: So Lexun had reve-
nues of a hundred and fifty 
million last year and prof-
its of like six million.  
That's pretty good 
Annotation: Text span=That's 
pretty good Cate-
gory=Positive Sentiment In-
tensity=3 Annotator Cer-
tainty=Certain  
The annotator marked the text span ?That?s 
pretty good? as Positive Sentiment because this 
this expression is used by OCK to show his fa-
vorable judgment towards the company reve-
nues. The intensity is 3, as it is a clear expression 
of Sentiment.  
(11) OCK: No it might just 
be a piece of junk Cheap 
piece of junk that?s not a 
good investment 
Annotation1: Text span=it 
might just be a piece of 
junk Cheap piece of junk 
that?s not a good investment 
Category=Negative Sentiment 
Intensity=4 Annotator Cer-
tainty=Certain 
Annotation2: Text span=Cheap 
piece of junk that?s not a 
good investment Category 
=Negative Arguing Inten-
sity=3 Annotator Certainty 
=Certain  
In the above example, there are multiple expres-
sions of opinions. In Annotation1, the expres-
sions ?it might just be a piece of junk?, ?cheap 
piece of junk? and ?not a good investment? ex-
press negative evaluations towards the car choice 
(suggested by another participant in a previous 
turn). Each of these expressions is a clear case of 
Negative Sentiment (Intensity=3). As they are all 
of the same category and polarity and towards 
the same target, they have been merged by the 
annotator into one long expression of Inten-
sity=4. In Annotation2, the sub-expression 
?cheap piece of junk that is not a good invest-
ment? is also used by the speaker OCK to argue 
against the car choice. Hence the annotator has 
marked this as Negative Arguing.  
3 Guideline Development and Inter-
Annotator Agreement 
3.1 Annotator Training 
Two annotators (both co-authors) underwent 
three rounds of tagging. After each round, dis-
crepancies were discussed, and the guidelines 
were modified to reflect the resolved ambiguities. 
A total of 1266 utterances belonging to sections 
of four meetings (two of the discussion genre and 
two of the game genre) were used in this phase. 
3.2 Agreement  
The unit for which agreement was calculated 
was the turn. The ISL transcript provides demar-
cation of speaker turns along with the speaker ID. 
If an expression is marked in a turn, the turn is 
assigned the label of that expression. If there are 
multiple expressions marked within a turn with 
different category tags, the turn is assigned all 
those categories. This does not pose a problem 
for our evaluation, as we evaluate each category 
separately. 
A previously unseen section of a meeting con-
taining 639 utterances was selected and divided 
57
into 2 segments. One part of 319 utterances was 
annotated using raw text as the only signal, and 
the remaining 320 utterances were annotated us-
ing text and speech. Cohen?s Kappa (1960) was 
used to calculate inter-annotator agreement. We 
calculated inter-annotator agreement for both 
conditions: raw-text-only and raw-text+speech. 
This was done for each of the categories: Posi-
tive Sentiment, Positive Arguing, Negative Sen-
timent, and Negative Arguing. To evaluate a 
category, we did the following:  
? For each turn, if both annotators tagged 
the turn with the given category, or both 
did not tag the turn with the category, then 
it is a match.  
? Otherwise it is a mismatch 
Table 1 shows the inter-annotator Kappa val-
ues on the test set. 
 
Agreement (Kappa) Raw Text only 
Raw Text 
+ Speech 
Positive Arguing 0.54 0.60 
Negative Arguing 0.32 0.65 
Positive Sentiment 0.57 0.69 
Negative Sentiment 0.41 0.61 
Table 1 Inter-annotator agreement on different 
categories. 
 
With raw-text-only annotation, the Kappa 
value is in the moderate range according to 
Landis and Koch (1977), except for Negative 
Arguing for which it is 0.32. Positive Arguing 
and Positive Sentiment were more reliably de-
tected than Negative Arguing and Negative Sen-
timent. We believe this is because participants 
were more comfortable with directly expressing 
their positive sentiments in front of other partici-
pants.  Given only the raw text data, inter-
annotator reliability measures for Negative Argu-
ing and Negative Sentiment are the lowest. We 
believe this might be due to the fact that partici-
pants in social interactions are not very forthright 
with their Negative Sentiments and Arguing. 
Negative Sentiments and Arguing towards some-
thing may be expressed by saying that something 
else is better. For example, consider the follow-
ing response of one participant to another par-
ticipant?s suggestion of aluminum wheels for the 
company car 
(12) ZDN: Yeah see what kind 
of wheels you know they have 
to look dignified to go with 
the car 
The above example was marked as Negative Ar-
guing by one annotator (i.e., they should not get 
aluminum wheels) while the other annotator did 
not mark it at all. The implied Negative Arguing 
toward getting aluminum wheels can be inferred 
from the statement that the wheels should look 
dignified. However the annotators were not sure, 
as the participant chose to focus on what is desir-
able (i.e., dignified wheels). This utterance is 
actually both a general statement of what is de-
sirable, and an implication that aluminum wheels 
are not dignified. But this may be difficult to as-
certain with the raw text signal only.  
When the annotators had speech to guide their 
judgments, the Kappa values go up significantly 
for each category. All the agreement numbers for 
raw text+speech are in the substantial range ac-
cording to Landis and Koch (1977). We observe 
that with speech, Kappa for Negative Arguing 
has doubled over the Kappa obtained without 
speech. The Kappa for Negative Sentiment 
(text+speech) shows a 1.5 times improvement 
over the one with only raw text. Both these ob-
servations indicate that speech is able to help the 
annotators tag negativity more reliably. It is quite 
likely that a seemingly neutral sentence could 
sound negative, depending on the way words are 
stressed or pauses are inserted. Comparing the 
agreement on Positive Sentiment, we get a 1.2 
times improvement by using speech. Similarly, 
agreement improves by 1.1 times for Positive 
Arguing when speech is used. The improvement 
with speech for the Positive categories is not as 
high as compared to negative categories, which 
conforms to our belief that people are more 
forthcoming about their positive judgments, 
evaluations, and beliefs.  
In order to test if the turns where annotators 
were uncertain were the places that caused mis-
match, we calculated the Kappa with the annota-
tor-uncertain cases removed. The corresponding 
Kappa values are shown in Table 2 
 
Agreement ( Kappa) Raw Text only 
Raw Text 
+ Speech 
Positive Arguing 0.52 0.63 
Negative Arguing 0.36 0.63 
Positive Sentiment 0.60 0.73 
Negative Sentiment 0.50 0.61 
Table-2 Inter-annotator agreement on different 
categories, Annotator Uncertain cases removed. 
 
The trends observed in Table 1 are seen in Ta-
ble 2 as well, namely annotation reliability im-
proving with speech. Comparing Tables 1 and 2, 
58
we see that for the raw text, the inter-annotator 
agreement goes up by 0.04 points for Negative 
Arguing and goes up by 0.09 points for Negative 
Sentiment. However, the agreement for Negative 
Arguing and Negative Sentiment on raw-text+ 
speech between Tables 1 and 2 remains almost 
the same. We believe this is  because we had 
20% fewer Annotator Uncertainty tags in the 
raw-text+speech annotation as compared to raw-
text-only, thus indicating that some types of un-
certainties seen in raw-text-only were resolved in 
the raw-text+speech due to the speech input. The 
remaining cases of Annotator Uncertainty could 
have been due to other factors, as discussed in 
the next section 
Table 3 shows Kappa with the low intensity 
tags removed. The hypothesis was that low in-
tensity might be borderline cases, and that re-
moving these might increase inter-annotator reli-
ability.  
 
Agreement ( Kappa) Raw Text only 
Raw Text 
+ Speech 
Positive Arguing 0.53 0.66 
Negative Arguing 0.26 0.65 
Positive Sentiment 0.65 0.74 
Negative Sentiment 0.45 0.59 
Table-3 Inter-annotator agreement on different 
categories, Intensity 1, 2 removed. 
 
Comparing Tables 1 and 3 (the raw-text col-
umns), we see that there is an improvement in 
the agreement on sentiment (both positive and 
negative) if the low intensity cases are removed.  
The agreement for Negative Sentiment (raw-text) 
goes up marginally by 0.04 points.  Surprisingly, 
the agreement for Negative Arguing (raw-text) 
goes down by 0.06 points. Similarly in raw-
text+speech results, removal of low intensity 
cases does not improve the agreement for Nega-
tive Arguing while hurting Negative Sentiment 
category (by 0.02 points). One possible explana-
tion is that it may be equally difficult to detect 
Negative categories at both low and high intensi-
ties. Recall that in (12) it was difficult to detect if 
there is  Negative Arguing at all. If the annotator 
decided that it is indeed a Negative Arguing, it is 
put at intensity level=3 (i.e., a clear case). 
4 Discussion 
There were a number of interesting subjectiv-
ity related phenomena in meetings that we ob-
served during our annotation. These are issues 
that will need to be addressed for improving in-
ter-annotator reliability. 
Global and local context for arguing: In the 
context of a meeting, participants argue for (posi-
tively) or against (negatively) a topic. This may 
become ambiguous when the participant uses an 
explicit local Positive Arguing and an implicit 
global Negative Arguing. Consider the following 
speaker turn, at a point in the meeting when one 
participant has suggested that the company car 
should have a moon roof and another participant 
has opposed it, by saying that a moon roof would 
compromise the headroom. 
(13) OCK: We wanna make sure 
there's adequate headroom 
for all those six foot six 
investors 
In the above example, the speaker OCK, in the 
local context of the turn, is arguing positively 
that headroom is important. However, in the 
global context of the meeting, he is arguing 
against the idea of a moon roof that was sug-
gested by a participant. Such cases occur when 
one object (or opinion) is endorsed which auto-
matically precludes another, mutually exclusive 
object (or opinion).  
Sarcasm/Humor: The meetings we analyzed 
had a large amount of sarcasm and humor. Issues 
arose with sarcasm due to our approach of mark-
ing opinions towards the content of the meeting 
(which forms the target of the opinion). Sarcasm 
is difficult to annotate because sarcasm can be 
1) On topic: Here the target is the topic of dis-
cussion and hence sarcasm is used as a Negative 
Sentiment. 
2) Off topic: Here the target is not a topic un-
der discussion, and the aim is to purely elicit 
laughter. 
3) Allied topic: In this case, the target is re-
lated to the topic in some way, and it?s difficult 
to determine if the aim of the sarcasm/humor was 
to elicit laughter or to imply something negative 
towards the topic.  
Multiple modalities: In addition to text and 
speech, gestures and visual diagrams play an im-
portant role in some types of meetings. In one 
meeting that we analyzed, participants were 
working together to figure out how to protect an 
egg when it is dropped from a long distance, 
given the materials they have. It was evident they 
were using some gestures to describe their ideas 
(?we can put tape like this?) and that they drew 
diagrams to get points across. In the absence of 
visual input, annotators would need to guess 
59
what was happening. This might further hurt the 
inter-annotator reliability. 
5 Related Work  
Our opinion categories are from the subjectiv-
ity schemes described in Wiebe et al (2005) and 
Wilson and Wiebe (2005). Wiebe et al (2005) 
perform expression level annotation of opinions 
and subjectivity in text. They define their annota-
tions as an experiencer having some type of atti-
tude (such as Sentiment or Arguing), of a certain 
intensity, towards a target. Wilson and Wiebe 
(2005) extend this basic annotation scheme to 
include different types of subjectivity, including 
Positive Sentiment, Negative Sentiment, Positive 
Arguing, and Negative Arguing. 
Speech was found to improve inter-annotator 
agreement in discourse segmentation of mono-
logs (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). Acoustic 
clues have been successfully employed for the 
reliable detection of the speaker?s emotions, in-
cluding frustration, annoyance, anger, happiness, 
sadness, and boredom (Liscombe et al 2003).  
Devillers et al (2003) performed perceptual tests 
with and without speech in detecting the 
speaker?s fear, anger, satisfaction and embar-
rassment.  Though related, our work is not con-
cerned with the speaker?s emotions, but rather 
opinions toward the issues and topics addressed 
in the meeting. 
Most annotation work in multiparty conversa-
tion has focused on exchange structures and dis-
course functional units like common grounding 
(Nakatani and Traum, 1998). In common ground-
ing research, the focus is on whether the partici-
pants of the discourse are able to understand each 
other, and not their opinions towards the content 
of the discourse. Other tagging schemes like the 
one proposed by Flammia and Zue (1997) focus 
on information seeking and question answering 
exchanges where one participant is purely seek-
ing information, while the other is providing it. 
The SWBD DAMSL (Jurafsky et al, 1997) an-
notation scheme over the Switchboard telephonic 
conversation corpus labels shallow discourse 
structures. The SWBD-DAMSL had a label ?sv? 
for opinions. However, due to poor inter-
annotator agreement, the authors discarded these 
annotations. The ICSI MRDA annotation scheme 
(Rajdip et al, 2003) adopts the SWBD DAMSL 
scheme, but does not distinguish between the 
opinionated and objective statements. The ISL 
meeting corpus (Burger and Sloane, 2004) is an-
notated with dialog acts and discourse moves like 
initiation and response, which in turn consist of 
dialog tags such as query, align, and statement. 
Their statement dialog category would not only 
include Sentiment and Arguing tags discussed in 
this paper, but it would also include objective 
statements and other types of subjectivity. 
?Hot spots? in meetings closely relate to our 
work because they find sections in the meeting 
where participants are involved in debates or 
high arousal activity (Wrede and Shriberg 2003). 
While that work distinguishes between high 
arousal and low arousal, it does not distinguish 
between  opinion or non-opinion or the different 
types of opinion. However, Janin et al (2004) 
suggest that there is a relationship between dia-
log acts and involvement, and that involved ut-
terances contain significantly more evaluative 
and subjective statements as well as extremely 
positive or negative answers. Thus we believe it 
may be beneficial for such works to make these 
distinctions. 
Another closely related work that finds par-
ticipants? positions regarding issues is argument 
diagramming (Rienks et al 2005). This ap-
proach, based on the IBIS system (Kunz and Rit-
tel 1970), divides a discourse into issues, and 
finds lines of deliberated arguments. However 
they do not distinguish between subjective and 
objective contributions towards the meeting. 
6 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper we performed an annotation 
study of opinions in meetings, and investigated 
the effects of speech. We have shown that it is 
possible to reliably detect opinions within multi-
party conversations. Our consistently better 
agreement results with text+speech input over 
text-only input suggest that speech is a reliable 
indicator of opinions. We have also found that 
Annotator Uncertainty decreased with speech 
input. Our results also show that speech is a more 
informative indicator for negative versus positive 
categories. We hypothesize that this is due to the 
fact the people express their positive attitudes 
more explicitly. The speech signal is thus even 
more important for discerning negative opinions. 
This experience has also helped us gain insights 
to the ambiguities that arise due to sarcasm and 
humor. 
Our promising results open many new avenues 
for research. It will be interesting to see how our 
categories relate to other discourse structures, 
both at the shallow level (agree-
ment/disagreement) as well as at the deeper level 
60
(intentions/goals). It will also be interesting to 
investigate how other forms of subjectivity like 
speculation and intention are expressed in multi-
party discourse. Finding prosodic correlates of 
speech as well as lexical clues that help in opin-
ion detection would be useful in building subjec-
tivity detection applications for multiparty meet-
ings.
