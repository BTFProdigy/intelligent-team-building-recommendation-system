Abstract 
We present a class-based approach to building a 
verb lexicon that makes explicit the close asso- 
ciation between syntax and semantics for Levin 
classes. We have used Lexicalized Tree Adjoin- 
ing Grammars to capture the syntax associated with 
each verb class and have augmented the trees to in- 
clude selectional restrictions. In addition, semantic 
predicates are associated with each tree, which al- 
low for a colnpositional interpretation. 
1 Introduction 
The difficulty o1' achieving adequate hand-crafted 
semantic representations has limited the lield of 
natural language t)rocessing to applications that 
can be contained within well-deIined sub-domains. 
Despite many different lexicon development ap- 
proaches (Mel'cuk, 1988; Copestakc and Sanfil- 
ippo, 1993; Lowe et al, 1997), the field has yet 
to develop a clear conseusus on guidelines for a 
colnputational lexicon. One of the most controver- 
sial areas in building such a lexicon is polyselny: 
how senses can be computationally distinguished 
and characterized. We address this problem hy em- 
ploying compositional semantics and the adjunction 
of syntactic l)hrases to support regular verb sense 
extensions. This differs l'rom the Lexical Concep- 
tual Structure (LCS) approach exemplified by Voss 
(1996), which requires a separate LCS representa- 
tion for each possible sense extension. In this pa- 
per we describe the construction of VerbNet, a verb 
lexicon with explicitly stated syntactic and seman- 
tic information for individual exical items, using 
Levin verb classes (Levin, 1993) to systematically 
construct lexical entries. We use Lexicalized Tree 
Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Joshi, 1987; Schabes, 
1990) to capture the syntax for each verb class, and 
associate semantic predicates with each tree. 
Althougla similar ideas have been explored for 
w:rb sense extension (Pusteiovsky, 1995; Goldberg, 
1995), our approach of applying LTAG to the prob- 
lem of composing and extending verb senses is 
novel. LTAGs have an extended omain of local- 
ity that captures the arguments of a verb in a local 
manner. The association of semantic predicates to a 
tree yields a complete semantics for the verb. More- 
ovel, the operation of adjunction in LTAGs provides 
a mechanism for extending verb senses. 
2 Levin classes 
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb 
to occur in diathesis alternations, which are pairs 
of syntactic frames that are in some sense meaning 
preserving. The fundalnental ssulnption is that the 
syntactic frames arc a direct reflection of the under- 
lying semantics, ltowever, Levin classes exhibit in- 
consistencies that have hampered researchers' abil- 
ity to reference them directly in applications. Many 
verbs ale listed in multiple classes, some of which 
have confl icting sets of syntactic frames. Dang et al 
(1998) showed that multiple listings could in some 
cases be interpreted as regular sense xtensions, and 
defined intersective Levin classes, which are a more 
line-grained, syntactically and semantically coher- 
ent refinement of basic Levin classes. We represent 
these verb classes and their regular sense xtensions 
in the LTAG forlnalism. 
3 Lexicalized rI?ee Adjoining Grammars 
3.1 Overview of formalism 
Lexicatized Tree Adjoining Granunars consist of a 
finite set of initial and auxiliary elementary hees, 
and two operations to combine them. The min- 
imal, non-recursive linguistic structures of a lan- 
guage, such as a verb and its complements, are cap- 
tured by initial trees. Recursive structures of a lan- 
guage, such as prepositional modifiers which result 
in syntactically embedded VPs, are represented by 
auxiliary trees. 
1011 
Elementary trees are combined by the operations 
of substitution and adjunction. Substitution is a sim- 
ple operation that replaces a leaf of a tree with a new 
tree. Adjunction is a splicing operation that replaces 
an internal node of an elementary tree with an aux- 
iliary tree. Eveu tree is associated with a lexical 
item of the language, called the anchor of the tree. 
Tile tree represents the domain over which the lex- 
ical item can directly specify syntactic onstraints, 
such as subject-verb number agreement, or seman- 
tic constraints, uch as selectional restrictions, all of 
which are implemented as features. 
LTAGs are more powerful than context free gram- 
mars (CFG), allowing localization of so-called un- 
bounded dependencies that cannot be handled by 
CFGs. There are critical benefits to lexical seman- 
tics that are provided by the extended omain of 
locality of the lexicalized trees. Each lexical en- 
try corresponds to a tree. If the lexical item is a 
verb, the conesponding tree is a skeleton for an en- 
tire sentence with the verb already present, anchor- 
ing the tree as a terminal symbol. The other parts 
of the sentence will be substituted or adjoined in at 
appropriate places in the skeleton tree in the course 
of the derivation. The composition of trees during 
parsing is recorded in a derivation tree. The deriva- 
tion tree nodes correspond to lexically anchored el- 
ementary trees, and the arcs are labeled with infor- 
mation about how these trees were combined to pro- 
duce the parse. Since each lexically anchored initial 
tree corresponds to a semantic unit, the derivation 
tree closely resembles a semantic-dependency rep- 
resentation. 
3.2 Semantics for TAGs 
There is a range of previous work in incorporating 
semantics into TAG trees. Stone and Doran (1997) 
describe a system used for generation that simul- 
taneously constructs the semantics and syntax of 
a sentence using LTAGs. Joshi and Vijay-Shanker 
(1999), and Kallmeyer and Joshi (1999), describe 
the semantics of a derivation tree as a set of attach- 
ments of trees. The semantics of these attachments 
is given as a conjunction of formulae in a flat seman- 
tic representation. They provide a specific method- 
ology for composing semantic representations much 
like Candito and Kahane (1998), where the direc- 
tionality of dominance in the derivation tree should 
be interpreted according to the operations used to 
build it. Kallmeyer and Joshi also use a flat semantic 
representation to handle scope phenomena involv- 
ing quantifiers. 
4 Descr ip t ion  of  the verb lexicon 
VerbNet can be viewed in both a static and a dy- 
namic way. Tile static aspect refers to the verb and 
class entries and how they are organized, providing 
the characteristic descriptions of a verb sense or a 
verb class (Kipper et al, 2000). The dynamic as- 
pect of the lexicon constrains the entries to allow 
a compositional interpretation i LTAG derivation 
trees, representing extended verb meanings by in- 
corporating adjuncts. 
Verb classes allow us to capture generalizations 
about verb behavioL Each verb class lists the tlle- 
mafic roles that the predicate-argument structure of 
its members allows, and provides descriptions of 
the syntactic fi'ames conesponding to licensed con- 
structions, with selectional restrictions defined for 
each argument in each frame, l Each frame also 
includes semantic predicates describing the partic- 
ipants at various stages of the event described by 
the frame. 
Verb classes are hierarchically organized, ensur- 
ing that each class is coherent - that is, all its mem- 
bers have common semantic elements and share a 
common set of thematic roles and basic syntactic 
frames. This requires ome manual restructuring of 
the original Levin classes, which is facilitated by us- 
ing intersective Levin classes. 
5 Compositional Semantics 
We use TAG elementary trees for the description 
of allowable frames and associate semantic predi- 
cates with each tree, as was done by Stone and Do- 
ran. The semantic predicates are primitive enough 
so that many may be reused in different rees. By 
using TAGs we get the additional benefit of an ex- 
isting parser that yields derivations and derived trees 
fiom which we can construct the compositional se- 
mantics of a given sentence. 
We decompose each event E into a tripar- 
tite structure in a manner similar to Moens and 
Steedman (1988), introducing a time function for 
each predicate to specify whether the predicate is 
true in the preparatory (d~ring(E)), cuhnination 
(er~d(E)), or consequent (res~ll:(E)) stage of an 
event. 
hfitial trees capture tile semantics of the basic 
senses of verbs in each class. For example, many 
IThese restrictions are more like preferences that generate a 
preferred reading of a sentence. They may be relaxed epend- 
ing on the domain of a particular pplication.

Figure 1 : Induced action alternation for the Run verbs 
verbs in the Run class can occur in the induced ac- 
tion alternation, in which the subject of the inmmsi- 
tive sentence has the same thematic role as the direct 
object in the transitive sentence. Figure l shows the 
initial trees for the transitive and intransitive vari- 
ants for the Run class, along with their semantic 
predicates. The entity in motion is given by argl, 
associated with the syntactic subject of the intransi- 
tive tree and the direct object of the transitive tree. 
The event denoted by the transitive variant is a com- 
position of two subevents: E1 refers to the event of 
av.ql running, and E2 refers to the event of an entity 
(argO) causing event E l .  
Predicates are associated with not only the verb 
trees, but also the auxiliary trees. We use a flat 
semantic rcpmsentatiou like that of Kalhncycr and 
Joshi, and the semantics of a sentence is the con- 
junction of the semantic predicates of the trees used 
to derive the sentence. Figure 2 shows au auxiliary 
tree for a path prepositional pllrase headed by "to", 
along with its associated semantic predicate. 
When the PP tree for "to the park" is adjoiued into 
the intransitive tree for "John ran", the semantic in- 
terpretation is the conjunction of the two predicates 
motion(during(E),john) A goal(end(E),john, park); 
adjunction into the transitive tree for "Bill ran 
the horse" yields cause(during(E2),bilI, El) A mo- 
tion(during(El), horse) A goal(end(El), horse, park). 
In both cases, the argument X,rs?0.,rgl (john or 
horse) for the anxiliary tree is noulocal and colnes 
from the adjunction site. 2 The arguments are re- 
covered from the derivation tree, following Candito 
and Kahane. When an initial tree is substituted into 
another tree, the dependency mirrors the derivation 
structure, so the variables associated with the sub- 
2X.,..qo,.,.ga is the variable associated with the cntity in mo- 
tion (ar91) in the tree to which tile PP a(Uoins (argO). 
stituting tree can be referenced as arguments in the 
host tree's predicates. When an auxiliary tree is 
adjoined, the dependency for the adjunction is re- 
versed, so that variables associated with the host 
tree can be referenced as arguments in the adjoin- 
ing tree's predicates.

The tripartite vent structure allows us to express 
the semantics of classes of verbs like change of 
state verbs whose description requires reference to 
a complex event structure. In the case of a verb 
such as "break", it is important to make a distinc- 
tion between the state of the object before the end 
of the action and the new state that results after- 
wards. This event structure also handles the eona- 
tive construction, in which there is an intention of 
a goal during the event, that is not achieved at 
the end of the event. The example of the cona- 
rive construction shown in Figure 3 expresses the 
intention of hitting something. Because the in- 
tention is not satisfied the semantics do not in- 
clude the predicates manner(end(E),fi~rcefuI, X, rgo ) 
A conmct(end(E),X, rgo,Xc~rgO, that express the 
completion of the contact with impact event.

sudden contact has to be established. By adjoining 
a path PP such as "across NP", we get an extended 
meaning, and a change in Levin class membership 
to the Throw class. Figure 4 shows the class-specific 
auxiliary tree anchored by the preposition "across" 
together with its semantic predicates, introducing a

contact event.

oll the LTAG formalism, for which we already have 
a large English grammar. Palmer et al (1998) de- 
fined compositional semantics for classes of verbs 
implemented in LTAG, representing general seman- 
tic components (e.g., motion, manner) as features 
on the nodes of the trees. Ore" use of separate log- 
ical forms gives a more detailed semantics for the 
sentence, so that for an event involving motion, it is 
possible to know not only that the event has a motion 
semantic omponent, but also which entity is actu- 
ally in motion. This level of detail is necessary for 
applications uch as animatiou of natural anguage 
instructions (Bindiganavale t al., 2000). Another 
important contribution of this work is that by divid- 
ing each event into a tripartite structure, we permit a 
more precise definition of the associated semantics. 
Finally, the operation of adjunction in TAGs pro- 
vides a principled approach to representing the type 
of regular polysemy that has been a major obstacle 
in buildiug verb lexicons. 
Researching whether a TAG grammar for Verb- 
Net can be automatically constructed by using de- 
velopment tools such as Xia et al (1999) or Candito 
(1996) is part of our next step. We also expect o be 
able to factor out some class-specific auxiliary trees 
to be used across several verb classes. 
6 Conclusion 
We have presented a class-based approach to build- 
ing a verb lexicon that makes explicit and imple- 
ments the close association between syntax and se- 
mantics, as postulated by Levin. The power of the 
lexicon comes from its dynamic aspect hat is based

Deriving Verb-Meaning Clusters from Syntactic Structure

Abstract
This paper presents a methodology for us-
ing the argument structure of sentences, as
encoded by the PropBank project, to de-
velop clusters of verbs with similar mean-
ing and usage. These clusters can be fa-
vorably compared to the classes developed
by the VerbNet project. The most inter-
esting cases are those where the cluster-
ing methodology suggests new members for
VerbNet classes which will then be associ-
ated with the semantic predicates for that
class.
1 Introduction
There can be no doubt that meaning is dependent
upon a great number of factors. The di?culty
in higher-level comprehension in Natural Language
Processing is due to the identication of these factors
as well as the successful implementation of methods
for handling them. Early generative models of syn-
tax failed to answer the meaning question because of
their assumption that semantics was a natural out-
come of structure, thus neglecting the other factors
involved. More recent works, such as those found
in WordNet (Miller, 1985; Fellbaum, 1998) and its
descendents, fall short for the inverse reason: they
focus solely on lexical meaning while ignoring struc-
ture altogether.
Another factor in the meaning game is the rela-
tionship between individual lexical items of the same
function. How are all determiners alike, for exam-
ple, and how are they individually dierent? Are
there subclasses within the class of determiners, and
how do these subclasses dier from each other? Hu-
man beings are supreme pattern-matchers and assign
things to categories almost to a fault. The categories
into which semantically loaded items are grouped
must therefore be one of the factors leading to higher-
level comprehension, and knowledge of what these
categories are and how they are built can help solve
the greater meaning question.
2 Issue and Previous Work
Much previous work in the domain of classication
of lexical items has focused on verbs. This is a nat-
ural starting place, since the verb is the hook upon
which the rest of a sentence hangs. Verbs also dis-
play a higher degree of variation in their semantics
than other lexical types. Whereas nouns, for exam-
ple, all name some kind of `thing,' verbs can de-
scribe an action or a state and involve some num-
ber of non-verbal actors in the description. It is
this latter quality of verbs which most interests us
here, and indeed which has been the focus of most
previous work in verb classication. Even the most
elementary grammars of English draw a distinction
between transitive and intransitive verbs. More ad-
vanced work has rened this distinction into ever-
larger numbers of classes. For example, the land-
mark work of Levin (1993) divided over three thou-
sand verbs into 191 classes based partly on shared se-
mantics and partly on shared syntactic alternations.
More recently, the VerbNet project at Penn (Kip-
per et al, 2000) incorporated Levin's verb classica-
tion to systematically create verb entries in a lexi-
con. On a purely semantic note, WordNet (Miller,
1985; Fellbaum, 1998) has classied much of the vo-
cabulary of English, not just verbs, in terms of rela-
tionships such as synonymy, hyponymy, and others.
Various attempts worldwide have begun focussing on
the argument structure of verbs as part of develop-
ing dependency grammars. The PropBank project
at Penn (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) is an exam-
ple of this process for English; similar projects are
underway for Czech (Hajicova etc), German (Broker
1998), and others. The FrameNet project at Berke-
ley (Baker et al, 1998) has classied many words in
terms of their relation to a relatively small number
of core semantic concepts such as `commerce' and
`judgment'. Various attempts have been made to
automatically cluster verbs into semantically mean-
ingful classes, using the Levin class as a gold stan-
dard for evaluation (Gildea, 2002; McCarthy, 2000;
Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde, 2000).
In the next two sections, we provide background on
VerbNet and PropBank which play central roles in
the cluster methodology presented here.
2.1 VerbNet
VerbNet is a verb lexicon with syntactic and seman-
tic information for English verbs, referring to Levin
verb classes (Levin, 1993) for systematic construc-
tion of lexical entries. This lexicon exploits the sys-
tematic link between syntax and semantics that mo-
tivates these classes, and thus provides a clear and
regular association between syntactic and semantic
properties of verbs and verb classes (Kipper et al,
2000; Dang et al, 2000). Each class in the hier-
archy is composed of a set of members (linked to
their WordNet synsets) and a set of syntactic frames
and semantic information for each frame. Currently,
VerbNet has over 4,000 verb senses described (3,004
lemmas) within 191 rst level classes.
VerbNet has a hierarchical structure, with the rst
level classes constituted by the original Levin classes.
In order to ensure that each class is coherent, so that
all its members share a common set of thematic roles,
syntactic frames and semantic predicates, some re-
structuring of the classes was required. This reorga-
nization, which was facilitated by the use of inter-
sective Levin classes (Dang et al, 1998), rened the
classes to account for semantic and syntactic dier-
ences within a class. A child subclass inherits all the
information from its parent class, and adds informa-
tion to it, which can be in terms of imposing further
restrictions on the roles, or adding syntactic frames
or semantic predicates to the subclass.
The hierarchical organization of VerbNet is illus-
trated in Figure 1. The Transfer of a Message verb
class is subdivided into three levels. At the top level
are thematic roles, syntactic frames and semantic
predicates shared by all members of the class. In
this particular case, there is a transitive frame with
the Topic (message) as the direct object (Agent Verb
Topic), as in \John explained trigonometry", and a
frame for Topic and Recipient (Agent Verb Topic to
Recipient), as in \John taught math to Mary". Both
syntactic frames have semantic predicates expressing
the transfer of information event, but in the rst case
the Recipient is underspecied. Some of the verbs in
this class are able to participate in other syntactic
frames as well. Verbs at the second level can take
the ditransitive frame (Agent Verb Recipient Topic)
in addition to the frames and predicates inherited
from the parent class.
VerbNet uses a at semantic representation in
which the semantics of each syntactic frame is cap-
tured by a conjunction of predicates
1
, such as mo-
tion, contact, transfer info, which can be negated or
not. These predicates can take arguments over the
verb complements, as well as over implicit existen-
tially quantied event variables.
Each semantic predicate in VerbNet alo include
a time function specifying whether the predicate
is true in the preparatory (during(E)), culmina-
tion (end(E)), or consequent (result(E)) stage of an
event, in a tripartite event structure is similar to that
of Moens and Steedman (1988), which allows us to
express the semantics of classes of verbs like change
of state verbs whose description requires reference to
a complex event structure.
2.2 PropBank
In a dierent vein, the PropBank project (Kingsbury
and Palmer, 2002) has endeavoured to describe all
the most frequent verbs of English in terms of their
argument structure. This project has three major
dierences from previous works. First, the descrip-
tion of each verb is accompanied by a rich set of
examples drawn from real language, in this case the
Wall Street Journal sections of the Penn Treebank
(Marcus, 1994). Furthermore, the descriptions are
based on the usages in the corpus, rather than a pos-
sible situation where the corpus was mined for sen-
tences tting preconceived patterns. This results in
many instances which are perfectly well-formed but
unexpected. The best example of this is an odd usage
of the verb add: The Nasdaq composite index added
1.01 to 456.6 on paltry volume., where the context
makes it clear that add is being used as a synonym for
rise. Second, argument structure allows for a richer
set of descriptions than merely `transitive', `unac-
cusative', and so forth, since any individual verb is
allowed to have anywhere between zero and six ar-
guments. Third and perhaps most importantly, the
PropBank descriptions make explicit mention of the
dierent senses of verbs. This is crucial because dif-
ferent senses can have dierent argument structures
or dierent syntactic alternations, a detail which is
often glossed over in other resources. Thus, while (1)

and (3) share the same argument structure, (2) and
(4) do not, because of the ungrammaticality of (4):
1 Congress passed the bill.
2 John passed the butter.
3 The bill passed.
4 *The butter passed.
Under the PropBank scheme, the similarity be-
tween pass (make bill into law) and pass (move
from one place to another) is regarded an almost-
accidental byproduct of centuries of semantic drift.
The combination of accounting for all the usages
in a large corpus and separating verb senses re-
sults in a very large database: 4358 distinct senses
spread across 3183 lexical items, with a total of over
70 000 unique tokens. PropBank annotations are
recorded as theory-neutrally as possible. Crucially,
the nomenclature of traditional thematic roles is not
used; instead, simple labels of Arg0, Arg1 and so
forth are used. Each ArgX is mapped to a specic
role on a per-verb basis, such as the roleset for give:
Arg0: giver
Arg1: gift
Arg2: given-to
ex: [
Arg0
The executives] gave [
Arg2
the
chefs] [
Arg1
a standing ovation].
Such a schema has its advantages and its draw-
backs. On the negative side, it makes it di?cult to
draw comparisons between various arguments with
the same number. The meaning of Arg2 for one verb
might bear no relation to the meaning of Arg2 for
some other verb, for example. On the plus side, not
using traditional thematic roles both frees the anno-
tators from the necessity of distinguishing between
Theme and Patient, for example, while also allowing
for roles which do not have corresponding thematic
roles. For example, PropBank has a host of verbs re-
lating to the judicial process, such as jail, sentence,
imprison, and so forth. All of these take four roles;
Arg0: lawgiver
Arg1: guilty party
Arg2: term, length of jail time
Arg3: crime
ex: Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton
had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with
his remarks to the press last December,
two weeks after [
Arg0
*trace=Hampton*]
sentencing [
Arg1
an 18-year-old defendant]
to [
Arg2
30 years in state prison] for [
Arg3
killing two homosexual men in a city park.]
While Args 0 and 1 can be thought of as Agent
and Patient, traditional thematic role terminology
fails to accommodate Args 2 and 3, for all that they
are central to the meaning of the verbs.
3 Methodology
The PropBank annotations thus provide a rich set
of actual usages which are easily divided into senses
and quantied. That is, for any verb (sense) it is
possible to collect all the usages, divide them into
their various syntactic realizations, and enumerate
these realizations. The realizations themselves are
rendered at a very basic level, encoding only the lin-
ear order of arguments. The verb itself is rendered
as rel for 'relation'. Thus a verb such as repeal can
appear in either a simple transitive or passive:
[
Arg0
West Germany] will repeal [
Arg1
the unpopular turnover tax on security
transactions]. (wsj 0302)
! Arg0 rel Arg1
...the tax will be o?cially repealed [
Arg1
*trace=the tax*] before the end of the
current parliamentary term... (wsj 0302)
! rel Arg1
As seen in the second example, adjuncts such as
the temporal before the end of the current parliamen-
tary term are omitted. While the bulk of annotations
fall into basic categories such as Arg0 rel Arg1 (ba-
sic transitive), Arg0 rel Arg1 Arg2 (ditransitive) and
so forth, the nature of the data and the annotation
process itself means that there is a large residue of ir-
regular syntactic realizations. As an example of the
former, consider the following sentence, where the
benefactive argument has been topicalized to the be-
ginning:
For [
Arg4
Mr. Sherwin], [
Arg0
a conviction]
could carry [
Arg1
penalties of ve years in
prison and a $250,000 ne on each count].
(wsj 1331) ! Arg4 Arg0 rel Arg1
Such a construction is certainly a natural part of
English, yet it occurs very rarely{only twice in all
of Propbank (so far). The annotation process itself
also introduces many odd, low-frequency syntactic
realizations which should be regarded as errors. For
example, occasionally annotators include one argu-
ment label twice:
...the board also was informed...of [
Arg1
in-
terest] expressed by [
Arg0
buy-out funds
including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
and Forstmann Little & Co.], as well as by
[
Arg0
Robert Bass, Morgan Stanley's buy-
out fund, and Pan Am Corp]. (wsj 2104)
! Arg1 rel Arg0 Arg0
In cases of such conjoined constructions the an-
notation guidelines specify that the sentence should
be regarded as two overlapping sentences, with two
overlapping argument structures. Thus, for the sen-
tence above, there should properly be two instances
of `Arg1 rel Arg0', each with the same Arg1 and rel
but with dierent Arg0's. The annotator of this sen-
tence clearly forgot this specication. Fortunately,
PropBank is proceeding through a double blind an-
notation followed by an adjudication phase. The ad-
judication will catch and correct structures such as
the above. For the time being, however, such errors
are retained, largely for want of an e?cient and ac-
curate ltering mechanism.
Other ltering on the data is performed, however.
Since the TreeBank corpus is subject to the same
Zipan distribution
2
of lexical items as any natural-
language database, many verbs are only poorly at-
tested. A largely arbitrary decision was made to
eliminate all verbs which had fewer than 10 attesta-
tions. Finally, again due to the ongoing nature of the
PropBank work, not all polysemous verbs have been
disambiguated. These verbs were also deleted from
the subsequent analysis. All the same, the resulting
dataset provides 921 verbs with 200 distinct syntactic
realizations of varying frequencies. Each realization
was recorded as a proportion of the number of attes-
tations of that syntactic pattern to the total num-
ber of attestations of that verb. Expressing these as
proportions rather than as raw counts allows for bet-
ter comparisons among verbs which themselves vary
widely in frequency. The proportions themselves are
then run through a standard clustering algorithm im-
plemented in R (http://www.R-project.org) which
classies each verb by the dierence between its at-
tested proportions and the proportions attested by
every other verb. Verbs with little dierence, mean-
ing they attest nearly the same syntactic patterns in
nearly the same proportions, are judged to be very
similar and are likely to be grouped into the same
class. A varying number of \centroids" or proto-
types for each class can be established. Each verb
is then classied by its similarity to the centroids,
resulting in a number of classes equal to the num-
ber of centroids. The resulting classes are compared
to the existing VerbNet classes. This is at best a
noisy measure of accuracy, since many of the Prop-
Banked verbs (even fairly richly-attested ones) are
not classied in VerbNet, and many verbs which are
classied in VerbNet are not present in PropBank in
su?cient numbers to undergo the clustering analysis.
These factors are constant across all possible number
of centroids/classes, however, so at least the amount
of noise in the assessment remains constant as well.
2
The probability of occurrence of words or other items
starts high and tapers o. Thus, a few occur very often
while many others occur rarely.
4 Results
As an initial assessment of the worth of the method-
ology, consider the case with only three clusters. The
clusters can be viewed graphically in Figure 2.
The crosses are the centroids. Such a display as
this is naturally a gross simplication of the actual
200-dimensional space the clusters are mapped in,
but it's the best that can be done on paper. If we look
at (a sample of) the membership of each of the three
clusters, we see that the three groups clearly fall into
the sets of transitive, unaccusative, and ditransitive
verbs:
3
Class 1 Class 2 Class 3
waste repay drift
ask.01 invest die
overcome appoint crumble
feel.01 invite triple
make.05 assign oat
inuence recruit disappear
For higher numbers of clusters a more formal
method of measuring accuracy is required. Since we
are comparing sets, the similarity of two sets A and
B can be computed with the following:
similarity(A;B) =
jA\Bj
jA[Bj
In other words, the similarity of two sets can be
measured as the number of elements shared by the
two sets divided by the total number of unique el-
ements in the two sets. Thus, two identical sets
(fa, bg fb, ag) would have a similarity score of 1,
because the intersection contains two elements, as
does the union. Two sets a, b and a, b, ..., z would
have a very low similarity score, since the intersec-
tion contains two elements, but that is divided by the
union with 26 elements. Thus the similarity score
is dependent both on the number of matches and
the number of spurious elements present. For exam-
ple, the three clusters described above most closely
align to the VerbNet classes 13.5.1 (Get class), 45.6
(Calibratable change state class), and 48.1.1 (Appear
class), respectively, with 4, 4, and 7 matching ele-
ments. Each of these clusters is huge, however (521,
335, and 65 verbs, respectively), and the target sets
are also large as VerbNet clusters go (31, 23, and 27
verbs, respectively). These factors conspire to make
the overall similarity scores quite low (4/(521+31),
3
ask.01: ask a question, as opposed to ask a favor;
feel.01: feel emotion; make.05: make money, as in \Paul
doesn't make nearly enough money; triple: while in most
English this would be considered a transitive verb, the
common usage in the Wall Street Journal is actually un-
acusative, as in \Paul's net worth tripled when he found
a $5 bill in the dryer'."
etc). This demonstrates how a three-cluster analy-
sis, while interesting for describing a gross syntactic
grouping, does not go very far in describing any ner-
grained meaning contrasts.
To get at the classication with real implications
for meaning we clearly need to use more, smaller clus-
ters. How many more, and how small? Since the
original set of verbs under analysis comes from 150
VerbNet classes, we can set an upper bound on the
number of clusters at 150. Then we iteratively derive
clusters for each number between 3 and 150 and nd
the similarity scores for each cluster in each of those
sets. To facilitate comparison between the various
sets of clusters, we calculate the average similarity
across all the classes. This is necessary because, as
the number of clusters rises, the size of any individual
cluster is likely to fall, thus bringing the denominator
of the similarity equation down. Taken across all the
clusters, then, the similarity scores are bound to rise
regardless of improvements in the matching between
the VerbNet clusters and the automatically-derived
ones. The outcome of this procedure can be seen in
Figure 3.
Interesting peaks appear for analyses with 14 clus-
ters and around 89 clusters before the long tailing
o with more than 90 clusters. In addition, there is
a local maximum around 32 clusters. The analyses
with 14 clusters still uses very large clusters (aver-
age of 65 verbs/cluster), so that number is less useful.
The smallest cluster developed therein, however, con-
sists only of `remain' and `stay.01',
4
and that cluster
correctly maps to VerbNet class 47.1-1 (Exist class),
which contains verbs of staying in place.
By the time around 90 clusters are used the derived
classes themselves tend to be very small, with 34
clusters containing two or fewer verbs. In contrast,
a few clusters continue to have very large member-
ship, such as two groups (arbitrarily labeled `3' and
`38') which contain 145 and 146 verbs, respectively,
and which correspond roughly to VerbNet classes
29.5 (Conjecture class) and 29.2 (Characterize class).
While 29.2 is one of the largest classes in VerbNet,
precisely why this class should seem to attract va-
grant verbs remains to be seen. More interesting,
however, are the times when the clustering process
establishes multiple clusters which are all identied
with the same VerbNet class { in eect, suggesting
subclasses where they have not previously appeared.
This trend appears even with fairly low numbers of
clusters, and it tends to be extremely consistent as to
which VerbNet clusters are split. For example, class
45.4 (Other change state), containing the `miscella-

3 clusters
Figure 2: Clusters for transitive, unaccusative, and ditransitive
neous causatives,' is rst split into two subclasses
even when only 9 clusters are in play, indicating
that there is more variation in the syntactic patterns
within this single class than there is between almost
any other arbitrarily-selected pair of classes. It is
hardly surprising that a collection labeled `miscella-
neous' should contain such a wide variety of syntac-
tic patterns. What is surprising, and encouraging, is
the speed at which this methodology identies this
miscellany and moves to correct it.
In one example of how previously-unclassied
verbs may be added to a VerbNet class, consider clus-
ter 20 within the 90-cluster analysis. This grouping
is optimally identied with VerbNet class 36.3 (Meet
class), verbs of combative meetings. It contains, un-
surprisingly, verbs such as ght and consult. The
clustering analysis adds, in addition, verbs such as
pull.02 (phrasal: pull out) and withdraw. The for-
mer, like all phrasal verbs, is neglected by VerbNet,
while the latter is considered to be part of the `re-
move' classes (10.1 and 10.5). Yet it might be just as
natural to think of withdraw in the sense of exiting
a meeting or an engagement rather than removing
something from somewhere. For example, \It was
just another one of the risk factors" that led to the
company's decision to withdraw from the bidding, he
added (wsj 0013). Another verb placed into this clus-
ter is hedge. Impressionistically, this might appear to
be restricted to \hedge one's bets" and thus a poor
match for this fairly combative class. Upon examina-
tion of the actual usages, however, it becomes clear
that most of the time hedge is being used to mean
protect (from), as in But some investors might pre-
fer a simpler strategy than hedging their individual
holdings (wsj 1962) or Thus, buying puts after a big
market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against
risk (wsj 2415). Seen this way, hedge is a plausible
member of this class, and since it is hitherto un-
treated by VerbNet, the clustering analysis provides
a valuable suggestion for an unexpected meaning. It
also avoids erroneously attributing a change of loca-
tion predicate to the sentence.
For another example, consider cluster 25 of the
same 90-cluster analysis. The verbs in this group
contain verbs of directed motion such as put.01 and
funnel, and is identied with VerbNet class 9.3 (Fun-
nel class). The VerbNet description for this class
species three arguments: Agent, Theme, and Des-
tination. The Destination role is further specied
as being restricted to those cases where the Theme
and Destination end up in close contact. Thus, this
class includes usages such as put the toy in the box
but not put the money towards a new car. Another
verb which is placed into this class is cast.01, which
is restricted to a small number of near-idioms such
as cast a pall (over) and cast doubt (on). Because of
this restriction, it has not previously been handled
by VerbNet. The clustering successfully includes this
in the same class as put and funnel, even including
the selectional restriction on the types of Destina-
tion allowed, for only over and on will be found with
this sense of cast. This would also assign the correct
semantic predicates to cast.

5 Conclusion and Future Directions
Clustering of syntactic patterns can quickly and
automatically provide a rst approximation of the
groupings into which meaning-bearing items fall.
The methodology easily captures low-level gen-
eralizations and points out shortcomings in the
'gold standard' verb classication against which it
was judged. Nevertheless, it is only a rst pass
at transforming syntactic structure into semantics.
Additional information is available to extend the
paradigm. For example, the syntactic patterns which
were the subject of the clustering algorithm were
nothing more than the linear order of the argu-
ments of the verb. Further renement on the syn-
tactic structure would be possible, at the expense of
multiplying the patterns. For instance, in the pre-
ceding all prepositions were stripped from the ar-
gument structure, even though PropBank includes
the preposition as part of the argument label rather
than as part of the argument itself. Also, it would
be possible to label the arguments with thematic
roles instead of the generic labels used by PropBank,
when possible, thus providing a measure of semantics
mixed in with the syntax. Kipper et al (submitted,
2003) describes the process of mapping PropBank
argument labels onto VerbNet thematic roles. Cur-
rently, over 64% of the PropBank argument labels
have been mapped automatically, and that is with-
out recourse to the sense-disambiguated data. This
suggests that the two resources are highly compati-
ble and that the combined data could easily be used
in the clustering methodology. A larger measure of
meaning could be added if some notion of the mean-
ing of the verbs could be included in the clustering
as well. For example, WordNet synonym sets, espe-
cially as encoded in VerbNet, could be used as the
initial state of the clusters, which then could be mod-
ied by the dis/similarity of the syntactic patterns
attested by those verbs. Such renements to the pro-
cess would in themselves be steps towards integrating
the many factors that contribute to the understand-
ing of meaning.

Abstract
This paper presents a detailed account of
prepositional mismatch between our hand-
crafted verb lexicon and a semantically an-
notated corpus. The analysis of these mis-
matches allows us to rene the lexicon and
to create a more robust resource capable
of better semantic predictions based on the
verb-preposition relations.
1 Introduction
There is currently much interest in training super-
vised systems to perform shallow semantic annota-
tion tasks such as word sense tagging and semantic
role labeling. These systems are typically trained on
annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank [Mar-
cus1994], and perform best when they are tested on
data from the same genre. A more long-term goal
is to develop systems that will perform equally well
on diverse genres, and that will also be able to per-
form additional, more complex, semantic annotation
tasks. With this end in mind, we have been man-
ually developing a large-scale, general purpose hi-
erarchical verb lexicon that, in addition to links to
WordNet senses [Miller1985, Fellbaum1998], has ex-
plicit and detailed syntactic and semantic informa-
tion associated with each entry. Much of the syn-
tactic information is derived from the Levin verb
classes, although the classication has been extended
and modied. Sets of syntactic frames are associated
with each verb class, and specic prepositions are
often listed as well. We are interested in evaluating
how well our lexicon predicts syntactic frames in nat-
urally occurring data. This will give us an estimate
of its likely usefulness in extending the coverage of
systems trained on one genre to other genres.
This paper presents a comparison between our hi-
erarchical verb lexicon, VerbNet [Kipper et al2000,
Dang et al2000], and a corpus annotated seman-
tically with predicate-argument structure, Prop-
Bank [Kingsbury and Palmer2002]. We briey de-
scribe an experiment which established a baseline for
the syntactic coverage of the verb lexicon and more
extensively we compare and discuss the preposition
mismatches found while doing this evaluation. We
used this experiment, which used almost 50,000 verb
instances, to measure how well the linguistic intu-
itions motivating our verb lexicon are attested to in
the actual data. It allowed us to determine which
of the expected syntactic frames and specic prepo-
sitions occur and which do not, and also look for
unexpected occurrences. Although prepositions are
generally described as restrictions on syntax, their
signicance goes far beyond that of a syntactic re-
striction. Verb-preposition relations can also allow
us to make predictions about the semantic contents
of a verb-frame.
The mapping between the two resources was done
by assigning verb classes to the dierent senses in
PropBank and by assigning the thematic roles used
to describe VerbNet classes to argument roles of
PropBank. The criteria used for matches includes
both a notion of exact frame match where the en-
countered preposition was explicitly listed in the
frame, as well as a more relaxed notion of frame
match that allows alternative prepositions. We found
that under the former, our lexicon correctly predicts
over 78% of all the syntactic frames found in Prop-
Bank, while under the latter criterion, the results go
up to 81%. This dierential hints at the di?culty of
accounting for semantically signicant prepositions
in sentences. We believe that it is precisely because
the preposition-semantics relationship is so complex
that properly accounting for it will lead to a more
robust natural language resource.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Sections 2 and 3 present the lexical resources used for
the experiment. Section 4 discusses the evaluation
of VerbNet against PropBank and Section 5 shows
examples of preposition mismatches between the two
resources.
2 VerbNet's components
VerbNet is an on-line broad-coverage domain-
independent lexical resource with syntactic descrip-
tions for over 4,100 verbs organized into classes ac-
cording to the Levin classication [Levin1993]. It is
a general purpose verb lexicon created initially with
the task of instructing a virtual character in a simu-
lated environment in mind [Badler et al1999,Bindi-
ganavale et al2000].
VerbNet extends Levin's classication by pro-
viding explicit syntactic and semantic information
about the verbs it describes. In addition, the lex-
icon is organized hierarchically so that all verbs in
a class (or subclass) share these syntactic descrip-
tions and have common semantics. Each verb class is
completely described by the set of its members (each
verb has links to the appropriate senses in WordNet,
thematic roles for the predicate-argument structure
of the members, selectional restrictions on these ar-
guments to express preferred argument types, and
frames. Each frame consists of a brief description,
an example, a syntactic description corresponding to
one of Levin's alternations, and a set of semantic
predicates. In addition, each predicate has a time
function to show at what stage of the event the pred-
icate holds true, in a manner similar to the event
decomposition of Moens and Steedman (1988) . In
order for the members of each class to be coherent
with respect to the thematic roles, selectional restric-
tions, syntactic frames, and semantics they allow, we
rened the original Levin classes and added 74 new
subclasses.
VerbNet's broad-coverage, with explicit syntax
and semantics, attempts to address several gaps
present in other resources. WordNet was designed
mainly as a semantic network, and contains little
syntactic information. VerbNet, in contrast, includes
explicit predicate argument structures for verbs in
their classes, as well as a way to systematically ex-
tend those senses based on the semantics of each
class. FrameNet [Baker et al1998] and VerbNet both
contain the notion of verb groupings. The group-
ings in FrameNet however are based solely on the
semantic roles shared by the members of a class.
These members do not need to have the same set of
syntactic frames, and lack explicit semantics other
than what is provided by the semantic labels. Un-
like VerbNet, which uses a small set of thematic roles
for all classes, FrameNet uses frame elements which
are particular to a lexical item or to small groups of
frames. Besides, one of the benets of constructing
a general lexicon like VerbNet is that it allows one
to extend the coverage of resources tied to specic
corpora.
The syntactic frames in VerbNet describe the sur-
face realization for constructions such as transitive,
intransitive, prepositional phrases, resultatives, and
a large set of Levin's alternations. A syntactic frame
consists of the thematic roles, the verb, and other
lexical items which may be required for a particu-
lar construction or alternation. Additional restric-
tions may be further imposed on the thematic roles
(quotation, plural, innitival, etc.). Illustrations of
syntactic frames are shown in examples 1, 2, and 3.
(1) Agent V Patient
(John hit the ball)
(2) Agent V at Patient
(John hit at the window)
(3) Agent V Patient[+plural] together
(John hit the sticks together)
VerbNet alo includes a hierarchy of prepositions,
with 57 entries, derived from an extended version
of work described in Sparck-Jones and Boguraev
(1987). This restriction is necessary in order to spec-
ify which prepositions are possible in a particular
frame since many of Levin's alternations require spe-
cic prepositions such as `as' or `with/against'. A
partial and somewhat simplied hierarchy is shown
in Figure 1. This gure shows the spatial preposi-
tions hierarchy divided into path and locative prepo-
sitions. Path prepositions are further subdivided into
source, direction, and destination prepositions. A
syntactic frame with Prep[+src] as a constraint will
allow only those specic prepositions (from, out, out
of, etc) that are part of the spatial, path, source hi-
erarchy.
The semantic information for the verbs in Verb-
Net is expressed as a conjunction of semantic pred-
icates, any of which may be negated. These seman-
tic predicates fall into four categories: general pred-
icates such as motion and cause which are widely
used across classes; variable predicates whose mean-
ing is assumed to be in a one-to-one relation with a
set of words in the language; predicates that are spe-
cic to certain classes; and predicates for multiple
events which are used to express relations between
events. The semantic predicates can take arguments
over the verb complements, as well as over implicit
existentially quantied event variables.

classes) such as the ones predicted in FrameNet, can
also be veried by the semantic predicates, for in-
stance all of the Communication classes have the
same predicates of cause and transfer info. Aspect in
VerbNet is captured by the time function argument
present in the predicates.
3 PropBank
The PropBank project [Kingsbury and Palmer2002]
is annotating the Penn Treebank with predicate-
argument structures. Semantic roles are dened for
each verb in PropBank. These roles are meant to be
theory neutral and are simply numbered. Verb senses
are distinguished by dierent Framesets, with a sep-
arate set of numbered roles, called a roleset, dened
for each Frameset. An example of the Framesets for
the verb leave can be seen in Figure 2. Arg0 is usually
associated with Agent and Arg1 is usually similar to
Theme or Patient. However, argument labels are not
necessarily signicant across dierent verb meanings
or across dierent verbs.

4 Matching syntactic coverage
between the two resources
In order to test the syntactic coverage of VerbNet, we
performed an experiment to identify which syntactic
frames found in the PropBank corpus are represented
in our verb lexicon. As expected, we uncovered syn-
tactic frames and prepositions not initially predicted
in our resource which may now be added.
For this evaluation 49,073 PropBank annotated in-
stances were used, which translated into 1,678 verb
entries in VerbNet. Since the notion of a Prop-
Bank Frameset and a VerbNet class are not perfectly
equivalent, an individual Frameset may be mapped
to multiple classes. In order to put the two re-
sources in correspondence we created mappings be-
tween the Framesets and our verb classes, as well as
mappings between the argument labels in the roleset
of a Frameset to the thematic roles in our classes.
The process of assigning a verb class to a Frameset
was performed manually during the creation of new
PropBank frames. The thematic role assignment, on
the other hand, is a semi-automatic process which
nds the best match for the argument labels, based
on their descriptors, to the set of thematic roles of
VerbNet.
To verify whether a particular syntactic frame
found in PropBank was present in our lexicon, we
translated the PropBank annotated sentence into
VerbNet-style frames. An example of this transla-
tion for the verb leave is given below. Example sen-
tence (4) is taken from the corpus, its PropBank an-
notation can be seen in (5), and the VerbNet-style
frame is shown in (6). In this example, the verb
leave is mapped to two VerbNet classes 51.2 (Leave
class), and 13.3 (Future-having class), with dierent
roles mapped to the argument labels in each of these
classes.
(4) wsj/05/wsj 0568.mrg 12 4:
The tax payments will leave Unisys with $ 225
million *U* in loss carry-forwards that *T*-1 will
cut tax payments in future quarters .
(5) [
ARG0
The tax payments] [
rel
leave] [
ARG2

[
ARG1 with
with $ 225 million]
(6) (a) leave-51.2: Theme V NP Prep(with) Source
(b) future having-13.3: Agent V Recipient
Prep(with) Theme
In this instance, only the latter of the two con-
structed frames matches a frame in VerbNet. In ef-
fect, this serves as a sort of sense disambiguation, as
the leave entry in class 51.2 has the sense \to exit,"
while the entry in class 13.3 has a sense similar to
the verb \to give." In fact the sense of \leave" in the
sentence is the latter, and the single matched frame
conrms this.
In general, we used several criteria when attempt-
ing to match a constructed frame to a frame in Verb-
Net. Two of these criteria are of primary interest for
this paper:
1. the exact frame description was present in Verb-
Net (henceforth called \exact match", or a
match under the strict criterion);
2. the frame description is present in VerbNet but
there is a preposition mismatch (henceforth re-
ferred as a \relaxed match").
For instance, if the translated corpus sentence
is Agent V Prep(as) Theme, but VerbNet predicts
Agent V Prep(for) Theme for verbs in the class, this
annotation would be considered a relaxed match,
but not an exact match. VerbNet predicts 78% of
frames found in PropBank under the strict criterion
and 81% of those frames under the relaxed criterion.
More details of this experiment are described in Kip-
per et al (2004) .
5 Using prepositions from the
corpus to rene verb classes
By comparing our theoretically motivated sets of
syntactic frames for an individual verb with the ac-
tual data, we can evaluate both the coverage of our
lexicon and its theoretical underpinnings. There are
many questions to be addressed with respect to cov-
erage: Do the predicted syntactic frames occur? Do
the predicted prepositions occur? Do other, unpre-
dicted prepositions occur as well? Depending on the
answers to these questions, prepositions (or syntactic
frames) may be inserted into or deleted from specic
classes and entire classes may be restructured.
Our verb lexicon matches over 78% of all the syn-
tactic frames found in PropBank. However, when
restricting the frames found in PropBank to those
without prepositions, the resulting match rate is al-
most 81%. This dierence hints at the di?culty
of accounting for semantically signicant preposi-
tions in sentences, and a proper account of this
preposition-semantic relationship seems essential to
us in order to build a more robust lexical resource.
5.1 Prepositions in the Corpus
Verb occurrences are partitioned according to
whether a preposition occurs or not in the instance
frame, and according to how well the constructed
frame matches a VerbNet frame. Almost 4/5 of the
verb instances studied do not contain a signicant
preposition in their PropBank annotation (and con-
sequently their constructed frames do not include
any prepositions).
1
On these instances, we obtained
a 81% match rate under the strict criterion.
1
We consider a preposition \signicant" if the prepo-
sition object is a PropBank argument with a mapping to
a thematic role, excluding preposition \by".
Of the 49,073 verb instances we are looking at,
9,304 instances had a signicant preposition, with
constructed frames including one or more preposi-
tional items. For those we obtain match rates of
65% and 76% (depending on whether preposition
mismatches were allowed or not).
The dierence between the 81% match rate of the
frames without prepositions and the 65%-76% match
rate in the frames with prepositions is substantial
enough to lead us to believe that a close examina-
tion of the sentences containing a preposition and
their comparison to VerbNet frames would allow us
to improve the coherence of our verb classes.
5.2 Prepositional Mismatch
For the instances with signicant prepositional
items, 65% (6,033 instances) have constructed frames
with an exact match to VerbNet. Of the remaining
3,271 instances, 1,015 are relaxed matches, and 2,256
do not bear any matches to VerbNet frames.
We focused on those verb instances which would
have matched a VerbNet frame if only a dierent
preposition had been used in the sentence or if the
VerbNet frame had included a wider range of prepo-
sitions. In addition to the 1,015 instances, we looked
at 652 verb instances, all of which share the follow-
ing two properties: (i) that the verb in question is
contained in multiple VerbNet classes, and (ii) that
although the constructed frame matches one of those
VerbNet classes exactly, there is at least one other
class where it matches only under the relaxed crite-
rion (when the value of the preposition is ignored).
These instances are important because the value of
the preposition in these cases can help decide which
is the most appropriate VerbNet class for that in-
stance. This information could then be used for
coarse-grained automatic sense tagging { either to
establish a PropBank Frameset or a set of WordNet
senses for those instances, since verbs instances in
our verb lexicon are mapped to that resource.
These 1,667 verb instances (1,015 preposition mis-
matches + 652 exact matches) comprise 285 unique
verbs and are mapped to a total of 97 verb classes.
5.3 Explanation of Mismatch
After a close examination of these 1,667 instances,
we veried that the mismatches can be explained and
divided into the following cases:
1. cases where a preposition should be added to a
VerbNet class (in some of these cases, a rene-
ment of the class into more specic subclasses is
needed, since not all members take the included
preposition);
2. cases where the particular usage of the verb is
not captured by any VerbNet entry (this is the
case with metaphorical uses of certain verbs);
3. incorrect mappings between PropBank and
VerbNet;
2
4. cases where the PropBank annotation is incon-
sistent;
5. cases where the particular instance belongs to
another VerbNet class (which are expected since
the PropBank data used does not yet provide
sense tags).
As an example, in the PropBank annotated corpus
we nd the sentence:
\Lotus Development Corp. feeds its evaluations
into a computer...",
The verb to feed is present in four VerbNet classes.
The frame resulting from translating the PropBank
annotation to a VerbNet-style frame Agent V Theme
Prep(into) Recipient bears a resemblance to a frame
present in one of the classes (Give-13.1, syntactic
frame Agent V Theme Prep(to) Recipient). This is
a case where a VerbNet class requires renements
(with addition of new subclasses) to account for
prepositions unique to a subset of the verbs in the
class. It is an open question whether such rene-
ments, taken to completion, would result in sub-
classes that are so ne-grained they have a mem-
bership of one. If so, it may be more appropriate to
add verb-specic preposition preferences to existing
classes.
Another example is the following use of \build" in
the PropBank corpus:
\...to build their resumes through good grades and
leadership roles ..."
This sentence yields the frame Agent V Product
Prep(through) Material after translating the Prop-
Bank annotation to a VerbNet-style frame. This
frame bears a relaxed match to the Agent V Product
Prep(from, out of) Material syntactic frame found
in the Build-26.1 class. In VerbNet, the phrase
\..through good grades ..." is considered an adjunct
and therefore not relevant for the syntactic frame.
In PropBank, however, this phrase is annotated as
an argument (Arg2), which maps to the \Material"
thematic role in VerbNet. This example shows, as ex-
pected, mismatches between argument and adjuncts
in the two resources.
As a nal example, consider the following use of
the verb lease:
2
We asserted an error of 6.7% for the automatic map-
pings in a random sample of the data.
\The company said it was leasing the site of the
renery from Aruba."
Two frames are constructed for this verb instance,
one for each of the VerbNet classes to which the
PropBank lease Frameset is mapped. Its member-
ship in class Get-13.5.1, and class Give-13.1 respec-
tively yield the following two VerbNet-style frames:
(a) 13.1: Agent V Theme Prep(from) Recipient
(b) 13.5.1: Agent V Theme Prep(from) Source.
The rst frame bears a relaxed match to a frame
in its class (Agent V Theme Prep(to) Recipient)
whereas the second is an exact match to a frame
in the second class. In this instance, the preposition
`selects' the appropriate VerbNet class.
3
In fact, we
expect this to happen in all the 652 instances with ex-
act matches, since in those instances, the constructed
frame bears an exact match to one VerbNet class, but
a relaxed match to another. The dierent Framesets
of a verb are typically mapped to distinct sets of
VerbNet classes. If the preposition present in the
sentence matches frames in only a subset of those
VerbNet classes, then we are able to rule out cer-
tain Framesets as putative senses of the instance in
a sense tagging task.
6 Conclusion
We presented a detailed account of how prepositions
taken from a semantically annotated corpus can be
used to extend and rene a hand-crafted resource
with syntactic and semantic information for English
verbs. That the role of prepositions should not be
neglected can be clearly seen from the dierential in
match rates between those sentences with preposi-
tions and those without. The signicance of prepo-
sitions and their relation with verbs is of the utmost
importance for a robust verb lexicon, not only as
a syntactic restrictor, but also as a predictor of se-
mantic content. On the basis of these experiments
we are adding 132 new subclasses to VerbNet's ini-
tial 191 classes and 74 subclasses, going far beyond
basic Levin Classes.
One of the payos of constructing a general lexicon
like VerbNet is that it allows one to extend the cov-
erage of resources tied to specic corpora (e.g. Prop-
Bank, FrameNet). Currently we are in the process of
adding mappings between our verbs and FrameNet
verbs and mappings between our syntactic frames
and Xtag [XTAG Research Group2001] trees. These

It was pointed out that a possible interpretation is
that \from Aruba" is linked to the \renery" argument,
in which case this instance would be translated as Agent
V Theme and therefore have a perfect match to the Give-
13.1 class.
mappings will allow us to more deeply investigate
verb behavior.

Natural Language ~-~I Planner PAR graphics 
Figure 3: General architecture of the animation system 
The planner uses information from the general 
schema, such as pre-conditions and post-assertions, 
as well as information derived from the agents' ca- 
pabilities and the objects properties to fill in these 
gaps in several ways: 
? to select he way (activity) in which the instruc- 
tion is performed (enter by walking, by swim- 
ming, etc.); 
? to determine the prepartory actions that must 
be completed before the instruction is carried 
out, (for example, in order for an agent o open 
the door, the door has to be reachable and that 
may involve a locomotion process); 
? to decompose the action into smaller units (put 
the glass on the table, involves getting the glass, 
planning a route to the table, etc.) 
The output of the planner for the input instruction 
is a complete description of the actions involved, in- 
cluding participants, preparatory specifications, ter- 
mination conditions, manner, duration, etc. Partic- 
ipants bring with them a list of inherent properties 
of the agent (e.g. agent capabilities) or physical ob- 
jects (e.g., object configurations) and other charac- 
teristics, such as 'how to open' for an object such 
as a door. This complete description refers to a set 
of animation PARS which can be immediately ani- 
mated. 
In this way, a PAR schema for the action enter 
may actually translate into an animation PAR for 
walking into a certain area. One way to differenti- 
ate between action PAR schemas and instantiated 
animation PARs is to consider what it is possible to 
motion capture 4 (by attaching sensors to a moving 
human figure). For example, the enter action and 
the put action are quite general and underspecified 
and could not be motion captured. However, char- 
acteristic activities such as walking and swimming 
could be. For further details about the animation 
PARs and the animation system see (Badler et al, 
1999) and (Bindiganavaie et al, 2000). 
4 PAR as an IL  
The PAR representation for an action can be seen as 
a general template. PAR schemas include, as part 
of the basic sub-categorization frame, properties of

example, through inverse kinematics, dynamics and key- 
framing. 
the action that can occur linguistically either as the 
main verb or as adjuncts to the main verb phrase. 
This captures problems of divergences, uch as the 
ones described by Talmy (Talmy, 1991), for verb- 
framed versus satellite-framed languages. 
New information may come from a sentence in 
natural anguage that modifies the action's inherent 
properties, uch as in John hit the ball slowly, where 
'slowly' is not part of the initial representation of
the action 'hit'. This new information is added to 
the PAR schema. 
Verb- versus Satel l i te-framed languages 
Verb-Framed Languages (VFL) map the motion 
(path or path + ground location) onto the verb, 
and the manner either onto a satellite or an ad- 
junct, while Satellite-Framed Languages (SFL) map 
the motion into the satellite, and the manner onto 
the main verb. 
English and other Germanic languages are consid- 
ered satellite-framed languages, expressing the path 
in the satellite; Spanish, among other Romance lan- 
guages, is a verb-framed language and expresses the 
path in the main verb. The pairs of sentences (1) 
and (2) from Talmy (1991) show examples of these 
divergences. In (1), in English, the exit of the bot- 
tle is expressed by the preposition out, in Spanish 
the same concept is incorporated in the main verb 
salir (to exit). In (2), the concept of blowing out 
the candle is represented differently in English and 
Spanish. 
(1) The bottle .floated out 
La boteUa sali6 flotando 
(the bottle exited floating) 
(2) I blew out the candle 
Apagud la vela sopldndola 
(I extinguish the candle blowing) 
4.1 Mot ion  
In order to capture generalizations about motion ac- 
tions, we have a generalized PAR schema for mo- 
tion, and our hierarchy includes different ypes of 
motion actions such as inherently directed motion 
and manner of motion actions that inherit from the 
more general schema, as shown in Figure 4. Directed 
motion actions, such as enter and exit, don't bring 
with them the manner by which the action is carried 
out but they have a inherent ermination condition. 
For example, 'enter a room' may be done by walk- 
ing, crawling or flying depending on the agents' ca- 
14

pabilities, but it should end when the agent is in the 
room. In contrast, manner of motion verbs express 
the action explicitly and don't have an intrinsic ter- 
mination condition. 
Motion is a type of framing event where the path 
is in the main verb for VFLs and in the satellite for 
SFLs. In (3), we see the English sentence expressing 
the 'enter' idea in the preposition into whereas the 
Spanish sentence expresses it in the main verb entrar 
(to enter). 
(3) The bottle floated into the cave 
La botella entr5 flotando a la cueva 
(the bottle entered floating the cave) 
The PAR schemas don't distinguish the represen- 
tation for these sentences, because there is a sin- 
gle schema which includes both the manner and the 
path without specifying how they are realiized lin- 
guistically. Mappings from the lexical items to the 
schemas or to constraints in the schemas can be seen 
in Figure 5. 5 Independent of which is the source lan- 
guage, the PAR schema selected is motion, the ac- 
tivity field, which determines how the action is per- 
formed (in this case, by floating), is filled by float 
(the main verb in English, or the adjunct in Span- 
ish). The termination condition, which says that 
action ends when the agent is in the object, is added 
from the preposition in English and is part of the 
semantics of the main verb to enter in Spanish.

SP entrar/\[par:motion,term:in(AG,OBJ)\]

lation are specified in this representation, it is up

semantics: For instance, float in English can be used also in 
the non-motion sense, in which case there will be two entries 
to capture that distinction.

Comparison with other work 
Our approach now diverges considerably from the 
approach outlined in Palmer et al (1998) which 
discusses the use of Feature-Based Tree Adjoining 
Grammars, (Joshi, 1985; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 
1991) to capture generalizations about manner-of- 
motion verbs. They do not propose an interlin- 
gua but use a transfer-based mechanism expressed 
in Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars to cap- 
ture divergences of VFL and SFL through the use 
of semantic features and links between the gram- 
mars. The problem of whether or not a preposi- 
tional phrase constitutes an argument to a verb or 
an adjunct (described by Palmer et al) does not 
constitute a problem in our representation, since all 
the information is recovered in the same template 
for the action to be animated. 
The PAR approach is much more similar to 
the Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) approach, 
(Jackendoff, 1972; Jackendoff, 1990), used as an in- 
terlingua representation (Doff, 1993). Based on the 
assumption that motion and manner of motion are 
conflated in a matrix verb like swim, the use of LCS 
allows separation of the concepts of motion, direc- 
tion, and manner of motion in the sentence John 
swam across the lake. Each one of these concepts i  
15 
represented separately in the interlingua represen- 
tation, as GO, PATH and MANNER, respectively. 
Our approach allows for a similar representation a d 
the end result is the same, namely that the event of 
swimming across the lake is characterized by sepa- 
rate semantic omponents, which can be expressed 
by the main schema nd by the activity field. In ad- 
dition, our representation also incorporates details 
about the action such as applicability conditions, 
preparatory specifications, termination conditions, 
and adverbial modifiers. It is not clear to us how 
the LCS approach could be used to effect the same 
commonality of representation. 
4.2 Ins t rument  
The importance of the additional information such 
as the termination conditions can be more clearly 
illustrated with a different set of examples. Another 
class of actions that presents interesting divergences 
involves instruments where the instrument is used 
as the main verb or as an adjunct depending on the 
language. The sentence pair in (4) shows this di- 
vergence for English and Portuguese. Because Por- 
tuguese does not have a verb for to spoon, it uses 
a more general verb colocar (to put) as the main 
verb and expresses the instrument in a prepositional 
phrase. Unlike directed motion actions, a put with 
hand-held instrument action (e.g., spoon, scoop, la- 
dle, etc.) leaves the activity field unspecified in both 
languages. The specific action is generated by taking 
the instrument into account. A simplified schema is 
shown in Figure 7.

Mary coloca chocolate sobre o sorvete coma 
colher 
(Mary puts chocolate over the ice cream with 
a spoon)

activity : - 
participants : 
agent: Mary 
objects: chocolate, 
icecresm, 
spoon 
preparatory_spec : get(Mary, spoon) 
termination_cond : over(chocolate, icecream) 
Figure 7: Representation f the sentences in (4) 
Notice that the only connection between to spoon 
and its Portuguese translation would be the termi- 
nation condition where the object of the verb, choco- 
late, has a new location which is over the ice cream. 
5 Conc lus ion  
We have discussed a parameterized representation 
of actions grounded by the needs of animation of 
instructions in a simulated environment. In order 
to support he animation of these instructions, our 
representation makes explicit many details that are 
often underspecified in the language, such as start 
and end states and changes in the environment that 
happen as a result of the action. 
Sometimes the start and end state information 
provides critical information for accurate translation 
but it is not always necessary. Machine translation 
can often simply preserve ambiguities in the transla- 
tion without resolving them. In our application we 
cannot afford this luxury. An interesting question 
to pursue for future work will be whether or not we 
can determine which PAR slots are not needed for 
machine translation purposes. 
Generalizations based on action classes provide 
the basis for an interlingua pproach that captures 
the semantics of actions without committing to any 
language-dependent specification. This framework 
offers a strong foundation for handling the range 
of phenomena presented by the machine translation 
task. 
The structure of our PAR schemas incorpo- 
rate into a single template the kind of divergence 
presented in verb-framed and satellite-framed lan- 
guages. Although not shown in this paper, this 
representation can also capture idioms and non- 
compositional constructions since the animations of 
actions - and therefore the PARs that control them 
- must be equivalent for the same actions described 
in different languages. 
Currently, we are also investigating the possibility 
of building these action representations from a class- 
based verb lexicon which has explicit syntactic and 
semantic information (Kipper et al, 2000).
