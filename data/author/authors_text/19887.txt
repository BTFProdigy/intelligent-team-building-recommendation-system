Abstract
There is a growing interest in automatically predicting the gender and age of authors from texts.
However, most research so far ignores that language use is related to the social identity of speak-
ers, which may be different from their biological identity. In this paper, we combine insights
from sociolinguistics with data collected through an online game, to underline the importance
of approaching age and gender as social variables rather than static biological variables. In our
game, thousands of players guessed the gender and age of Twitter users based on tweets alone.
We show that more than 10% of the Twitter users do not employ language that the crowd as-
sociates with their biological sex. It is also shown that older Twitter users are often perceived
to be younger. Our findings highlight the limitations of current approaches to gender and age
prediction from texts.
1 Introduction
A major thrust of research in sociolinguistics aims to uncover the relationship between social variables
such as age and gender, and language use (Holmes and Meyerhoff, 2003; Eckert and McConnell-Ginet,
2013; Eckert, 1997; Wagner, 2012). In line with scholars from a variety of disciplines, including the so-
cial sciences and philosophy, sociolinguists consider age and gender as social and fluid variables (Eckert,
2012). Gender and age are shaped depending on the societal context, the culture of the speakers involved
in a conversation, the individual experiences and the multitude of social roles: a female teenager might
also be a high school student, a piano player, a swimmer, etc. (Eckert, 2008).
Speakers use language as a resource to construct their identity (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). For example,
a person?s gender identity is constructed through language by using linguistic features associated with
male or female speech. These features gain social meaning in a cultural and societal context. On Twitter,
users construct their identity through interacting with other users (Marwick and boyd, 2011). Depending
on the context, they may emphasize specific aspects of their identity, which leads to linguistic variation
both within and between speakers. We illustrate this with the following three tweets:
Tweet 1: I?m walking on sunshine <3 #and don?t you feel good
Tweet 2: lalaloveya <3
Tweet 3: @USER loveyou ;D
In these tweets, we find linguistic markers usually associated with females (e.g. a heart represented
as <3). Indeed, 77% of the 181 players guessed that a female wrote these tweets in our online game.
However, this is a 16-year old biological male, whose Twitter account reveals that he mostly engages
with female friends. Therefore, he may have accommodated his style to them (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
et al., 2011) and as a result he employs linguistic markers associated with the opposite biological sex.

Most of the NLP research focusing on predicting gender and age has approached these variables as bi-
ological and static, rather than social and fluid. For example, current approaches use supervised machine
learning models trained on tweets from males and females. However, the resulting stereotypical models
are ineffective for Twitter users who tweet differently from what is to be expected from their biological
sex.
As explained above, language use is based on social gender and age identity, and not on biological sex
and chronological age. In other words, treating gender and age as fixed biological variables in analyzing
language use is too simplistic. By comparing the biological sex and chronological age of Twitter users
with how they are perceived by the crowd (as an indication of socially constructed identities), we shed
light on the difficulty of predicting gender and age from language use and draw attention to the inherent
limitations of current approaches.
As has been demonstrated in several studies, the crowd can be used for experimentation (e.g., Munro
et al. (2010)). Our study illustrates the value of the crowd for the study of human behavior, in particular
for the experimental study of the social dimension of language use. To collect data, we created an online
game (an example of gamification (Deterding et al., 2011)) in which thousands of players (the crowd)
guessed the biological sex and age of Twitter users based on only the users? tweets. While variance
between annotators has traditionally been treated as noise, more recently variation is being treated as a
signal rather than noise (Aroyo and Welty, 2013). For example, Makatchev and Simmons (2011) analyze
how English utterances are perceived differently across language communities.
This paper follows this trend, treating variation as meaningful information. We assume that the crowd?s
perception (based on the distribution of the players? guesses) is an indication of to what extent Twitter
users emphasize their gender and age identity in their tweets. For example, when a large proportion of
the players guess the same gender for a particular user, the user is assumed to employ linguistic markers
that the crowd associates with gender-specific speech (e.g. iconic hearts used by females).
Our contributions are as follows:
? We demonstrate the use of gamification to study sociolinguistic research problems (Section 3).
? We study the difficulty of predicting an author?s gender (Section 4) and age (Section 5) from text
alone by analyzing prediction performance by the crowd. We relate our results to sociolinguistic
theories and show that approaching gender and age as fixed biological variables is too simplistic.
? Based on our findings, we reflect on current approaches to predicting age and gender from text, and
draw attention to the limitations of these approaches (Section 6).
2 Related Work
Gender Within sociolinguistics, studies on gender and language have a long history (Eckert and
McConnell-Ginet, 2013). More recently, the NLP community has become increasingly interested in
this topic. Most of the work aims at predicting the gender of authors based on their text, thereby focusing
more on prediction performance than sociolinguistic insights.
A variety of datasets have been used, including Twitter (Rao et al., 2010; Bamman et al., 2014; Fink et
al., 2012; Bergsma and Van Durme, 2013; Burger et al., 2011), blogs (Mukherjee and Liu, 2010; Schler et
al., 2005), telephone conversations (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009), YouTube (Filippova, 2012) and chats
in social networks (Peersman et al., 2011). Females tend to use more pronouns, emoticons, emotion
words, and blog words (lol, omg, etc.), while males tend to use more numbers, technology words, and
links (Rao et al., 2010; Bamman et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2013). These differences have also been
exploited to improve sentiment classification (Volkova et al., 2013) and cyberbullying detection (Dadvar
et al., 2012).
To the best of our knowledge, the study by Bamman et al. (2014) is the only computational study that
approaches gender as a social variable. By clustering Twitter users based on their tweets, they show that
multiple gendered styles exist. Unlike their study, we use the crowd and focus on implications for gender
and age prediction.

interface when the user needs to make a guess. Right shows the feedback interface.
Age Eckert (1997) makes a distinction between chronological (number of years since birth), biological
(physical maturity), and social age (based on life events). Most of the studies on language and age
focus on chronological age. However, speakers with the same chronological age can have very different
positions in society, resulting in variation in language use. Computational studies on language use and
age usually focus on automatic (chronological) age prediction. This has typically been modeled as
a classification problem, although this approach often suffers from ad hoc and dataset dependent age
boundaries (Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011). In contrast, recent works also explored predicting age as a
continuous variable and predicting lifestages (Nguyen et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2011) .
Similar to studies on gender prediction, a variety of resources have been used for age prediction, in-
cluding Twitter (Rao et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2013), blogs (Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011; Goswami
et al., 2009), chats in social networks (Peersman et al., 2011) and telephone conversations (Garera and
Yarowsky, 2009). Younger people use more alphabetical lengthening, more capitalization of words,
shorter words and sentences, more self-references, more slang words, and more Internet acronyms
(Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2013; Rao et al., 2010; Goswami et al., 2009; Pen-
nebaker and Stone, 2003; Barbieri, 2008).
3 Data
To study how people perceive the gender and age identity of Twitter users based on their tweets, we
created an online game. Players were asked to guess the gender and age of Twitter users from tweets.
The game was part of a website (TweetGenie, www.tweetgenie.nl) that also hosted an automatic system
that predicts the gender and age of Twitter users based on their tweets (Nguyen et al., 2014). To attract
players, a link to the game was displayed on the page with the results of the automatic prediction, and
visitors were challenged to test if they were better than the automatic system (TweetGenie).
3.1 Twitter Data
We sampled Dutch Twitter users in the fall of 2012. We employed external annotators to annotate the
biological sex and chronological age (in years) using all information available through tweets, the Twitter
profile and external social media profiles such as Facebook and Linkedin. In total over 3000 Twitter users
were annotated. For more details regarding the collection of the dataset we refer to Nguyen et al. (2013).
We divided the data into train and test sets. 200 Twitter users were randomly selected from the test
set to be included in the online game (statistics are shown in Table 1). Named entities were manually
anonymized to conceal the user?s identity. Names in tweets were replaced by ?similar? names (e.g. a
first name common in a certain region in the Netherlands was replaced with another common name in
that region). This was done without knowing the actual gender and age of the Twitter users. Links were
replaced with a general [LINK] token and user mentions with @USER.

3.2 Online Game
Game Setup The interface of the game is shown in Figure 1. Players guessed the biological sex (male
or female) and age (years) of a Twitter user based on only the tweets. For each user, {20, 25, 30, 35,
40} tweets were randomly selected. For a particular Twitter user, the same tweets were displayed to all
players. Twitter users were randomly selected to be displayed to the players.
To include an entertainment element, players received feedback after each guess. They were shown
the correct age and gender, the age and gender guessed by the computer, and the average guessed age
and gender distribution by the other players. In addition, a score was shown of the player versus the
computer.
Collection In May 2013, the game was launched. Media attention resulted in a large number of visitors
(Nguyen et al., 2014). We use the data collected from May 13, 2013 to August 21, 2013, resulting in
a total of 46,903 manual guesses. Players tweeted positively about the game, such as ?@USER Do you
know what is really addictive? ?Are you better than Tweetgenie? ...? and ?@USER Their game is quite
fun!? (tweets translated to English).
We filter sessions that do not seem to contain genuine guesses: when the entered age is 80 years
or above, or 8 or below. These thresholds were based on manual inspection, and chosen because it is
unlikely that the shown tweets are from users of such ages. For each guess, we registered a session ID
and an IP address. A new session started after 2 hours of inactivity. To study player performance more
robustly, we excluded multiple sessions of the same player. After three or more guesses had been made
in a session, all next sessions from the same IP address were discarded.
Statistics Statistics of the data are shown in Table 2. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number of
guesses per session. The longest sessions consisted of 18 guesses. Some of our analyses require multiple
guesses per player. In that case, we only include players having made at least 7 guesses.

We calculate the time taken for a guess by taking the time difference between two guesses (therefore,
no time for the first guess in each session could be measured). For each Twitter user, we calculate the
average time that was taken to guess the gender and age of the user. (Figure 3a). There is a significant
correlation (Pearson?s r = 0.291, p < 0.001) between the average time the players took to evaluate the
tweets of a Twitter user and the number of displayed tweets.
There is also a significant correlation between the average time taken for a user and the entropy over
gender guesses (Pearson?s r = 0.410, p < 0.001), and the average time taken for a user and the standard
deviation of the age guesses (Pearson?s r = 0.408, p < 0.001). Thus, on average, players spent more time
on Twitter users for whom it was more difficult to estimate gender and age.

We observe that as the game progresses, players tend to take less time to make a guess. This is shown
in Figure 3b, which shows the average time taken for a turn (restricted to players with at least 7 guesses).
There was no significant correlation between time spent on a guess and the performance of players and
we did not find trends of performance increase or decrease as players progressed in the game.
3.3 Automatic Prediction
Besides studying human performance, we also compare the predictions of humans with those of an
automatic system. We split the data into train and test sets using the same splits as used by Nguyen et al.
(2013). We train a logistic regression model to predict gender (male or female), and a linear regression
model to predict the age (in years) of a person.
More specifically, given an input vector x ? R
m
, x
1
, . . . , x
m
represent features. In the case of gender
classification (e.g. y ? {?1, 1}), the model estimates a conditional distribution P (y|x, ?) = 1/(1 +
exp(?y(?
0
+ x
>
?))), where ?
0
and ? are the parameters to estimate. Age is treated as a regression
problem, and we find a prediction y? ? R for the exact age of a person y ? R using a linear regression
model: y? = ?
0
+ x
>
?. We use Ridge (also called L
2
) regularization to prevent overfitting.
We make use of the liblinear (Fan et al., 2008) and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) libraries.
We only use unigram features, since they have proven to be very effective for gender (Bamman et al.,
2014; Peersman et al., 2011) and age (Nguyen et al., 2013) prediction. Parameters were tuned using
cross-validation on the training set.
4 Gender
Most of the computational work on language and gender focuses on gender classification, treating gender
as fixed and classifying speakers into females and males. However, this assumes that gender is fixed and
is something people have, instead of something people do (Butler, 1990).
In this section, we first analyze the task difficulty by studying crowd performance on inferring gender
from tweets. We observe a relatively large group of Twitter users who employ language that the crowd
associates with the opposite biological sex. This, then, raises questions about the upper bound that a
prediction system based on only text can achieve.
Next, we place Twitter users on a gender continuum based on the guesses of the players and show that
treating gender as a binary variable is too simplistic. While historically gender has been treated as binary,
researchers in fields such as sociology (Lorber, 1996) and sociolinguistics (Holmes and Meyerhoff, 2003;
Bergvall et al., 1996) find this view too limited. Instead, we assume the simplest extension beyond a
binary variable: a one-dimensional gender continuum (or scale) (Bergvall et al., 1996). For example,
Bergvall (1999) talks about a ?continuum of humans? gendered practices?. While these previous studies
were based on qualitative analyses, we take a quantitative approach using the crowd.
1954
4.1 Task Difficulty
Majority vote We study crowd performance using a system based on the majority of the players?
guesses. Majority voting has proven to be a strong baseline to aggregate votes (e.g. in crowdsourcing
systems (Snow et al., 2008; Le et al., 2010)). On average, we have 210 guesses per Twitter user, providing
substantial evidence per Twitter user. A system based on majority votes achieves an accuracy of 84%
(Table 3a shows a confusion matrix). Table 3b shows a confusion matrix of the majority predictions
versus the automatic system. We find that the biological sex was predicted incorrectly by both the
majority vote system and the automatic system for 21 out of the 200 Twitter users (10.5%, not in Table).
Automatic classification systems on English tweets achieve similar performances as our majority vote
system (e.g. Bergsma and Van Durme (2013) report an accuracy of 87%, Bamman et al. (2014) 88%).
More significantly, the results suggest that 10.5% (automatic + majority) to 16% (majority) of the Dutch
Twitter users do not employ language that the crowd associates with their biological sex. As said, this
raises the question of whether we can expect much higher performances by computational systems based
on only language use.

Individual players versus an automatic system When considering players with 7 or more guesses,
the average accuracy for a player is 0.71. Our automatic system achieves an accuracy of 0.69. The small
number of tweets per Twitter user in our data (20-40) makes it more difficult to automatically predict
gender.
Entropy We characterize the difficulty of inferring a user?s gender by calculating the entropy for each
Twitter user based on the gender guesses (Figure 4a). We find that the difficulty varies widely across
users, and that there are no distinct groups of ?easy? and ?difficult? users. However, we do observe an
interaction effect between the entropy of the gender guesses and the ages of the Twitter users. At an
aggregate level, we find no significant trend. Analyzing females and males separately, we observe a
significant trend with females (Pearson?s r = 0.270, p < 0.01), suggesting that older female Twitter users
tend to emphasize other aspects than their gender in tweets (as perceived by the crowd).

4.2 Binarizing Gender, a Good Approach?
Using data collected through the online game we quantitatively put speakers on a gender continuum
based on how their tweets are perceived by the crowd. For each Twitter user, we calculate the proportion
of players who guessed the users were male and female. A plot is displayed in Figure 4b. We can make
the following observations:
First, the guesses by the players are based on their expectations about what kind of behaviour and
language is used by males and females. The plot shows that for some users, almost all players guessed
the same gender, indicating that these expectations are quite strong and that there are stylistic markers
and topics that the crowd strongly associates with males or females.
Second, if treating gender as a binary variable is reasonable, we would expect to see two distinct
groups. However, we observe quite an overlap between the biological males and females. There are 1)
users who conform to what is expected based on their biological sex, 2) users who deviate from what is
expected, 3) users whose tweets do not emphasize a gender identity or whose tweets have large variation
using language associated with both genders. We investigated whether this is related to their use of
Twitter (professional, personal, or both), but the number of Twitter users in our dataset who used Twitter
professionally was small and not sufficient to draw conclusions.
We now illustrate our findings using examples. The first example is a 15-year old biological female
for who the crowd guessed most strongly that she is female (96% of n=220). Three tweets from her are
shown below. She uses language typically associated with females, talking about spending time with
her girlfriends and the use of stylistic markers such as hearts and alphabetical lengthening. Thus, she
conforms strongly to what the crowd expects from her biological sex.
Tweet 4: Gezellig bij Emily en Charlotte.
Translation: Having fun with Emily and Charlotte.
Tweet 5: Hiiiiii schatjesss!
Translation: Hiiiiii cutiesss!
Tweet 6: ? @USER
Below are two tweets from a 40 year old biological female who does not employ linguistic markers
strongly associated with males or females. Therefore, only 46% of the crowd (n=200) was able to guess
that she is female.
Tweet 7: Ik viel op mijn bek. En het kabinet ook. Geinig toch? #Catshuis
Translation: I went flat on my face. And the cabinet as well. Funny right? #Catshuis
Tweet 8: Jeemig. Ik kan het bijna niet volgen allemaal.
Translation: Jeez. I almost can?t follow it all.
Twitter users vary in how much they emphasize their gender in their tweets. As a result, the difficulty
of inferring gender from tweets varies across persons, and treating gender as a binary variable ignores
much of the interesting variation within and between persons.
Automatic system We now analyze whether an automatic system is capable of capturing the position
of Twitter users on the gender continuum (as perceived by the crowd). We calculate the correlation
between the proportion of male guesses (i.e. the position on the gender continuum) and the scores of
the logistic regression classifier: ?
0
+ x
>
?. While the training data was binary (users were labeled as
male or female), a reasonable Spearman correlation of ? = 0.584 (p < 0.001) was obtained between the
classifier score and the score based on the crowd?s perception. We did not observe a significant relation
between the score of the classifier (corresponding to the confidence of the gender prediction) and age.
1956
5 Age
We start with an analysis of task difficulty, by studying crowd performance on inferring age from tweets.
Next, we show that it is particularly hard to accurately infer the chronological age of older Twitter users
from tweets.
5.1 Task Difficulty
The crowd?s average guesses As with a system based on majority vote for gender prediction, we test
the performance of a system that predicts the ages of Twitter users based on the average of all guesses.
We find that such a system achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.844 years and a Pearson?s
correlation of 0.866. Although the correlation is high, the absolute errors are quite large. We find that the
crowd has difficulty predicting the ages of older Twitter users. There is a positive correlation (Pearson?s
? = 0.789) between the absolute errors and the actual age of Twitter users. There is a negative correlation
between the errors (predicted - actual age) and the actual age of Twitter users (Pearson?s ? = -0.872).
We calculate the standard deviation over all the age guesses for a user (Figure 5a) to measure the
difficulty of inferring a user?s age. There is a positive correlation between age and standard deviation of
the guesses (? = 0.691), which indicates that players have more difficulty in guessing the ages of older
Twitter users.
Individual players versus an Automatic System To estimate the performance of individual players,
we restrict our attention to players with at least 7 guesses. We find that individual players are, on average,
5.754 years off. A linear regression system achieves a MAE of 6.149 years and a Pearson correlation of
0.812. The small number of tweets in our data (20-40) increases the difficulty of the task for automatic
systems.

5.2 Inferring the Age of Older Twitter Users
Figure 5b shows the average player predictions with the actual age of the Twitter users. The red line is
the ?perfect? line, i.e. the line when the predictions would match the exact age. Black represents a fitted
LOESS curve (Cleveland et al., 1992) based on the human predictions. We find that the players tend
to overpredict the age of younger Twitter users, but even more strikingly, on average they consistently
underpredict the age of older Twitter users. The prediction errors already start at the end of the 20s, and
the gap between actual and predicted age increases with age.
This could be explained by sociolinguistic studies that have found that people between 30 and 55 years
use standard forms the most, because they experience the maximum societal pressure in the workplace to
conform (Holmes, 2013). On Twitter, this has been observed as well: Nguyen et al. (2013) found fewer
linguistic differences between older age groups than between younger age groups. This makes it difficult
for the crowd to accurately estimate the ages of older Twitter users. Younger people and retired people
use more non-standard forms (Holmes, 2013). Unfortunately, our dataset does not contain enough retired
users to analyze whether this trend is also present on Twitter.
1957
6 Discussion
We now discuss the implications of our findings for research on automatically predicting the gender and
age of authors from their texts.
Age and gender as social variables Most computational research has treated gender and age as fixed,
biological variables. The dominant approach is to use supervised machine learning methods to generalize
across a large number of examples (e.g. texts written by females and males). While the learned models
so far are effective at predicting age and gender of most people, they learn stereotypical behaviour and
therefore provide a simplistic view.
First, by using the crowd we have shown that Twitter users emphasize their gender and age in varying
degrees and in different ways, so that for example, treating gender as a binary variable is too simplistic
(Butler, 1990; Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013). Many users do not employ the stereotypical language
associated with their biological sex, making models that take a static view of gender ineffective for such
users. More detailed error analyses of the prediction systems will increase understanding of the reasons
for incorrect predictions, and shed light on the relation between language use and social variables.
Second, models that assume static variables will not be able to model the interesting variation (Eisen-
stein, 2013). Models that build on recent developments in sociolinguistics will be more meaningful and
will also have the potential to contribute to new sociolinguistic insights. For example, modeling what
influences speakers to show more or less of their identity through language, or jointly modeling varia-
tion between and within speakers, are in our opinion interesting research directions. The ever increasing
amounts of social media data offer opportunities to explore these research directions.
Sampling We have shown that the difficulty of tasks such as gender and age prediction varies across
persons. Therefore, creating datasets for such tasks requires maximum attention. For example, when
a dataset is biased towards people who show a strong gender identity (e.g. by sampling followers of
accounts highly associated with males or females, such as sororities (Rao et al., 2010)), the results
obtained on such a set may not be representative of a more random set (as observed when classifying
political affiliation (Cohen and Ruths, 2013)).
Task difficulty Our study also raises the question of what level of performance can be obtained for
tasks such as predicting gender and age from only language use. Since we often form an impression
based on someone?s writing, crowd performance is a good indicator of the task difficulty. While the
crowd performance does not need to be the upper bound, it does indicate that it is difficult to predict
gender and age of a large number of Twitter users.
When taking the majority label, only 84% of the users were correctly classified according to their
biological sex. This suggests that about 16% of the Dutch Twitter users do not use language that the
crowd associates with their biological sex.
We also found that it is hard to accurately estimate the ages of older Twitter users, and we related
this to sociolinguistics studies who found less linguistic differences in older age groups due to societal
pressure in the workplace.
Limitations A limitation of our work is that we focused on language variation between persons, and not
on variation within persons. However, speakers vary their language depending on the context and their
conversation partners (e.g. accommodation effects were found in social media (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
et al., 2011)). For example, we assigned Twitter users an overall ?score? by placing them on a gender
continuum, ignoring the variation we find within users.
Crowdsourcing as a tool to understand NLP tasks Most research on crowdsourcing within the NLP
community has focused on how the crowd can be used to obtain fast and large amounts of annotations.
This study is an example of how the crowd can be used to obtain a deeper understanding of an NLP task.
We expect that other tasks where disagreement between annotators is meaningful (i.e. it is not only due
to noise), could potentially benefit from crowdsourcing experiments as well.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated the successful use of the crowd to study the relation between language
use and social variables. In particular, we took a closer look at inferring gender and age from language
using data collected through an online game. We showed that treating gender and age as fixed variables
ignores the variety of ways people construct their identity through language.
Approaching age and gender as social variables will allow for richer analyses and more robust systems.
It has implications ranging from how datasets are created to how results are interpreted. We expect that
our findings also apply to other social variables, such as ethnicity and status. Instead of only focusing on
performance improvement, we encourage NLP researchers to also focus on what we can learn about the
relation between language use and social variables using computational methods.

Abstract
TweetGenie is an online demo that infers the gender and age of Twitter users based on their
tweets. TweetGenie was able to attract thousands of visitors. We collected data by asking feed-
back from visitors and launching an online game. In this paper, we describe the development of
TweetGenie and evaluate the demo based on the received feedback and manual annotation. We
also reflect on practical lessons learned from launching a demo for the general public.
1 Introduction
The language use of speakers is related to variables such as the speaker?s gender and age (Eckert, 1997;
Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013). Systems that can automatically predict such variables have been
receiving increasing attention. They enable more fine-grained analyses of trends by profiling the involved
users. They also support sociolinguistics research by shedding light on the link between variables such
as gender and age, and the language use of speakers.
In this paper, we describe TweetGenie (www.tweetgenie.nl), a website that allows visitors to enter
public Dutch Twitter accounts. The system predicts gender and age of the users behind the entered
accounts based on the 200 most recent tweets. Due to press attention from various media outlets, we
were able to attract a large number of visitors. In comparison to previous gender and age prediction
systems that have been evaluated with carefully constructed datasets, we are the first to evaluate the
performance of such a system ?in the wild?.
We first discuss the development of TweetGenie (Section 2). Next, we study the launch and TweetGe-
nie?s spread through social media, based on log data of the first week after the launch (Section 3). We
then evaluate TweetGenie based on collected feedback (Section 4) and reflect on practical issues we en-
countered while launching an online demo for the general public (Section 5). We end with a conclusion
(Section 6).
2 TweetGenie
In this section we describe the development and setup of TweetGenie.
Goals The original research (Nguyen et al., 2013) was carried out to support analyses of trends and to
study sociolinguistic aspects of language use. By launching a public demo of this research, we aimed
to 1) test the system on a large-scale ?in the wild? 2) collect data, and 3) demo the project to interested
people. Unlike most demos of NLP research, the target audience of this demo was the ?general public?.
For example, we aimed for a simple and attractive interface, and released a press announcement to reach
a large audience.
Model TweetGenie was developed based on the research and dataset described in (Nguyen et al., 2013)
and predicts the gender and age of Dutch Twitter users based on the 200 most recent tweets. First,
unigrams and bigrams are extracted from the tweets using the tokenization tool by O?Connor et al.
(2010). This feature representation was chosen, because it is fast and unigrams have shown to perform

already very well (Nguyen et al., 2013). We then trained logistic (for gender prediction) and linear (for
age prediction) regression models (Pedregosa et al., 2011) with L2 regularization.
Setup TweetGenie is available at www.tweetgenie.nl. After a visitor enters a public Twitter account,
a results page is shown (see Figure 1 for a screenshot). The results page shows the predicted age (in
years), the gender, and a gender ?score? indicating how strong the prediction was (based on x
>
? with
x being the features and ? the estimated parameters). In addition, an option is available to share their
results page on Twitter.
An overview of the components is shown in Figure 3. The first webserver hosts the frontend. A
MySQL database is used to keep track of the progress of each prediction, and to store logs and feed-
back received by users. A second webserver is used to retrieve the data from Twitter and perform the
predictions.
Feedback To collect data and improve the system, users are encouraged to provide feedback on the
predictions. On the page with the automatic prediction (Figure 1), users have the option to enter the
correct age and confirm whether the gender prediction was correct.
Online Game We also developed an online game to study how humans perform on the task. Figure 2
shows a screenshot of the interface. Players are shown 20-40 tweets per Twitter user and have to guess
the gender and age of the Twitter users behind the tweets. After each guess, players receive feedback
in various ways (the correct gender and age, the predictions by the automatic system, and the average
guesses by other players). The data collected proved to be valuable: using the data, we reflected on the
task of inferring gender and age from tweets and the limitations of current systems (Nguyen et al., 2014).

3 Launching TweetGenie
TweetGenie was launched on May 13, 2013 at around 11.30 AM. To reach a large audience, a press
statement was released and messages were posted on social media networks. In this section, we analyze
the data in the first week after the launch.
Figure 3 shows the number of entered Twitter users and the number of tweets mentioning TweetGenie
in the first week after the launch. The number of tweets and the number of users entered follow similar
trends. We observe a high peak in the beginning, but it also rapidly decreases over time. The system
was asked to make a prediction 87,818 times and 9,291 tweets were posted with the word ?TweetGenie?.
1,931 of these tweets were created using the tweet sharing function of TweetGenie. The observed senti-
ment was mostly positive. If TweetGenie made an incorrect prediction, most people joked about it (e.g.
?*grin* I just became 13 years younger without plastic chirurgy #tweetgenie?). The game was played
often as well, a guess was made 31,414 times.

4 Evaluation
We evaluate the system in two ways, 1) using the feedback from users, and 2) using manual annotation.
4.1 Evaluation Based on User Feedback
Visitors were encouraged to give feedback on the predictions of TweetGenie. In the first week, we
received feedback on the gender of 16,563 users and on the age of 17,034 users.
Reliability We randomly sampled 150 Twitter users for which we received feedback on both the gender
and age. We checked the feedback of these users by visiting their Twitter profiles. If the feedback seemed
plausible based on the profile, we assumed the feedback was correct (i.e. we did not visit any other social
media profiles to find the exact age). The results are shown in Table 1. We find that 90% of the feedback
appears to be correct. Only a small fraction (4%) of the feedback was incorrect, this could be deliberate
or due to sloppiness. The remaining feedback was on Twitter accounts of non-Dutch users (e.g. English,
German, French), or accounts that did not represent a person (e.g. a sports team, animal, multiple
persons).
Accuracy We calculate the performance based on the 135 users for who we received correct feedback.
We find that the users who gave feedback are not representative of the general Dutch Twitter population
(Nguyen et al., 2013). The users are older than average (the age distribution is shown in Figure 4). There
are more older males, and more younger females using Twitter in the Netherlands (Nguyen et al., 2013),
and as a consequence the number of males (60.7%) is higher than the number of females (39.3%).
Based on this dataset, we find that the accuracy of the gender predictions was 94%. The Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) for the age predictions is 6.1 years, which is higher than reported in (Nguyen et al., 2013).

Figure 4: Age distribution feedback
However, this can be explained by the observation that relatively many older Twitter users give feedback,
and as discussed in (Nguyen et al., 2013), automatic age predictions for older Twitter users are less
accurate.
4.2 Evaluation Based on Manual Annotation
We also evaluated the system by manually annotating 50 users that were randomly sampled from the
entered users in the logs. We did not include accounts that were not Dutch or did not represent individual
persons. If feedback was available for a Twitter user, we used the provided feedback (after a manual
check). Otherwise, we manually annotated the gender and age using all available information (e.g. social
media profiles, websites). The gender was correctly predicted for 82% of the users, which is lower than
measured in the evaluation based on the user feedback (Section 4.1). The Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
is 6.18 years, which is in line with the observed MAE based on the user feedback.
Our analyses confirm that users for who feedback was available are not representative of all users who
were entered in the system. Of the sampled 50 entered users, the fraction of males and females is almost
equal (52% and 48%) compared to 60.7% and 30.9% in Section 4.1. The number of users who were less
than 20 years old (15) is similar to the number of users in the range of > 20 and? 30 years (17), while in
Section 4.1 the fraction of users below 20 years is smaller. Thus, less feedback was received for younger
Twitter users.
In line with the analysis in Section 4.1, we find that relatively many older Twitter users were entered
into TweetGenie compared to a more representative set of Dutch Twitter users (Nguyen et al., 2013).
5 Lessons Learned
We learned many lessons from launching a demo for the general public.
1) Test all components of the demo. While developing the system, we focused mostly on ensuring
that the backend would be able to handle the number of visitors. However, after the demo went online,
problems arose at the frontend due to the visitor load. This was solved by only allowing a fixed number
of visitors at the same time. We also did not test the interface for non-Dutch visitors. Only later we found
out that the automatically translated version contained serious errors: international visitors were misled
that the model worked on English tweets.
2) The distribution of users trying out the demo might not correspond to the distribution in the devel-
opment dataset. While we extensively evaluated the system on a carefully constructed, representative
dataset (Nguyen et al., 2013), the numbers in this paper?s evaluation are lower. Users who were entered
into the system were not representative of the Dutch Twitter population: relatively more older Twitter
users were entered in the system, leading to more errors in the automic age prediction.
3) A demo is a good opportunity to collect data. Many visitors were willing to provide feedback or
participated in the online game. Data collected through the online game has been used to study the task
of inferring gender and age in more depth (Nguyen et al., 2014). Manual analysis of the feedback in this
paper revealed that almost all of the feedback appears to be genuine. Further research is needed to study
how the feedback on the automatic predictions can be used to improve the prediction models.
65
6 Conclusion
In this paper we discussed TweetGenie, an online system that infers the gender and age of Twitter users
based on tweets alone. We collected much feedback from the users, but also found that users who
provided feedback are not representative of all the entered users. We demonstrated that besides being a
valuable tool for user profiling, TweetGenie also appeals to the general public.

Learning to Extract Folktale Keywords

Abstract
Manually assigned keywords provide a
valuable means for accessing large docu-
ment collections. They can serve as a shal-
low document summary and enable more
efficient retrieval and aggregation of infor-
mation. In this paper we investigate key-
words in the context of the Dutch Folk-
tale Database, a large collection of stories
including fairy tales, jokes and urban leg-
ends. We carry out a quantitative and qual-
itative analysis of the keywords in the col-
lection. Up to 80% of the assigned key-
words (or a minor variation) appear in the
text itself. Human annotators show moder-
ate to substantial agreement in their judg-
ment of keywords. Finally, we evaluate a
learning to rank approach to extract and
rank keyword candidates. We conclude
that this is a promising approach to auto-
mate this time intensive task.
1 Introduction
Keywords are frequently used as a simple way
to provide descriptive metadata about collections
of documents. A set of keywords can concisely
present the most important aspects of a document
and enable quick summaries of multiple docu-
ments. The word cloud in Figure 1, for instance,
gives a quick impression of the most important
topics in a collection of over 40,000 documents (a
collection of Dutch folktales).
Keyword assignment or generation is the task
of finding the most important, topical keywords or
keyphrases to describe a document (Turney, 2000;
Frank et al, 1999). Based on keywords, small
groups of documents (Hammouda et al, 2005) or
large collections of documents (Park et al, 2002)
can be summarized. Keyword extraction is a re-
stricted case of keyword assignment: the assigned
keywords are a selection of the words or phrases
appearing in the document itself (Turney, 2000;
Frank et al, 1999).
In this paper we look into keyword extraction
in the domain of cultural heritage, in particular
for extracting keywords from folktale narratives
found in the Dutch Folktale Database (more on
this collection in section 3). These narratives
might require a different approach for extraction
than in other domains, such as news stories and
scholarly articles (Jiang et al, 2009). Stories in the
Dutch Folktale Database are annotated with un-
controlled, free-text, keywords. Because suggest-
ing keywords which do not appear in the text is a
considerably harder task to automate and to eval-
uate, we restrict ourselves to keywords extracted
from the text itself.
In the first part of this paper we study the cur-
rent practice of keyword assignment for this col-
lection. We analyze the assigned keywords in the
collection as a whole and present a more fine-
grained analysis of a sample of documents. More-
over, we investigate to what extent human anno-
tators agree on suitable keywords extracted from
the text. Manually assigning keywords is an ex-
pensive and time-consuming process. Automatic
assignment would bring down the cost and time to
archive material. In the second part of this paper
we evaluate a number of automatic keyword ex-
traction methods. We show that a learning to rank
approach gives promising results.
The overview of this paper is as follows. We
first describe related work in automatic keyword
assignment. In section 3 we introduce the Dutch
Folktale Database. In section 4 we present an anal-
ysis of the keywords currently used in the folktale
database. In section 5 we investigate the agree-
ment of human annotators on keyword extraction.
In section 6 we present and evaluate an automatic
method for extracting and ranking keywords. We
end with a discussion and conclusion in section 7.

2 Related Work
Because of space limitations, we limit our dis-
cussion of related work to keyword extraction in
the context of free-text indexing. Automated con-
trolled vocabulary indexing is a fundamentally
different task (see for instance Medelyan and Wit-
ten (2006) and Plaunt and Norgard (1998)).
Typically, keyword extraction consists of two
steps. In the first step candidate keywords are de-
termined and features, such as the frequency or
position in the document, are calculated to char-
acterize these keywords. In the second step the
candidates are filtered and ranked based on these
features. Both unsupervised and supervised algo-
rithms have been used to do this.
2.1 Candidate Extraction
Candidate keywords can be extracted in a number
of ways. The simplest approach is to treat each
single word as a candidate keyword, optionally
filtering out stop words or only selecting words
with a particular Part-of-Speech (Liu et al, 2009a;
Jiang et al, 2009). More sophisticated approaches
allow for multi-word keywords, by extracting con-
secutive words from the text, optionally limited to
keywords adhering to specific lexical patterns (Os-
inski and Weiss, 2005; Hulth, 2003; Rose et al,
2010; Frank et al, 1999; Turney, 2000).
2.2 Features to Characterize Keywords
Many features for characterizing candidate key-
words have been investigated previously, with
varying computational complexities and resource
requirements. The simplest features are based
on document and collection statistics, for instance
the frequency of a potential keyword in the doc-
ument and the inverse document frequency in the
collection (Turney, 2000; Hulth, 2003; Frank et
al., 1999). Examples of more complex features
are: features based on characteristics of lexical
chains, requiring a lexical database with word
meanings (Ercan and Cicekli, 2007); features re-
lated to frequencies in external document collec-
tions and query logs (Bendersky and Croft, 2008;
Yih et al, 2006; Liu et al, 2009b; Xu et al, 2010);
and a feature to determine the cohesiveness of re-
trieved documents with that keyword (Bendersky
and Croft, 2008).
2.3 Unsupervised Methods for Keyword
Extraction
Unsupervised methods for keyword extraction
typically rely on heuristics to filter and rank the
keywords in order of importance. For instance,
by ranking the candidates by their importance in
the collection ? estimated by the inverse docu-
ment frequency. Another approach is to apply the
PageRank algorithm to determine the most impor-
tant keywords based on their co-occurrence link-
structure (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). Liu et al
(2009b) employed clustering to extract keywords
that cover all important topics from the original
text. From each topic cluster an exemplar is deter-
mined and for each exemplar the best correspond-
ing keyword is determined.
2.4 Supervised Methods for Keyword
Extraction
Early supervised methods used training data to set
the optimal parameters for (unsupervised) systems
66
based on heuristics (Turney, 2000). Other methods
approached keyword extraction as a binary classi-
fication problem: given a candidate keyword it has
to be classified as either a keyword or not. Meth-
ods include decision trees (Bendersky and Croft,
2008), Naive Bayes (Frank et al, 1999) and Sup-
port Vector Machines (Zhang et al, 2006). Zhang
et al (2008) approached keyword extraction as a
labeling problem for which they employed condi-
tional random fields. Recently, keyword extrac-
tion has been cast as a ranking problem and learn-
ing to rank techniques have been applied to solve
it (Jiang et al, 2009). Jiang et al (2009) concluded
that learning to rank approaches performed better
than binary classifiers in the context of extracting
keywords from scholarly texts and websites. Dif-
ferent variations of learning to rank exist, see (Li,
2011) for an overview.
3 The Dutch Folktale Database
The Dutch Folktale Database is a repository of
over 40,000 folktales in Dutch, old Dutch, Frisian
and a large number of Dutch dialects. The mate-
rial has been collected in the 19th, 20th and 21th
centuries, and consists of stories from various pe-
riods, including the Middle Ages and the Renais-
sance. The collection has both an archival and a
research function. It preserves an important part
of the oral cultural heritage of the Netherlands and
can be used for comparative folk narrative studies.
Since 2004 the database is available online1.
The real value of the database does not only lie
the stories themselves, but also in their manually
added set of descriptive metadata fields. These
fields include, for example, a summary in Dutch,
a list of proper names present in the folktales, and
a list of keywords. Adding these metadata is a
time-consuming and demanding task. In fact, the
amount of work involved hampers the growth of
the folktale database. A large backlog of digitized
folktales is awaiting metadata assignment before
they can be archived in the collection. Being able
to automatically assign keywords to these docu-
ments would be a first step to speed up the archiv-
ing process.
4 Analysis of Assigned Keywords
In this section we analyze the keywords that have
been manually assigned to the stories in the Dutch
Folktale Database. First we look at the keywords

assigned to the collection as a whole. After that we
make a more fine-grained analysis of the keywords
assigned to a selection of the documents.
4.1 Quantitative Analysis
We analyzed a snapshot from the Dutch Folktale
Database (from early 2012) that consists of 41,336
folktales. On average, 15 keywords have been as-
signed to each of these documents (see Figure 2).
The median number of assigned keywords is 10,
however. The keywords vocabulary has 43,195
unique keywords, most of which consist of a sin-
gle word (90%). Figure 1 shows a word cloud
of keywords used in the collection; more frequent
keyword types appear larger. On the right, it lists
the most frequent keyword types (and their trans-
lations). The assignment of keywords to docu-
ments has a Zipfian distribution: a few keyword
types are assigned to many documents, whereas
many keyword types are assigned to few docu-
ments.
When we limit our collection to stories in Dutch
(15,147 documents), we can determine how many
of the manually assigned keywords can be found
literally in the story text2. We define the keyword
coverage of a document as the fraction of its as-
signed keywords which is found in the full text
or its summary. The average keyword coverage
of the Dutch stories is 65%. Figure 3 shows a
histogram of the coverage. It shows that most of
the documents have a keyword coverage of 0.5 or
more.

4.2 Qualitative Analysis
The quantitative analysis does not provide insight
into what kind of keywords have been assigned.
Therefore, we analyzed a selection of documents
more thoroughly. For each of the five largest gen-
res in the collection (fairy tale, traditional legend,
joke, urban legend and riddle) we sampled 10 tales
and manually classified the keywords assigned to
these folktales. A total of almost 1000 keywords
was analyzed. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of
this analysis. Almost 80% of the keywords appear
literally or almost literally in the text. The almost
literal appearances include keywords which differ
in quantity (plural versus singular form) and verb
forms. Verb forms vary in tense (present rather
than past tense) and infinitive keywords of sepa-
rable verbs. An example of the latter is the as-
signment of the keyword ?terugkeren?, to return,
where ?keren? (? turn) and ?terug? (? back) are
used in a sentence. Of the analyzed keywords
5% are synonyms of words appearing the text and
2.3% are hypernyms of words appearing the text
(e.g. ?wapen?, weapon, is used as a keyword with
?mes?, knife, mentioned in the text). The remain-
ing 13% of the keywords represent abstract topic,
event and activity descriptions. For example, the
keyword ?wegsturen?, to send away, when one of
the characters explicitly asks someone to leave.
Other examples are the keywords ?baan?, job, and
?arbeid?, labor, when the story is about an unem-
ployed person.
Based on these numbers we can conclude that
based on extraction techniques alone we should
be able to reproduce a large portion of the manual
keyword assignment. When thesauri are employed
to find synonyms and hypernyms, up to 87% of the
manually assigned keywords could be found. A
much harder task is to obtain the remaining 13%

5 Evaluating Agreement in Keyword
Assignment
The previous analyses raise the question whether
the keywords have been consistently assigned: do
annotators choose the same keywords when pre-
sented with the same text? Moreover, knowing
the difficulty of the task for human annotators will
give us an indication of the level of performance
we may expect from automatic keyword assign-
ment. To determine the agreement between an-
notators we asked ten annotators to classify the
vocabulary of five folktales from different genres.
Frog3 (van den Bosch et al, 2007) was used to
extract the vocabulary of lemmas. After carefully
reading a folktale, the annotator classified the al-
phabetically sorted list of lemmas extracted from
the text. Each lemma was classified as either: 1)
not a relevant keyword ? should not be assigned
to this document (non); 2) a relevant keyword ?
should be assigned (rel); 3) a highly relevant key-
word ? should definitely be assigned (hrel). The
three levels of relevance were used to see whether
annotators have a preference for certain keywords.
The pairwise agreement between annotators was
measured using Cohen?s kappa. Each document
was judged twice, totaling a set of 25 documents.
Most of the annotators were familiar with the folk-
tale database and its keywords; two were active
contributors to the database and thus had previous
experience in assigning keywords to folktales.
On average, the annotators judged 79% of the
vocabulary as non-relevant as keywords. 9% and
12% of the vocabulary was judged as relevant and
highly relevant respectively, but there was a large
variation in these percentages: some annotators
assigned more highly relevant keywords, others
assigned more relevant keywords.

non, rel, hrel 0.48 0.14 0.16 0.77
non, rel + hrel 0.62 0.16 0.25 0.92
non + rel, hrel 0.47 0.20 0.0 0.84
Table 2: Classification agreement between annota-
tors. Non: non-relevant, rel: relevant, hrel: highly
relevant.
The two experienced annotators showed a con-
sistently higher average agreement in comparison
to the other annotators (0.56 and 0.50 for non, rel,
hrel; 0.7 and 0.64 for non, rel + hrel; 0.56 and 0.50
for non + rel, hrel). Moreover, they assigned more
(relevant and highly relevant) keywords to the doc-
uments on average.
Table 2 summarizes the agreement measured
between annotators. The first row indicates the
agreement when considering agreement over all
three classes; the second row indicates the agree-
ment when treating relevant and highly relevant
keywords as the same class; the last row shows
the agreement in indicating the same highly rel-
evant keywords. The numbers indicate moder-
ate agreement between annotators over all three
classes and when considering the choice of highly
relevant keywords. Annotators show substantial
agreement on deciding between non-relevant and
relevant keywords. Table 3 shows the agreement
between annotators on keywords with different
parts of speech (CGN4 tagset). Most disagree-
ments are on nouns, adjectives and verbs. Verbs
and adjectives show few agreements on relevant
and highly relevant keywords. In contrast, on
20% of the nouns annotators agree on their rele-
vance. It appears that the annotators do not agree
whether adjectives and verbs should be used as
keywords at all. We can give three other reasons
why annotators did not agree. First, for longer
stories annotators were presented with long lists
of candidate keywords. Sometimes relevant key-
words might have been simply overlooked. Sec-
ond, it turned out that some annotators selected
some keywords in favor to other keywords (for in-
stance a hyponym rather than a hypernym), where
others simply annotated both as relevant. Third,
the disagreement can be explained by lack of de-
tailed instructions. The annotators were not told
how many (highly) relevant keywords to select or
4Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (Spoken Dutch Corpus),
http://lands.let.kun.nl/cgn/ehome.htm
what criteria should be met by the keywords. Such
instructions are not available to current annotators
of the collection either.
We conclude that annotators typically agree on
the keywords from a text, but have a varying
notion of highly relevant keywords. The aver-
age keywords-based representation strongly con-
denses the documents vocabulary: a document can
be represented by a fifth (21%) of its vocabulary5.
This value can be used as a cut-off point for meth-
ods ranking extracted keywords, discussed here-
after.
6 Automatically Extracting Keywords
In the last part of this paper we look into automati-
cally extracting keywords. We compare a learning
to rank classifier to baselines based on frequency
and reuse in their ability to reproduce keywords
found in manually classified folktales.
In all cases we use the same method for extract-
ing keyword candidates. Since most of the manual
keywords are single words (90% of the used key-
word types in the collection), we simply extract
single words as keyword candidates. We use Frog
for tokenization and part of speech tagging. Stop
words are not removed.
6.1 Baseline Systems
We use a basic unsupervised baseline for keyword
extraction: the words are ranked according to de-
scending TF-IDF. We refer to this system as TF-
IDF. TF, term frequency, and IDF, inverse docu-
ment frequency, are indicators of the term?s local
and global importance and are frequently used in
information retrieval to indicate the relative impor-
tance of a word (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto,
2011).
Note that a word appearing once in the collec-
tion has the highest IDF score. This would imply
that the most uncommon words are also the most
important resulting in a bias towards spelling er-
rors, proper names, and other uncommon words.
Hence, our second baseline takes into account
whether a keyword has been used before in a train-
ing set. Again, the candidates are ranked by de-
scending TF-IDF, but now keywords appearing in
the training collection are ranked above the key-
words not appearing in the collection. We refer to
this baseline as TF-IDF-T.

lary is judged as relevant and 12% as highly relevant

are column-wise percentages. Tags with full agreement are not shown.
6.2 Learning to Rank Keywords
Following Jiang et al (2009) we apply a learn-
ing to rank technique to rank the list of extracted
keywords. We train an SVM to classify the rel-
ative ordering of pairs of keywords. Words cor-
responding to manual keywords should be ranked
higher than other words appearing in the docu-
ment. We use SVM-rank to train a linear ranking
SVM (Joachims, 2006). We use the following fea-
tures.
6.2.1 Word Context
We use the following word context features:
starts uppercase: indicates whether the token
starts with an uppercase letter (1) or not (0). Since
proper names are not used as keywords in the folk-
tale database, this feature is expected to be a neg-
ative indicator of a word being a keyword.
contains space: indicates whether the token con-
tains a space (Frog extracts some Dutch multi-
word phrases as a single token). Tokens with
spaces are not very common.
is number: indicates whether the token consists
of only digits. Numbers are expected not to be a
keyword.
contains letters: indicates whether the token con-
tains at least a single letter. Keywords are expected
to contain letters.
all capital letters: indicates whether the token
consists of only capital letters. Words with only
capital letters are not expected to be keywords.
single letter: indicates whether the token consists
of only one letter. One letter keywords are very
uncommon.
contains punctuation: indicates whether the to-
ken contains punctuation such as apostrophes.
Keywords are expected not to contain punctuation.
part of speech: indicates the part of speech of
the token (each tag is a binary feature). Nouns
are expected to be a positive indicator of key-
words (Jiang et al, 2009).
6.2.2 Document Context
We use the following document context features:
tf: the term frequency indicates the number of ap-
pearances of the word divided by the total number
of tokens in the document.
first offset: indicates the offset of the word?s
first appearance in the document, normalized by
the number of tokens in the document (follow-
ing Zhang et al (2008)). Important (key)words are
expected to be mentioned early.
first sentence offset: indicates the offset of the
first sentence in which the token appears, normal-
ized by the number of sentences in the document.
sentence importance: indicates the maxi-
mum importance of a sentence in which the
word appears, as measured by the SumBasic
score (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005). Sum-
Basic determines the relative importance of sen-
tences solely on word probability distributions in
the text.
dispersion: indicates the dispersion or scattering
of the word in the document. Words which are
highly dispersed are expected to be more impor-
tant. The DPnorm is used as a dispersion measure,
proposed in Gries (2008).
6.2.3 Collection Context
We use the following features from the collec-
tion/training context:
idf: the inverse document frequency indicates the
collection importance of the word based on fre-
quency: frequent terms in the collection are less
important than rare terms in the collection.
tf.idf: combines the tf and idf features by multi-
plying them. It indicates a trade-off between local
and global word importance.
is training keyword: indicates whether the word
is used in the training collection as a keyword.
assignment ratio: indicates the percentage of
documents in which the term is present in the text
and in which it is also assigned as a keyword.
70
6.3 Evaluation Method
We evaluate the ranking methods on their ability
to reproduce the manual assignment of keywords.
Ideally the ranking methods rank these manual
keywords highest. We measure the effectiveness
of ranking in terms of (mean) average precision
(MAP), precision at rank 5 (P@5) and precision at
rank R (P@R), similar to Jiang et al (2009). Note
that we use all the manually assigned keywords
as a ground truth, including words which do not
occur in the text itself. This lowers the highest
achievable performance, but it will give a better
idea of the performance for the real task.
We perform a 10-fold stratified cross-validation
with a set of 10,900 documents from the Dutch
Folktale Database, all written in modern Dutch.
6.4 Results
Table 4 lists the performance of the three tested
systems. The TF-IDF system performs worst,
and is significantly outperformed by the TF-IDF-
T system, which in turn is significantly outper-
formed by the rank-SVM system. On average,
rank-SVM returns 3 relevant keywords in its top
5. The reported mean average precision values
are affected by manual keywords which are not
present in the text itself. To put these numbers
in perspective: if we would put the manual key-
words which are in the text in an optimal ranking,
i.e. return these keywords first, we would achieve
an upper bound mean average precision of 0.5675.
Taking into account the likelihood that some of
the highly ranked false positives are relevant af-
ter all (the annotator might have missed a relevant
keyword) and considering the difficulty of the task
(given the variation in agreement between manual
annotators), we argue that the rank-SVM performs
quite well.
Jiang et al (2009) reported MAPs of 0.288 and
0.503 on the ranking of extracted keyphrases from
scholarly articles and tags from websites respec-
tively. Based on these numbers, we could argue
that assigning keywords to folktales is harder than
reproducing the tags of websites, and slightly eas-
ier than reproducing keyphrases from scientific ar-
ticles. Because of differences in the experimental
setup (e.g. size of the training set, features and
system used), it is difficult to make strong claims
on the difficulty of the task.

6.5 Feature Ablation
To determine the added value of the individual fea-
tures we carried out an ablation study. Table 5
lists the changes in performance when leaving out
a particular feature (or group of features in case
of part of speech). It turns out that many features
can be left out without hurting the performance.
All the features testing simple word characteristics
(such as single letter) do not, or only marginally
influence the results. Also taking into account the
importance of sentences (sentence importance), or
the first appearance of a word (first offset and first
sentence offset) does not contribute to the results.

pendent t-test, p-value < 0.01)
These observations suggest that almost identi-
cal results can be obtained using only the features
assignment ratio, tf.idf, part of speech and disper-
sion. The results reported in Table 6 confirm this
(we do note that these results were obtained by op-
timizing on the test set).
6.6 Performance on Folktale Genres
The folktale database contains stories from differ-
ent folktale genres, varying from legends to fairy
tales and jokes. Table 7 lists the performance mea-
sures per story genre. Values in bold indicate sig-
nificant differences with the stories from the other
genres combined. The performance on traditional
legends turns out to be significantly better than
other genres: this could be explained by the fact
that on average these stories are longer and there-
fore contain more keywords. Similarly, the de-
crease can be explained for jokes, which are much
shorter on average. Another explanation could be
that more abstract keywords are used to indicate
the type of joke. Interestingly, the riddles, which
are even shorter than jokes, do not perform sig-
nificantly worse than the other genres. Personal
narratives also underperformed in comparison to
the other genres. We cannot readily explain this,
but we suspect it may have something to do with
the fact that personal narratives are more varied in
content and contain more proper names.
7 Discussion and Conclusion
In this work we analyzed keywords in the context
of the Dutch Folktale Database. In this database,
on average 15 keywords have been assigned to a
story, many of which are single keywords which
appear literally or almost literally in the text itself.
Keyword annotators show moderate to substantial
agreement in extracting the same keywords for a
story. We showed that a learning to rank method
using features based on assignment ratio, tf.idf,
part of speech and dispersion can be effectively
used to extract and rank keyword candidates. We
believe that this system can be used to suggest
highly relevant keyword candidates to human an-
notators to speed up the archiving process.
In our evaluation we aimed to reproduce the
manual annotations, but it is unclear whether bet-
ter performing systems are actually more helpful
to the user. In an ad hoc retrieval scenario, in
which the user issues a single query and reviews
a list of retrieved documents, extracted keywords
might be used to boost the early precision of the
results. However, a user might not even notice
a difference when a different keyword extraction
system is used. Moreover, the more abstract key-
words which do not appear in the text might be
more important for the user experience. In fu-
ture work we want to get insight in how keywords
contribute to the end user experience. Ideally, the
evaluation should directly measure how useful the
various keywords are for accessing the collection.
In this work we considered only extracting key-
words from the text we want to annotate. Given
the multilingual content of the database this is a
limited approach: if the goal of assigning key-
words is to obtain a normalized representation of
the stories, this approach will require translation
of either the source text (before extraction) or the
extracted keywords. Even in the monolingual sce-
nario, the extraction of keywords is limited in deal-
ing with differences in style and word use. Writers
may use different words or use words in a differ-
ent way; ideally the representation based on key-
words is a normalized representation which closes
this semantic gap. In future work we will look into
annotation with keywords from multi-lingual the-
sauri combined with free-text keywords extracted
from the text itself. Finally, we want to look into
classification of abstract themes and topics.
