Abstract
Mixture modelling is a standard technique
for density estimation, but its use in sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) has just
started to be explored. One of the main
advantages of this technique is its capabil-
ity to learn specific probability distributions
that better fit subsets of the training dataset.
This feature is even more important in SMT
given the difficulties to translate polysemic
terms whose semantic depends on the con-
text in which that term appears. In this pa-
per, we describe a mixture extension of the
HMM alignment model and the derivation of
Viterbi alignments to feed a state-of-the-art
phrase-based system. Experiments carried
out on the Europarl and News Commentary
corpora show the potential interest and limi-
tations of mixture modelling.
1 Introduction
Mixture modelling is a popular approach for density
estimation in many scientific areas (G. J. McLach-
lan and D. Peel, 2000). One of the most interest-
ing properties of mixture modelling is its capability
to model multimodal datasets by defining soft parti-
tions on these datasets, and learning specific proba-
bility distributions for each partition, that better ex-
plains the general data generation process.

In Machine Translation (MT), it is common to
encounter large parallel corpora devoted to hetero-
geneous topics. These topics usually define sets
of topic-specific lexicons that need to be translated
taking into the semantic context in which they are
found. This semantic dependency problem could
be overcome by learning topic-dependent translation
models that capture together the semantic context
and the translation process.
However, there have not been until very recently
that the application of mixture modelling in SMT
has received increasing attention. In (Zhao and
Xing, 2006), three fairly sophisticated bayesian top-
ical translation models, taking IBM Model 1 as a
baseline model, were presented under the bilingual
topic admixture model formalism. These models
capture latent topics at the document level in order to
reduce semantic ambiguity and improve translation
coherence. The models proposed provide in some
cases better word alignment and translation quality
than HMM and IBM models on an English-Chinese
task. In (Civera and Juan, 2006), a mixture exten-
sion of IBM model 2 along with a specific dynamic-
programming decoding algorithm were proposed.
This IBM-2 mixture model offers a significant gain
in translation quality over the conventional IBM
model 2 on a semi-synthetic task.
In this work, we present a mixture extension of the
well-known HMM alignment model first proposed
in (Vogel and others, 1996) and refined in (Och and
Ney, 2003). This model possesses appealing proper-
ties among which are worth mentioning, the simplic-
ity of the first-order word alignment distribution that
can be made independent of absolute positions while
177
taking advantage of the localization phenomenon
of word alignment in European languages, and the
efficient and exact computation of the E-step and
Viterbi alignment by using a dynamic-programming
approach. These properties have made this model
suitable for extensions (Toutanova et al, 2002)
and integration in a phrase-based model (Deng and
Byrne, 2005) in the past.
2 HMM alignment model
Given a bilingual pair (x, y), where x and y are mu-
tual translation, we incorporate the hidden variable
a = a1a2 ? ? ? a|x| to reveal, for each source word po-
sition j, the target word position aj ? {0, 1, . . . , |y|}
to which it is connected. Thus,
p(x | y) =
?
a?A(x,y)
p(x, a | y) (1)
where A(x, y) denotes the set of all possible align-
ments between x and y. The alignment-completed
probability P (x, a | y) can be decomposed in terms
of source position-dependent probabilities as:
p(x, a | y)=
|x|?
j=1
p(aj | a
j?1
1 , x
j?1
1 , y) p(xj | a
j
1, x
j?1
1 , y)
(2)
The original formulation of the HMM alignment
model assumes that each source word is connected
to exactly one target word. This connection depends
on the target position to which was aligned the pre-
vious source word and the length of the target sen-
tence. Here, we drop both dependencies in order to
simplify to a jump width alignment probability dis-
tribution:
p(aj | a
j?1
1 , x
j?1
1 , y) ?
{
p(aj) j = 1
p(aj?aj?1) j > 1
(3)
p(xj | a
j
1, x
j?1
1 , y) ? p(xj | yaj ) (4)
Furthermore, the treatment of the NULL word is
the same as that presented in (Och and Ney, 2003).
Finally, the HMM alignment model is defined as:
p(x | y) =
?
a?A(x,y)
p(a1)
|x|?
j=2
p(aj?aj?1)
|x|?
j=1
p(xj |yaj )
(5)
3 Mixture of HMM alignment models
Let us suppose that p(x | y) has been generated using
a T-component mixture of HMM alignment models:
p(x | y) =
T?
t=1
p(t | y) p(x | y, t)
=
T?
t=1
p(t | y)
?
a?A(x,y)
p(x, a | y, t) (6)
In Eq. 6, we introduce mixture coefficients p(t | y)
to weight the contribution of each HMM alignment
model in the mixture. While the term p(x, a | y, t) is
decomposed as in the original HMM model.
The assumptions of the constituent HMM mod-
els are the same than those of the previous section,
but we obtain topic-dependent statistical dictionaries
and word alignments. Apropos of the mixture coef-
ficients, we simplify these terms dropping its depen-
dency on y, leaving as future work its inclusion in
the model. Formally, the assumptions are:
p(t | y) ? p(t) (7)
p(aj | a
j?1
1 , x
j?1
1 , y, t)?
{
p(aj | t) j=1
p(aj?aj?1 | t)j>1
(8)
p(xj | a
j
1, x
j?1
1 , y, t) ? p(xj | yaj , t) (9)
Replacing the assumptions in Eq. 6, we obtain the
(incomplete) HMM mixture model as follows:
p(x | y) =
T?
t=1
p(t)
?
a?A(x,y)
p(a1 | t)?
?
|x|?
j=2
p(aj?aj?1 | t)
|x|?
j=1
p(xj |yaj , t) (10)
and the set of unknown parameters comprises:
~? =
?
???
???
p(t) t = 1 . . . T
p(i | t) j = 1
p(i? i? | t) j > 1
p(u | v, t) ?u ? X and v ? Y
(11)
X and Y , being the source and target vocabular-
ies.
The estimation of the unknown parameters in
Eq. 10 is troublesome, since topic and alignment
178
data are missing. Here, we revert to the EM opti-
misation algoritm to compute these parameters.
In order to do that, we define the complete version
of Eq. 10 incorporating the indicator variables zt and
za, uncovering, the until now hidden variables. The
variable zt is a T -dimensional bit vector with 1 in
the position corresponding to the component gener-
ating (x, y) and zeros elsewhere, while the variable
za = za1 . . . za|x| where zaj is a |y|-dimensional bit
vector with 1 in the position corresponding to the tar-
get position to which position j is aligned and zeros
elsewhere. Then, the complete model is:
p(x, zt, za | y) ?
T?
t=1
p(t)zt
|y|?
i=1
p(i | t)za1izt?
?
|x|?
j=1
|y|?
i=1
p(xj | yi, t)
zajizt
|y|?
i?=1
p(i? i? | t)
zaj?1i? zajizt
(12)
Given the complete model, the EM algorithm
works in two basic steps in each iteration: the
E(xpectation) step and the M(aximisation) step. At
iteration k, the E step computes the expected value
of the hidden variables given the observed data
(x, y) and the estimate of the parameters ~?(k).
The E step reduces to the computation of the ex-
pected value of zt, zajizt and zaj?1i?zajizt for each
sample n:
zt ? p(t)
|y|?
i=1
?|x|it (13)
zajizt = zajit zt (14)
zaj?1i?zajizt = (zaj?1i?zaji)t zt (15)
where
zajit?
|y|?
k=1
?jkt?jkt
(zaj?1i?zaji)t??j?1it p(i? i
? | t) p(xj |yi, t)?jit
and the recursive functions ? and ? defined as:
?jit =
?
?
?
p(i | t) p(xj | yi, t) j = 1
|y|?
k=1
?j?1kt p(i? k | t) p(xj | yi, t) j > 1
?jit =
?
?
?
1 j = |x|
|y|?
k=1
p(k ? i | t) p(xj+1 | yk, t)?j+1kt j < |x|
The M step finds a new estimate of ~?, by max-
imising Eq. 12, using the expected value of the miss-
ing data from Eqs. 13,14 and 15 over all sample n:
p(t) =
1

3.1 Word alignment extraction
The HMM mixture model described in the previous
section was used to generate Viterbi alignments on
the training dataset. These optimal alignments are
the basis for phrase-based systems.
In the original HMM model, the Viterbi align-
ment can be efficiently computed by a dynamic-
programming algorithm with a complexity O(|x| ?
|y|2). In the mixture HMM model, we approximate
the Viterbi alignment by maximising over the com-
ponents of the mixture:
a? ? argmax
a
max
t
p(t) p(x, a | y, t)
So we have that the complexity of the compu-
tation of the Viterbi alignment in a T-component
HMM mixture model is O(T ? |x| ? |y|2).
4 Experimental results
The data that was employed in the experiments to
train the HMM mixture model corresponds to the
concatenation of the Spanish-English partitions of
the Europarl and the News Commentary corpora.
The idea behind this decision was to let the mixture
model distinguish which bilingual pairs should con-
tribute to learn a given HMM component in the mix-
ture. Both corpora were preprocessed as suggested
for the baseline system by tokenizing, filtering sen-
tences longer than 40 words and lowercasing.
Regarding the components of the translation sys-
tem, 5-gram language models were trained on the
monolingual version of the corpora for English(En)
179
and Spanish(Es), while phrase-based models with
lexicalized reordering model were trained using the
Moses toolkit (P. Koehn and others, 2007), but re-
placing the Viterbi alignments, usually provided by
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), by those of the HMM
mixture model with training scheme mix 15H5.
This configuration was used to translate both test de-
velopment sets, Europarl and News Commentary.
Concerning the weights of the different models,
we tuned those weights by minimum error rate train-
ing and we employed the same weighting scheme
for all the experiments in the same language pair.
Therefore, the same weighting scheme was used
over different number of components.
BLEU scores are reported in Tables 1 and 2 as a
function of the number of components in the HMM
mixture model on the preprocessed development test
sets of the Europarl and News Commentary corpora.
Table 1: BLEU scores on the Europarl development
test data
T 1 2 3 4
En-Es 31.27 31.08 31.12 31.11
Es-En 31.74 31.70 31.80 31.71
Table 2: BLEU scores on the News-Commentary
development test data
T 1 2 3 4
En-Es 29.62 30.01 30.17 29.95
Es-En 29.15 29.22 29.11 29.02
As observed in Table 1, if we compare the BLEU
scores of the conventional single-component HMM
model to those of the HMM mixture model, it seems
that there is little or no gain from incorporating
more topics into the mixture for the Europarl cor-
pus. However, in Table 2, the BLEU scores on
the English-Spanish pair significantly increase as the
number of components is incremented. We believe
that this is due to the fact that the News Commen-
tary corpus seems to have greater influence on the
mixture model than on the single-component model,
specializing Viterbi alignments to favour this corpus.
5 Conclusions and future work
In this work, a novel mixture version of the HMM
alignment model was introduced. This model was
employed to generate topic-dependent Viterbi align-
ments that were input into a state-of-the-art phrase-
based system. The preliminary results reported on
the English-Spanish partitions of the Europarl and
News-Commentary corpora may raise some doubts
about the applicability of mixture modelling to SMT,
nonetheless in the advent of larger open-domain cor-
pora, the idea behind topic-specific translation mod-
els seem to be more than appropriate, necessary. On
the other hand, we are fully aware that indirectly
assessing the quality of a model through a phrase-
based system is a difficult task because of the differ-
ent factors involved (Ayan and Dorr, 2006).
Finally, the main problem in mixture modelling is
the linear growth of the set of parameters as the num-
ber of components increases. In the HMM, and also
in IBM models, this problem is aggravated because
of the use of statistical dictionary entailing a large
number of parameters. A possible solution is the im-
plementation of interpolation techniques to smooth
sharp distributions estimated on few events (Och and
Ney, 2003; Zhao and Xing, 2006).

Abstract
We present minimum Bayes-risk system com-
bination, a method that integrates consen-
sus decoding and system combination into
a unified multi-system minimum Bayes-risk
(MBR) technique. Unlike other MBR meth-
ods that re-rank translations of a single SMT
system, MBR system combination uses the
MBR decision rule and a linear combina-
tion of the component systems? probability
distributions to search for the minimum risk
translation among all the finite-length strings
over the output vocabulary. We introduce ex-
pected BLEU, an approximation to the BLEU
score that allows to efficiently apply MBR in
these conditions. MBR system combination is
a general method that is independent of spe-
cific SMT models, enabling us to combine
systems with heterogeneous structure. Exper-
iments show that our approach bring sig-
nificant improvements to single-system-based
MBR decoding and achieves comparable re-
sults to different state-of-the-art system com-
bination methods.
1 Introduction
Once statistical models are trained, a decoding ap-
proach determines what translations are finally se-
lected. Two parallel lines of research have shown
consistent improvements over the max?derivation
decoding objective, which selects the highest prob-
ability derivation. Consensus decoding procedures
select translations for a single system with a mini-
mum Bayes risk (MBR) (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).
System combination procedures, on the other hand,
generate translations from the output of multiple
component systems by combining the best frag-
ments of these outputs (Frederking and Nirenburg,
1994). In this paper, we present minimum Bayes
risk system combination, a technique that unifies
these two approaches by learning a consensus trans-
lation over multiple underlying component systems.
MBR system combination operates directly on the
outputs of the component models. We perform an
MBR decoding using a linear combination of the
component models? probability distributions. In-
stead of re-ranking the translations provided by the
component systems, we search for the hypothesis
with the minimum expected translation error among
all the possible finite-length strings in the target lan-
guage. By using a loss function based on BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al, 2002), we avoid the hypothesis align-
ment problem that is central to standard system com-
bination approaches (Rosti et al, 2007). MBR sys-
tem combination assumes only that each translation
model can produce expectations of n-gram counts;
the latent derivation structures of the component sys-
tems can differ arbitrary. This flexibility allows us to
combine a great variety of SMT systems.
The key contributions of this paper are three: the
usage of a linear combination of distributions within
the MBR decoding, which allows multiple SMT
models to be involved in, and makes the computa-
tion of n-grams statistics to be more accurate; the
decoding in an extended search space, which allows
to find better hypotheses than the evidences pro-
vided by the component models; and the use of an
expected BLEU score instead of the sentence-wise
BLEU, which allows to efficiently apply MBR de-
coding in the huge search space under consideration.
We evaluate in a multi-source translation task ob-
taining improvements of up to +2.0 BLEU abs. over
the best single system max-derivation, and state-of-
the-art performance in the system combination task
of the ACL 2010 workshop on SMT.

2 Related Work
MBR system combination is a multi-system gener-
alization of MBR decoding where the space of hy-
potheses is not constrained to the space of evidences.
We expand the space of hypotheses following some
underlying ideas of system combination techniques.
2.1 Minimum Bayes risk
In SMT, MBR decoding allows to minimize the
loss of the output for a single translation system.
MBR is generally implemented by re-ranking an N -
best list of translations produced by a first pass de-
coder (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). Different tech-
niques to widen the search space have been de-
scribed (Tromble et al, 2008; DeNero et al, 2009;
Kumar et al, 2009; Li et al, 2009). These works
extend the traditional MBR algorithms based on N -
best lists to work with lattices.
The use of MBR to combine the outputs of vari-
ous MT systems has also been explored previously.
Duan et al (2010) present an MBR decoding that
makes use of a mixture of different SMT systems to
improve translation accuracy. Our technique differs
in that we use a linear combination instead of a mix-
ture, which avoids the problem of component sys-
tems not sharing the same search space; perform the
decoding in a search space larger than the outputs
of the component models; and optimize an expected
BLEU score instead of the linear approximation to
it described in (Tromble et al, 2008).
DeNero et al (2010) present model combination,
a multi-system lattice MBR decoding on the con-
joined evidences spaces of the component systems.
Our technique differs in that we perform the search
in an extended search space not restricted to the pro-
vided evidences, have fewer parameters to learn, and
optimizes an expected BLEU score instead of the
linear BLEU approximation.
Another MBR-related technique to combine the
outputs of various MT systems was presented by
Gonza?lez-Rubio and Casacuberta (2010). They use
different median string (Fu, 1982) algorithms to
combine various machine translation systems. Our
approach differs in that we take into account the pos-
terior distribution over translations instead of con-
sidering each translation equally likely, optimize the
expected BLEU score instead of a sentence-wise
measure such as the edit distance or the sentence-
level BLEU, and take into account the quality dif-
ferences by associating a tunable scaling factor to
each system.
2.2 System Combination
System combination techniques in MT take as in-
put the outputs {e1, ? ? ? , eN} of N translation sys-
tems, where en is a structured translation object
(or N -best lists thereof), typically viewed as a se-
quence of words. The dominant approach in the
field chooses a primary translation ep as a backbone,
then finds an alignment an to the backbone for each
en. A new search space is constructed from these
backbone-aligned outputs and then a voting proce-
dure of feature-based model predicts a final consen-
sus translation (Rosti et al, 2007). MBR system
combination entirely avoids this alignment prob-
lem by considering hypotheses as n-gram occur-
rence vectors rather than word sequences. MBR sys-
tem combination performs the decoding in a larger
search space and includes statistics from the compo-
nents? posteriors, whereas system combination tech-
niques typically do not.
Despite these advantages, system combination
may be more appropriate in some settings. In par-
ticular, MBR system combination is designed pri-
marily for statistical systems that generate N -best
or lattice outputs. MBR system combination can in-
tegrate non-statistical systems that generate either a
single or an unweighted output. However, we would
not expect the same strong performance from MBR
system combination in these constrained settings.
3 Minimum Bayes risk Decoding
MBR decoding aims to find the candidate hypothesis
that has the least expected loss under a probability
model (Bickel and Doksum, 1977). We begin with a
review of MBR for SMT.
SMT can be described as a mapping of a word se-
quence f in a source language to a word sequence
e in a target language; this mapping is produced by
the MT decoder D(f). If the reference translation
e is known, the decoder performance can be mea-
sured by the loss function L(e,D(f)). Given such a
loss function L(e, e?) between an automatic transla-
tion e? and a reference e, and an underlying proba-
1269
bility model P (e|f), MBR decoding has the follow-
ing form (Goel and Byrne, 2000; Kumar and Byrne,
2004):
e? = arg min
e??E
R(e?) (1)
= arg min
e??E
?
e?E
P (e|f) ? L(e, e?) , (2)
where R(e?) denotes the Bayes risk of candidate
translation e? under loss function L, and E repre-
sents the space of translations.
If the loss function between any two hypotheses
can be bounded: L(e, e?) ? Lmax, the MBR de-
coder can be rewritten in term of a similarity func-
tion S(e, e?) = Lmax ? L(e, e?). In this case, in-
stead of minimizing the Bayes risk, we maximize
the Bayes gain G(e?):
e? = arg max
e??E
G(e?) (3)
= arg max
e??E
?
e?E
P (e|f) ? S(e, e?) . (4)
MBR decoding can use different spaces for hy-
pothesis selection and gain computation (arg max
and summatory in Eq. (4)). Therefore, the MBR de-
coder can be more generally written as follows:
e? = arg max
e??Eh
?
e?Ee
P (e|f) ? S(e, e?) , (5)
where Eh refers to the hypotheses space form where
the translations are chosen and Ee refers to the evi-
dences space that is used to compute the Bayes gain.
We will investigate the expansion of the hypotheses
space while keeping the evidences space as provided
by the decoder.
4 MBR System Combination
MBR system combination is a multi-system gener-
alization of MBR decoding. It uses the MBR de-
cision rule on a linear combination of the probabil-
ity distributions of the component systems. Unlike
existing MBR decoding methods that re-rank trans-
lation outputs, MBR system combination search for
the minimum risk hypotheses on the complete set of
finite-length hypotheses over the output vocabulary.
We assume the component systems to be statistically
independent and define the Bayes gain as a linear
combination of the Bayes gains of the components.
Each system provides its own space of evidences
Dn(f) and its posterior distribution over translations
Pn(e|f). Given a sentence f in the source language,
MBR system combination is written as follows:
e? = arg max
e??Eh
G(e?) (6)
? arg max
e??Eh
N?
n=1
?n ? Gn(e?) (7)
= arg max
e??Eh
N?
n=1
?n ?
?
e?Dn(f)
Pn(e|f) ? S(e, e?) , (8)
where N is the total number of component systems,
Eh represents the hypotheses space where the search
is performed, Gn(e?) is the Bayes gain of hypothe-
sis e? given by the nth component system and ?n is
a scaling factor introduced to take into account the
differences in quality of the component models. It is
worth mentioning that by using a linear combination
instead of a mixture model, we avoid the problem
of component systems not sharing the same search
space (Duan et al, 2010).
MBR system combination parameters training
and decoding in the extended hypotheses space are
described below.
4.1 Model Training
We learn the scaling factors in Eq. (8) using min-
imum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).
MERT maximizes the translation quality of e? on a
held-out set, according to an evaluation metric that
compares to a reference set. We used BLEU, choos-
ing the scaling factors to maximize BLEU score
of the set of translations predicted by MBR sys-
tem combination. We perform the maximization by
means of the down-hill simplex algorithm (Nelder
and Mead, 1965).
4.2 Model Decoding
In most MBR algorithms, the hypotheses space is
equal to the evidences space. Following the underly-
ing idea of system combination, we are interested in
extend the hypotheses space by including new sen-
tences created using fragments of the hypotheses in
the evidences spaces of the component models. We
perform the search (argmax operation in Eq. (8))

rithm (Mart??nez et al, 2000). AMS algorithm per-
form a search on a hypotheses space equal to the
free monoid ?? of the vocabulary of the evidences
? = V oc(Ee).
The AMS algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.
AMS starts with an initial hypothesis e that is mod-
ified using edit operations until there is no improve-
ment in the Bayes gain (Lines 3?16). On each posi-
tion j of the current solution ecur, we apply all the
possible single edit operations: substitution of the
jth word of ecur by each word a in the vocabulary
(Lines 5?9), deletion of the jth word of ecur (Line
10) and insertion of each word a in the vocabulary in
the jth position of ecur (Lines 11?15). If the Bayes
gain of any of the new edited hypotheses is higher
than the Bayes gain of the current hypothesis (Line
17), we repeat the loop with this new hypotheses e?,
in other case, we return the current hypothesis.
AMS algorithm takes as input an initial hypothe-
sis e and the combined vocabulary of the evidences
spaces ?. Its output is a possibly new hypothesis
whose Bayes gain is assured to be higher or equal
than the Bayes gain of the initial hypothesis.
The complexity of the main loop (lines 2-17) is
O(|ecur| ? |?| ? CG), where CG is the cost of com-
puting the gain of a hypothesis, and usually only a
moderate number of iterations (< 10) is needed to
converge (Mart??nez et al, 2000).
5 Computing BLEU-based Gain
We are interested in performing MBR system com-
bination under BLEU. BLEU behaves as a score
function: its value ranges between 0 and 1 and a
larger value reflects a higher similarity. Therefore,
we rewrite the gain function G(?) using single evi-
dence (or reference) BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002)
as the similarity function:
Gn(e?) =
?
e?Dn(f)
Pn(e|f) ? BLEU(e, e?) (9)
BLEU =
4?
k=1
(
mk
ck
) 1
4
?min
(
e1?
r
c , 1.0
)
, (10)
where r is the length of the evidence, c the length of
the hypothesis, mk the number of n-gram matches
of size k, and ck the count of n-grams of size k in
the hypothesis.
The evidences space Dn(f) may contain a huge
number of hypotheses1 which often make impracti-
cal to compute Eq. (9) directly. To avoid this prob-
lem, Tromble et al (2008) propose linear BLEU, an
approximation to the BLEU score to efficiently per-
form MBR decoding when the search space is repre-
sented with lattices. However, our hypotheses space
is the full set of finite-length strings in the target vo-
cabulary and can not be represented in a lattice.
In Eq. (9), we have one hypothesis e? that is to be
compared to a set of evidences e ? Dn(f) which
follow a probability distribution Pn(e|f). Instead
of computing the expected BLEU score by calcu-
lating the BLEU score with respect to each of the
evidences, our approach will be to use the expected
n-gram counts and sentence length of the evidences
to compute a single-reference BLEU score. We re-
place the reference statistics (r and mn in Eq. (10))
by the expected statistics (r? and m?n) given the pos-

where Nk(e?) is the set of n-grams of size k in the
hypothesis, Ce?(ng) is the count of the n-gram ng in
the hypothesis and C ?(ng) is the expected count of
ng in the evidences. To compute the n-gram match-
ings m?k, the count of each n-gram is truncated, if
necessary, to not exceed the expected count for that
n-gram in the evidences.
We have replaced a summation over a possibly ex-
ponential number of items (e? ? Dn(f) in Eq. (9))
with a summation over a polynomial number of n-
grams that occur in the evidences2. Both, the ex-
pected length of the evidences r? and their expected
n-gram counts m?k can be pre-computed efficiently
from N -best lists and translation lattices (Kumar et
al., 2009; DeNero et al, 2010).
6 Experiments
We report results on a multi-source translation
task. From the Europarl corpus released for the
ACL 2006 workshop on MT (WMT2006), we se-
lect those sentence pairs from the German?English
(de?en), Spanish?English (es?en) and French?
English (fr?en) sub-corpora that share the same En-
glish translation. We obtain a multi-source corpus
with German, Spanish and French as source lan-
guages and English as target language. All the ex-
periments were carried out with the lowercased and
tokenized version of this corpus.
We report results using BLEU (Papineni et al,
2002) and translation edit rate (Snover et al, 2006)
(TER). We measure statistical significance using

6.1 Base Systems
We combine outputs from three systems, each one
translating from one source language (German,
Spanish or French) into English. Each individual
system is a phrase-based system trained using the
Moses toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007). The parame-
ters of the systems were tuned using MERT (Och,
2003) to optimize BLEU on the development set.
Each base system yields state-of-the-art perfor-
mance, summarized in Table 1. For each system,
we report the performance of max-derivation decod-
ing (MAX) and 1000-best3 MBR decoding (Kumar
and Byrne, 2004).

Table 3: Results on the test set for different setups of
minimum Bayes risk system combination.
MBR and MBR-SC were computed on 1000-best
lists. MBR-SC uses expected BLEU as gain func-
tion using the conjoined evidences spaces of the
three systems to compute expected BLEU statistics.
It performs the search in the free monoid of the out-
put vocabulary, and its model parameters were tuned
using MERT on the development set. This is the
standard setup for MBR system combination, and
we refer to it as MBR-SC-E/C/Ex/MERT in Table 3.
MBR system combination improves single Best
MAX system by +2.0 BLEU points in test, and al-
ways improves over MBR. This improvement could
arise due to multiple reasons: the expected BLEU
gain, the larger evidences space, the extended hy-
potheses space, or the MERT tuned scaling factor
values. Table 3 teases apart these contributions.
We first apply MBR-SC to the best system (MBR-
SC-Expected). Best MBR and MBR-SC-Expected
differ only in the gain function: MBR uses sentence
level BLEU while MBR-SC-Expected uses the ex-
pected BLEU gain described in Section 5. MBR-
SC-Expected performance is comparable to MBR
decoding on the 1000-best list from the single best
system. The expected BLEU approximation per-
forms as well as sentence-level BLEU and addition-
ally requires less total computation.
We now extend the evidences space to the con-
joined 1000-best lists (MBR-SC-E/Conjoin). MBR-
SC-E/Conjoin is much better than the best MBR on
a single system. This implies that either the ex-
pected BLEU statistics computed in the conjoined
evidences space are stronger or the larger conjoined
evidences spaces introduce better hypotheses.
When we restrict the BLEU statistics to be com-
puted from only the best system?s evidences space
(MBR-SC-E/C/evidences-best), BLEU scores dra-
matically decrease relative to MBR-SC-E/Conjoin.
This implies that the expected BLEU statistics com-
puted over the conjoined 1000-best lists are stronger
than the corresponding statistics from the single best
system. On the other hand, if we restrict the search
space to only the 1000-best list of the best sys-
tem (MBR-SC-E/C/hypotheses-best), BLEU scores
also decrease relative to MBR-SC-E/Conjoin. This
implies that the conjoined search space also con-
tains better hypotheses than the single best system?s
search space.
These results validate our approach. The linear
combination of the probability distributions in the
conjoined evidences spaces allows to compute much
stronger statistics for the expected BLEU gain and
also contains some better hypotheses than the single
best system?s search space does.
We next expand the conjoined evidences spaces
using the decoding algorithm described in Sec-
tion 4.2 (MBR-SC-E/C/Extended). In this case, the
expected BLEU statistics are computed from the
conjoined 1000-best lists of the three systems, but
the hypotheses space where we perform the decod-
ing is expanded to the set of all possible finite-
length hypotheses over the vocabulary of the evi-
dences. We take the output of MBR-SC-E/Conjoin
as the initial hypotheses of the decoding (see Algo-
rithm 1). MBR-SC-E/C/Extended improves BLEU
score of MBR-SC-E/Conjoin but obtains a slightly
worse TER score. Since these two systems are iden-
tical in their expected BLEU statistics, the improve-
ments in BLEU imply that the extended search space
has introduced better hypotheses. The degradation
in TER performance can be explained by the use of a
BLEU-based gain function in the decoding process.
We finally compute the optimum values for
the scaling factors of the different system us-
ing MERT (MBR-SC-E/C/Ex/MERT). MBR-SC-
E/C/Ex/MERT slightly improves BLEU score of
MBR-SC-E/C/Extended. This implies that the op-
timal values of the scaling factors do not deviate
much from 1.0; a similar result was reported in (Och
and Ney, 2001). We hypothesize that this is because
the three component systems share the same SMT
model, pre-process and decoding. We expect to ob-
tain larger improvements when combining systems
implementing different MT paradigms.

MBR-SC-E/C/Ex/MERT is the standard setup for
MBR system combination and, from now, on we will
refer to it as MBR-SC.
We next evaluate performance of MBR system
combination on N -best lists of increasing sizes, and
compare it to MBR-SC-E/C/Extended and MBR-
SC-E/Conjoin in the same N -best lists. We list the
results of the Best MAX system for comparison.
Results in Figure 1 confirm the conclusions ex-
tracted from results displayed in Table 3. MBR-SC-
Conjoin is consistently better than the Best MAX
system, and differences in BLEU increase with
the size of the evidences space. This implies that
the linear combination of posterior probabilities al-
low to compute stronger statistics for the expected
BLEU gain, and, in addition, the larger the evi-
dences space is, the stronger the computed statistics
are. MBR-SC-C/Extended is also consistently better
than MBR-SC-Conjoin with an almost constant im-
provement of +0.4 BLEU points. This result show
that the extended search space always contains bet-
ter hypotheses than the conjoined evidences spaces;
also confirms the soundness of Algorithm 1 that al-
lows to reach them. Finally, MBR-SC also slightly
improves MBR-SC-C/Extended. The optimization
of the scaling factors allows only small improve-
ments in BLEU.

6.3 Comparison to System Combination
Figure 3 compares MBR system combination
(MBR-SC) with state-of-the-art system combination
techniques presented to the system combination task
of the ACL 2010 workshop on MT (WMT2010).
All system combination techniques build a ?word
sausage? from the outputs of the different compo-
nent systems and choose a path trough the sausage
with the highest score under different models. A de-
scription of these systems can be found in (Callison-
Burch et al, 2010).
In this task, the output of the component systems
are single hypotheses or unweighted lists thereof.
Therefore, we lack of the statistics of the com-
ponents? posteriors which is one of the main ad-
vantages of MBR system combination over sys-
tem combination techniques. However, we find that,
even in these constrained setting, MBR system com-
bination performance is similar to the best sys-
tem combination techniques for all translation di-
rections. These experiments validate our approach.
MBR system combination yields state-of-the-art
performance while avoiding the challenge of align-
ing translation hypotheses.
7 Conclusion
MBR system combination integrates consensus de-
coding and system combination into a unified multi-
system MBR technique. MBR system combination
uses the MBR decision rule on a linear combina-
tion of the component systems? probability distri-
butions to search for the sentence with the mini-
mum Bayes risk on the complete set of finite-length

strings in the output vocabulary. Component sys-
tems can have varied decoding strategies; we only
require that each system produce an N -best list (or
a lattice) of translations. This flexibility allows the
technique to be applied quite broadly. For instance,
Leusch et al (2010) generate intermediate transla-
tions in several pivot languages, translate them sep-
arately into the target language, and generate a con-
sensus translation out of these using a system combi-
nation technique. Likewise, these pivot translations
could be combined via MBR system combination.
MBR system combination has two significant ad-
vantages over current approaches to system combi-
nation. First, it does not rely on hypothesis align-
ment between outputs of individual systems. Align-
ing translation hypotheses can be challenging and
has a substantial effect on combination perfor-
mance (He et al, 2008). Instead of aligning the sen-
tences, we view the sentences as vectors of n-gram
counts and compute the expected statistics of the
BLEU score to compute the Bayes gain. Second, we
do not need to pick a backbone system for combina-
tion. Choosing a backbone system can also be chal-
lenging and also affects system combination per-
formance (He and Toutanova, 2009). MBR system
combination sidesteps this issue by working directly
on the conjoined evidences space produced by the
outputs of the component systems, and allows the
consensus model to express system preferences via
scaling factors.
Despite its simplicity, MBR system combination
provides strong performance by leveraging different
consensus, decoding and training techniques. It out-
performs best MAX or MBR derivation on each of
the component systems. In addition, it obtains state-
of-the-art performance in a constrained setting better
suited for dominant system combination techniques.
