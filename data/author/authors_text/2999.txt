Abstract 
Zipf?s law states that the frequency of 
word tokens in a large corpus of natural 
language is inversely proportional to the 
rank. The law is investigated for two 
languages English and Mandarin and for n-
gram word phrases as well as for single 
words. The law for single words is shown 
to be valid only for high frequency words. 
However, when single word and n-gram 
phrases are combined together in one list 
and put in order of frequency the combined 
list follows Zipf?s law accurately for all 
words and phrases, down to the lowest 
frequencies in both languages. The Zipf 
curves for the two languages are then 
almost identical.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
The law discovered empirically by Zipf 
(1949) for word tokens in a corpus states that if 
f is the frequency of a word in the corpus and r 
is the rank, then: 
r
kf =  (1) 
where k is a constant for the corpus. When 
log(f) is drawn against log(r) in a graph (which 
is often called a Zipf curve), a straight line is 
obtained with a slope of ?1. An example with a 
small corpus of 250,000 tokens is given in 
Figure 1. Zipf?s discovery was followed by a 
large body of literature reviewed in a series of 
papers edited by Guiter and Arapov (1982). It 
continues to stimulate interest today 
(Samuelson, 1996; Montermurro, 2002; Ferrer 
and Sol?, 2002) and, for example, it has been 
applied to citations Silagadze (1997) and to 
DNA sequences (Yonezawa & Motohasi, 1999; 
Li, 2001).

Zipf discovered the law by analysing 
manually the frequencies of words in the novel 
?Ulysses? by James Joyce. It contains a 
vocabulary of 29,899 different word types 
associated with 260,430 word tokens. 
Following its discovery in 1949, 
several experiments aided by the appearance of 
the computer in the 1960?s, confirmed that the 
law was correct for the small corpora which 
could be processed at that time. The slope of 
the curve was found to vary slightly from ?1 
for some corpora; also the frequencies for the 
highest ranked words sometimes deviated 
slightly from the straight line, which suggested 
several modifications of the law, and in 
particular one due to Mandelbrot (1953): 
?? )( += r
kf  (2) 
where ? and ? are constants for the corpus 
being analysed. However, generally the 
constants ? and ? were found to be only small 
statistical deviations from the original law by 
Zipf (exceptions are legal texts which have 
smaller ? values (?0.9) showing that lawyers 
use more words than other people!)(Smith & 
Devine, 1985). 
A number of theoretical developments 
of Zipf?s law had been derived in the 50?s and 
60?s and have been reviewed by Fedorowicz 
(1982), notably those due to Mandelbrot (1954, 
1957) and Booth (1967). A well-known 
derivation, due to Simon (1955), is based on 
empirically derived distribution functions. 
However, Simon?s derivation was controversial 
and a correspondence in the scientific press 
developed between Mandelbrot and Simon on 
the validity of this derivation (1959-1961); the 
dispute was not resolved by the time Zipf 
curves for larger corpora were beginning to be 
computed. 
The processing of larger corpora with 1 
million words or more was facilitated by the 
development of PC?s in the 1980?s. When Zipf 
curves for these corpora were drawn they were 
found to drop below the Zipf straight line with 
slope of ?1 at the bottom of the curve, starting 
for rank greater than about 5000. This is 
illustrated in Figure 2 which shows the Zipf 
curve for the Brown corpus of 1 million words 
of American English (Francis & Kucera, 1964).

This appeared to confirm the opinion of 
the opponents of Simon?s derivation: the law 
clearly did not hold for r>5000; so it appeared 
that the derivation must be invalid. 
 
2. Zipf Curves for Large Corpora 
 
This paper is principally concerned 
with exploring the above invalidity of Zipf?s 
law for large corpora in two languages, English 
and Mandarin. We begin with English. 
 
English corpora 
 
The English corpora used in our 
experiments are taken from the Wall Street 
journal (Paul & Baker, 1992) for 1987, 1988, 
1989, with sizes approximately 19 million, 16 
million and 6 million tokens respectively. The 
Zipf curves for the 3 corpora are shown in 
Figure 3.

the 3 training corpora of the WSJ 
The curves are parallel, showing 
similar structures and all 3 deviating from 
Zipf?s law for larger r. Their separation is due 
to their different sizes. 
Language is not made of individual 
words but also consists of phrases of 2, 3 and 
more words, usually called n-grams for n=2, 3, 
etc. For each value of n between 2 and 5, we 
computed the frequencies of all n-gram in each 
corpus and put them in rank order as we had 
done for the words. This enabled us to draw the 
Zipf curves for 2-grams to 5-grams which are 
shown along with the single word curves in 
Figures 4, 5 and 6 for the three corpora. These 
curves are similar to the first Zipf curves drawn 
for n-grams by Smith and Devine (1985); but 
these earlier curves were for a much smaller 
corpus.

bigram curves when the rank ? 3000 in all three 
cases. 
The ten most common words, bigrams 
and trigrams in the combined WSJ corpus of 40 
million words are listed in Table 2. 
 
Mandarin corpora 
 
The Mandarin corpus used in our experiments 
is the TREC Corpus. It was obtained from the 
People?s Daily Newspaper from 01/1991 to 
12/1993 and from the Xinhua News Agency for 
04/1994 to 09/1995 from the Linguistic Data 
Consortium (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu). TREC 
has  19,546,872  tokens  similar in size to the 
largest of the English corpora. The Mandarin 
language is a syllable-class language, in which 
each syllable is at the same time a word and a 
Chinese character. Other words, compound 
words, are built up by combining syllables 
together, similar to word n-grams in English. 
The most common unigrams, bigrams and 
trigrams are listed in Table 3.  
The number of syllable-types (i.e. 
unigrams) in the TREC corpus is  only  6,300, 
very different from English (the WSJ87 corpus 
has 114,718 word types); so it is not surprising 
that the Zipf curve for unigrams in Mandarin in 
Figure 7 is very different from the Zipf curve 
for unigrams in English. It is similar to a 
previous curve for a smaller Mandarin corpus 
of 2,022,604 tokens by Clark, Lua and 
McCallum (1986). The Zipf curves for n-grams

Figure 7 Zipf curves for the TREC Mandarin corpus 
Except for the unigrams, the shapes of 
the other TREC n-gram Zipfian curves are 
similar to but not quite the same as those for 
the  English corpora.  In particular  the   bigram 
curve  for  Mandarin  is  more  curved  than  the 
English curve because there are more 
compound words in Mandarin than English.  
The Mandarin ?-values in Table 1 are 
also higher than for English, on average by 
about 0.1, which is due to the different 
distribution of unigrams. For TREC, the 
crossing point between the unigram curve and 
the bigram curve is at rank: 1224, frequency: 
1750, unigram: " ", bigram: " ". The 
unigram curve and the trigram curve cross each 
other at rank: 1920, frequency: 491, unigram: 
" ", trigram: " ". This is very 
different from English. 
Comparisons between the n-grams 
curves (n = 1 to 4) for English and Mandarin 
are made in Figure 8, 9, 10 and 11. The English 
curves are for the 3 WSJ corpora joined 
together making a 40 million word corpus.

3. Combined n-grams 
 
 The derivation of Zipf?s law by Simon 
was based solely on single words and it failed 
for English when the number of word types 
was greater than about 5000 words. In 
Mandarin it failed almost immediately for 
unigrams because of the limited number of 
characters. However it might not have failed if 
the Mandarin compound words in the bigram, 
trigram and higher n-gram statistics had been 
included; this suggested that the n-gram and 
unigram curves should be combined. Perhaps 
the same may be true for English. So we should 
combine the English curves also. 
 This can be justified in another way. In 
a critical part of his derivation Simon gives an 
initial probability to a new word found in the 
corpus as it introduces some new meaning not 
expressed by previous words. However, as the 
number of words increases new ideas are 
frequently expressed not in single words, but in 
multi-word phrases or compound words. This 
was left out of Simon?s derivation. If he had 
included it, the law he derived would have 
included phrases as well as words. So perhaps 
Zipf?s law should include words and phrases. 
We therefore put all unigram and n-
gram together with their frequencies into one 
large file, sorted on frequency and put in rank 
order as previously. The resulting Zipf curve 
for the combined curves for both English and 
Mandarin are shown in Figure 12.

 Figure 12 Combined Zipf curves for the English WSJ 
and the TREC Mandarin corpora 
 
This shows that the n-grams (n > 2) 
exactly make up for the deviation of the two 
very different unigram curves from Zipf?s law 
and the combined curves for both languages are 
straight lines with slopes close to ?1 for all 
ranks>100. This result appears to vindicate 
Simon?s derivation. However, whether Simon?s 
derivation is entirely valid or not, the results in 
Figure 12 are a new confirmation of Zipf?s 
original law in an extended form. This 
remarkable result has been found to be valid for 
3 other natural languages: Irish, Latin and 
Vietnamese, in preliminary experiments.

Abstract 
Statistical language models should       
improve as the size of the n-grams         
increases from 3 to 5 or higher. However, 
the number of parameters and                 
calculations, and the storage requirement 
increase very rapidly if we attempt to 
store all possible combinations of           
n-grams. To avoid these problems, the 
reduced n-grams? approach previously 
developed by O?Boyle (1993) can be     
applied. A reduced n-gram language 
model can store an entire corpus?s 
phrase-history length within feasible 
storage limits. Another theoretical         
advantage of reduced n-grams is that they 
are closer to being semantically complete 
than traditional models, which include all 
n-grams. In our experiments, the reduced 
n-gram Zipf curves are first presented, 
and compared with previously obtained 
conventional n-grams for both English 
and Chinese. The reduced n-gram model 
is then applied to large English and       
Chinese corpora. For English, we can       
reduce the model sizes, compared to       
7-gram traditional model sizes, with       
factors of 14.6 for a 40-million-word 
corpus and 11.0 for a 500-million-word 
corpus while obtaining 5.8% and 4.2% 
improvements in perplexities. For              
Chinese, we gain a 16.9% perplexity       
reductions and we reduce the model size 
by a factor larger than 11.2. This paper is 
a step towards the modeling of English 
and Chinese using semantically complete 
phrases in an n-gram model. 
1 Introduction to the Reduced N-Gram 
Approach 
Shortly after this laboratory first published a 
variable n-gram algorithm (Smith and O?Boyle, 
1992), O?Boyle (1993) proposed a statistical 
method to improve language models based on the 
removal of overlapping phrases. 
A distortion in the use of phrase frequencies 
had been observed in the small railway timetable 
Vodis Corpus when the bigram ?RAIL            
ENQUIRIES? and its super-phrase ?BRITISH 
RAIL ENQUIRIES? were examined. Both occur 
73 times, which is a large number for such a 
small corpus. ?ENQUIRIES? follows ?RAIL? 
with a very high probability when it is preceded 
by ?BRITISH.? However, when ?RAIL? is      
preceded by words other than ?BRITISH,?        
?ENQUIRIES? does not occur, but words like 
?TICKET? or ?JOURNEY? may. Thus, the     
bigram ?RAIL ENQUIRIES? gives a misleading 
probability that ?RAIL? is followed by          
?ENQUIRIES? irrespective of what precedes it. 
At the time of their research, O?Boyle reduced 
the frequencies of ?RAIL ENQUIRIES? by        
subtracting the frequency of the larger trigram, 
which gave a probability of zero for                
?ENQUIRIES? following ?RAIL? if it was not 
preceded by ?BRITISH.? The phrase with a new 
reduced frequency is called a reduced phrase. 
Therefore, a phrase can occur in a corpus as a 
reduced n-gram in some places and as part of a 
larger reduced n-gram in other places. In a         
reduced model, the occurrence of an n-gram is 
not counted when it is a part of a larger reduced 
n-gram. One algorithm to detect/identify/extract 
reduced n-grams from a corpus is the so-called 
reduced n-gram algorithm. In 1992, O?Boyle was 
able to use it to analyse the Brown corpus of 
American English (Francis and Kucera, 1964) (of 
one million word tokens, whose longest phrase-
309
length is 30), which was a considerable               
improvement at the time. The results were used 
in an n-gram language model by O?Boyle, but 
with poor results, due to lack of statistics from 
such a small corpus. We have developed and       
present here a modification of his method, and 
we discuss its usefulness for reducing n-gram 
perplexity. 
2 Similar Approaches and Capability 
Recent progress in variable n-gram language 
modeling has provided an efficient                   
representation of n-gram models and made the 
training of higher order n-grams possible.    
Compared to variable n-grams, class-based     
language models are more often used to reduce 
the size of a language model, but this typically 
leads to recognition performance degradation. 
Classes can alternatively be used to smooth a 
language model or provide back-off estimates, 
which have led to small performance gains. For 
the LOB corpus, the varigram model obtained 
11.3% higher perplexity in comparison with the 
word-trigram model (Niesler and Woodland, 
1996.) 
Kneser (1996) built up variable-context length 
language models based on the North American 
Business News (NAB-240 million words) and 
the German Verbmobil (300,000 words with a 
vocabulary of 5,000 types.) His results show that 
the variable-length model outperforms            
conventional models of the same size, and if a 
moderate loss in performance is acceptable, that 
the size of a language model can be reduced 
drastically by using his pruning algorithm.      
Kneser?s results improve with longer contexts 
and a same number of parameters. For example, 
reducing the size of the standard NAB trigram 
model by a factor of 3 results in a loss of only 
7% in perplexity and 3% in the word error rate. 
The improvement obtained by Kneser?s method 
depended on the length of the fixed context and 
on the amount of available training data. In the 
case of the NAB corpus, the improvement was 
10% in perplexity. 
Siu and Ostendorf (2000) developed Kneser?s 
basic ideas further and applied the variable        
4-gram, thus improving the perplexity and word 
error rate results compared to a fixed trigram 
model. They obtained word error reductions of 
0.1 and 0.5% (absolute) in development and    
evaluation test sets, respectively. However, the 
number of parameters was reduced by 60%. By 
using the variable 4-gram, they were able to 
model a longer history while reducing the size of 
the model by more than 50%, compared to a 
regular trigram model, and at the same time      
improve both the test-set perplexity and           
recognition performance. They also reduced the 
size of the model by an additional 8%. 
Other related work are those of Seymore and 
Rosenfeld (1996); Hu, Turin and Brown (1997); 
Blasig (1999); and Goodman and Gao (2000.)

3 Reduced N-Gram Algorithm 
The main goal of this algorithm (Ha, 2005) is to 
produce three main files from the training text: 
? The file that contains all the complete   
n-grams appearing at least m times is 
called the PHR file (m ? 2.) 
? The file that contains all the n-grams   
appearing as sub-phrases, following the 
removal of the first word from any other 
complete n-gram in the PHR file, is called 
the SUB file. 
? The file that contains any overlapping   
n-grams that occur at least m times in the 
SUB file is called the LOS file. 
The final list of reduced phrases is called the FIN 
file, where 
SUBLOSPHRFIN ?+=:
 
(1) 
Before O?Boyle?s work, a student (Craig) in an 
unpublished project used a loop algorithm that 
was equivalent to FIN:=PHR?SUB. This yields 
negative frequencies for some resulting n-grams 
with overlapping, hence the need for the LOS 
file. 
There are 2 additional files 
? To create the PHR file, a SOR file is 
needed that contains all the complete       
n-grams regardless of m (the SOR file is 
the PHR file in the special case where      
m = 1.) To create the PHR file, words are 
removed from the right-hand side of each 
SOR phrase in the SOR file until the      
resultant phrase appears at least m times (if 
the phrase already occurs more than m 
times, no words will be removed.) 
? To create the LOS file, O?Boyle applied 
a POS file: for any SUB phrase, if one 
word can be added back on the right-hand 
side (previously removed when the PHR 
file was created from the SOR file), then 
one POS phrase will exist as the added 
phrase. Thus, if any POS phrase appears at 
least m times, its original SUB phrase will 
be an overlapping n-gram in the LOS file. 
The application scope of O?Boyle?s reduced       
n-gram algorithm is limited to small corpora, 
such as the Brown corpus (American English) of 
1 million words (1992), in which the longest 
phrase has 30 words. Now their algorithm,        
re-checked by us, still works for medium size 
and large corpora. In order to work well for very 
large corpora, it has been implemented by file 
distribution and sort processes. 
Ha, Seymour, Hanna and Smith (2005) have 
investigated a reduced n-gram model for the 
Chinese TREC corpus of the Linguistic Data 
Consortium (LDC) (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/), 
catalog no. LDC2000T52.  
4 Reduced N-Grams and Zipf?s Law 
By re-applying O?Boyle and Smith?s algorithm, 
we obtained reduced n-grams from two English  
large corpora and a Chinese large corpus. 
The two English corpora used in our            
experiments are the full text of articles appearing 
in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Paul and 
Baker, 1992) for 1987, 1988, 1989, with sizes 
approximately 19 million, 16 million and 6    
million tokens respectively; and the North 
American News Text (NANT) corpus from the 
LDC, sizing 500 million tokens, including Los 
Angeles Times & Washington Post for May 
1994-August 1997, New York Times News    
Syndicate for July 1994-December 1996, Reuters 
News Service (General & Financial) for April 
1994-December 1996 and Wall Street Journal for 
July 1994-December 1996. Therefore, the WSJ 
parts from the two English corpora are not    
overlapping together. 
The Mandarin News corpus from the LDC, 
catalog no. LDC95T13 was obtained from the 
People?s Daily Newspaper from 1991 to 1996 
(125 million syllables); from the Xinhua News 
Agency from 1994 to 1996 (25 million             
syllables); and from transcripts of China Radio 
International broadcast from 1994 to 1996 (100 
million syllables), altogether over 250 million 
syllables. The number of syllable types (i.e.    
unigrams) in the Mandarin News corpus is 6,800. 
Ha, Sicilia-Garcia, Ming and Smith (2003)      
produced a compound word version of the     
Mandarin News corpus with 50,000 types; this 
version was employed in our study for reduced 
n-grams. 
We next present the Zipf curves (Zipf, 1949) 
for the English and Chinese reduced n-grams. 
4.1 Wall Street Journal 
The WSJ reduced n-grams can be created by the 
original O?Boyle-Smith algorithm implemented 
on a Pentium II 586 of 512MByte RAM for over 
40 hours, the disk storage requirement being  
only 5GBytes. 
311
The conventional 10-highest frequency WSJ 
words have been published by Ha et al (2002) 
and the most common WSJ reduced unigrams, 
bigrams and trigrams are shown in Table 2. It 
illustrates that the most common reduced word is 
not THE; even OF is not in the top ten. These 
words are now mainly part of longer n-grams 
with large n. 
The Zipf curves are plotted for reduced      
unigrams and n-grams in Figure 1 showing all 
the curves have slopes within [-0.6, -0.5]. The 
WSJ reduced bigram, trigram, 4-gram and          
5-gram curves become almost parallel and 
straight, with a small observed noise between the 
reduced 4-gram and 5-gram curves when they cut 
each other at the beginning. Note that               
information theory tells us that an ideal              
information channel would be made of symbols 
with the same probability. So having a slope of        
?0.5 is closer than ?1 to this ideal.

The NANT reduced n-grams are created by the 
improved algorithm after over 300 hours           
processing, needing a storage requirement of 
100GBytes on a Pentium II 586 of 512MByte 
RAM. 
Their Zipf curves are plotted for reduced       
unigrams and n-grams in Figure 2 showing all 
the curves are just sloped around [-0.54, -0.5]. 
The reduced unigrams of NANT still show the    
2-slope behavior when it starts with slope ?0.54 
and then drop with slope nearly ?2 at the end of 
the curve. We have found that the traditional       
n-grams also show this behaviour, with an initial 
slope of ?1 changing to ?2 for large ranks (Ha 
and Smith, 2004.)

Figure 3. Mandarin reduced n-gram Zipf curves 
The Mandarin News reduced word n-grams were 
created in 120 hours, using 20GB of disk space.  
The Zipf curves are plotted in Figure 3 showing 
that the unigram curve now has a larger slope 
than ?1, it is around ?1.2. All the n-gram curves 
are now straighter and more parallel than the    
traditional n-gram curves, have slopes within      
[-0.67, -0.5]. 
Usually, Zipf?s rank-frequency law with a 
slope ?1 is confirmed by empirical data, but the 
reduced n-grams for English and Chinese shown 
in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 do not confirm 
it. In fact, various more sophisticated models for 
frequency distributions have been proposed by 
Baayen (2001) and Evert (2004.) 
5 Perplexity for Reduced N-Grams 
The reduced n-gram approach was used to build 
a statistical language model based on the 
weighted average model of O?Boyle, Owens and 
Smith (1994.) We rewrite this model in formulae 
(2) and (3)

This averages the probabilities of a word wi      
following the previous one word, two words, 
three words, etc. (i.e. making the last word of an 
n-gram.) The averaging uses weights that          
increase slowly with their frequency and rapidly 
with the length of n-gram. This weighted average 
model is a variable length model that gives        
results comparable to the Katz back-off method 
(1987), but is quicker to use. 
The probabilities of all of the sentences mw1 in 
a test text are then calculated by the weighted 
average model

Ha et al (2005) already investigated and         
analysed the main difficulties arising from       
perplexity calculations for our reduced model: a 
statistical model problem, an unseen word    
problem and an unknown word problem. Their 
solutions are applied in this paper also. Similar 
problems have been found by other authors, e.g. 
Martin, Liermann and Ney (1997); Kneser and 
Ney (1995.) 
The perplexity calculations for both the            
English and Chinese reduced n-grams includes 
statistics on phrase lengths starting with          
unigrams, bigrams, trigrams?and on up to the 
longest phrase which occur in the reduced model. 
The perplexities of the WSJ reduced model are 
shown in Table 3, North American News Text 
corpus in Table 4 and Mandarin News words in 
Table 5. 
The nature of the reduced model makes the       
reporting of results for limited sizes of n-grams 
to be inappropriate, although these are valid for a 
traditional n-gram model. Therefore we show 
results for several n-gram sizes for the traditional 
model, but only one perplexity for the reduced 
model.

In all three cases the reduced model produces a 
modest improvement over the traditional                
3-gram model, but is not as good as the                 
traditional 4-gram or higher models. However in 
all three cases the result is obtained with a      
significant reduction in model size, from a factor 
of 11 to almost 15 compared to the traditional        
7-gram model size.  
We did expect a greater improvement in          
perplexity than we obtained and we believe that a 
further look at the methods used to solve the          
difficult problems listed by Ha et al (2005) 
(mentioned above) and others mentioned by Ha 
(2005) might lead to an improvement. Missing 
word tests are also needed. 
6 Conclusions 
The conventional n-gram language model is   
limited in terms of its ability to represent        
extended phrase histories because of the            
exponential growth in the number of parameters. 
To overcome this limitation, we have                 
re-investigated the approach of O?Boyle (1993) 
and created reduced n-gram models. Our aim 
was to try to create an n-gram model that used 
semantically more complete n-grams than      
traditional n-grams in the expectation that this 
might lead to an improvement in language      
modeling. The improvement in perplexity is 
modest, but there is a large decrease in model 
size. So this represents an encouraging step     
forward, although still very far from the final 
step in language modelling.
