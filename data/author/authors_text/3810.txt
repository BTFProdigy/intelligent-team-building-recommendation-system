Abstract 
In this paper we use the Reeks Nederlandse 
Dialectatlassen as a source for the recon-
struction of a ?proto-language? of Dutch 
dialects. We used 360 dialects from loca-
tions in the Netherlands, the northern part 
of Belgium and French-Flanders. The den-
sity of dialect locations is about the same 
everywhere. For each dialect we recon-
structed 85 words. For the reconstruction of 
vowels we used knowledge of Dutch his-
tory, and for the reconstruction of conso-
nants we used well-known tendencies 
found in most textbooks about historical 
linguistics. We validated results by com-
paring the reconstructed forms with pro-
nunciations according to a proto-Germanic 
dictionary (K?bler, 2003). For 46% of the 
words we reconstructed the same vowel or 
the closest possible vowel when the vowel 
to be reconstructed was not found in the 
dialect material. For 52% of the words all 
consonants we reconstructed  were the 
same. For 42% of the words, only one con-
sonant was differently reconstructed. We 
measured the divergence of Dutch dialects 
from their ?proto-language?. We measured 
pronunciation distances to the proto-
language we reconstructed ourselves and 
correlated them with pronunciation dis-
tances we measured to proto-Germanic 
based on the dictionary. Pronunciation dis-
tances were measured using Levenshtein 
distance, a string edit distance measure. We 
found a relatively strong correlation 
(r=0.87). 
1 Introduction 
In Dutch dialectology the Reeks Nederlandse Dia-
lectatlassen (RND), compiled by Blancquaert & 
P?e (1925-1982) is an invaluable data source. The 
atlases cover the Dutch language area. The Dutch 
area comprises The Netherlands, the northern part 
of Belgium (Flanders), a smaller northwestern part 
of France, and the German county of Bentheim. 
The RND contains 1956 varieties, which can be 
found in 16 volumes. For each dialect 139 sen-
tences are translated and transcribed in phonetic 
script. Blancquaert mentions that the questionnaire 
used for this atlas was conceived of as a range of 
sentences with words that illustrate particular 
sounds. The design was such that, e.g., various 
changes of older Germanic vowels, diphthongs and 
consonants are represented in the questionnaire 
(Blancquaert 1948, p. 13). We exploit here the his-
torical information in this atlas.  
The goals of this paper are twofold. First we aim 
to reconstruct a ?proto-language? on the basis of 
the RND dialect material and see how close we 
come to the protoforms found in Gerhard K?bler?s 
neuhochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch 
(K?bler, 2003). We recognize that we actually re-
construct a stage that would never have existed in 
prehistory. In practice, however, we are usually 
forced to use incomplete data, since data collec-
tions -- such as the RND ? are restricted by politi-
cal boundaries, and often some varieties are lost.  
In this paper we show the usefulness of a data 
source like the RND. 
Second we want to measure the divergence of 
Dutch dialects compared to their proto-language. 
We measure the divergence of the dialect pronun-
ciations. We do not measure the number of 
changes that happened in the course of time. For 
31
example if a [u] changed into a [y] and then the [y] 
changed into a [u], we simply compare the [u] to 
the proto-language pronunciation. However, we do 
compare Dutch dialects to both the proto-language 
we reconstruct ourselves, which we call Proto-
Language Reconstructed (PLR), and to the Proto-
language according to the proto-Germanic Dic-
tionary, which we call Proto-Germanic according 
to the Dictionary (PGD). 
2 Reconstructing the proto-language 
From the nearly 2000 varieties in the RND we 
selected 360 representative dialects from locations 
in the Dutch language area. The density of 
locations is about the same everywhere. 
In the RND, the same 141 sentences are trans-
lated and transcribed in phonetic script for each 
dialect. Since digitizing the phonetic texts is time-
consuming on the one hand, and since our proce-
dure for measuring pronunciation distances is a 
word-based method on the other hand, we initially 
selected from the text only 125 words.  Each set 
represents a set of potential cognates, inasmuch as 
they were taken from translations of the same sen-
tence in each case. In K?bler?s dictionary we found 
translations of 85 words only; therefore our analy-
ses are based on those 85 words. 
We use the comparative method (CM) as the 
main tool for reconstructing a proto-form on the 
basis of the RND material. In the following sub-
sections we discuss the reconstruction of vowels 
and consonants respectively. 
2.1 Vowels 
For the reconstruction of vowels we used knowl-
edge about sound developments in the history of 
Dutch. In Old Dutch the diphthongs // and // 
turned into monophthongs // and // respectively 
(Quak & van der Horst 2002, p. 32). Van Bree 
(1996) mentions the tendencies that lead // and 
// to change into // and // respectively. From 
these data we find the following chains: 
 
 ?  ?  ?  
 ? 	 ?  ?  
 
An example is twee ?two? which has the vowel 
[] in 11% of the dialects, the [] in 14% of the 
dialects, the [] in 43% of the dialects and the [] in 
20% of the dialects. 1  According to the neu-
hochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch the [] or 
[] is the original sound. Our data show that sim-
ply reconstructing the most frequent sound, which 
is the [], would not give the original sound, but 
using the chain the original sound is easily found. 
To get evidence that the // has raised to // 
(and probably later to //) in a particular word, we 
need evidence that the // was part of the chain. 
Below we discuss another chain where the // has 
lowered to //, and where the // is missing in the 
chain. To be sure that the // was part of the chain, 
we consider the frequency of the //, i.e. the num-
ber of dialects with // in that particular word. The 
frequency of // should be higher than the fre-
quency of // and/or higher than the frequency of 
//. Similarly for the change from // to // we 
consider the frequency of //. 
Another development mentioned by Van Bree is 
that high monophthongs diphthongize. In the tran-
sition from middle Dutch to modern Dutch, the 
monophthong // changed into //, and the mo-
nophthong /
/ changed into either /
/ or /	/ 
(Van der Wal, 1994). According to Van Bree 
(1996, p. 99), diphthongs have the tendency to 
lower. This can be observed in Polder Dutch where 
// and /
/ are lowered to // and // (Stroop 
1998). We recognize the following chains: 
 
 ?  ?  

 ? 
/	 ?  
 ? 	 ?  
 
Different from the chains mentioned above, we 
do not find the // and // respectively in these 
chains. To get evidence for these chains, the fre-
quency of // should be lower than both the fre-
quency of // and //, and the frequency of // 
should be lower than both /	/ and //.  
Sweet (1888, p. 20) observes that vowels have 
the tendency to move from back to front. Back

 The sounds mentioned may be either monophthongs or 
diphthongs. 
32
vowels favour rounding, and front vowels un-
rounding. From this, we derive five chains: 
 
 ? 
 ?  
 ?  ?  
 ?  ?  
 ?  ? 	 
 ? ? ?  
 
However, unrounded front vowels might be-
come rounded under influence from a labial or 
labiodental consonant. For example vijf ?five? is 
sometimes pronounced as [] and sometimes as 
[
]. The [] has been changed into [
] under in-
fluence of the labiodental [] and []. 
Sweet (1888, p. 22) writes that the dropping of 
unstressed vowels is generally preceded by various 
weakenings in the direction of a vowel close to 
schwa. In our data we found that the word mijn 
?my? is sometimes [] and sometimes []. A non-
central unstressed vowel might change into a cen-
tral vowel which in turn might be dropped. In gen-
eral we assume that deletion of vowels is more 
likely than insertion of vowels. 
Most words in our data have one syllable. For 
each word we made an inventory of the vowels 
used across the 360 varieties. We might recognize 
a chain in the data on the basis of vowels which 
appear at least two times in the data. For 37 words 
we could apply the tendencies mentioned above. In 
the other cases, we reconstruct the vowel by using 
the vowel found most frequently among the 360 
varieties, working with Occam?s Razor as a guid-
ing principle. When both monophthongs and diph-
thongs are found among the data, we choose the 
most frequent monophthong. Sweet (1888, p. 21) 
writes that isolative diphthongizaton ?mainly af-
fects long vowels, evidently because of the diffi-
culty of prolonging the same position without 
change.? 
2.2 Consonants 
For the reconstruction of consonants we used ten 
tendencies which we discuss one by one below. 
Initial and medial voiceless obstruents become 
voiced when (preceded and) followed by a voiced 
sound. Hock & Joseph (1996) write that weakening 
(or lenition) ?occurs most commonly in a medial 
voiced environment (just like Verner?s law), but 
may be found in other contexts as well.? In our 
data set zes ?six? is pronounced with a initial [] in 
most cases and with an initial [] in the dialects of 
Stiens and Dokkum. We reconstructed [].2 
Final voiced obstruents of an utterance become 
voiceless. Sweet (1888, p. 18) writes that the natu-
ral isolative tendency is to change voice into un-
voiced. He also writes that the ?tendency to un-
voicing is shown most strongly in the stops.? Hock 
& Joseph (1996, p. 129) write that final devoicing 
?is not confined to utterance-final position but ap-
plies word-finally as well.? 3  In our data set we 
found that for example the word-final consonant  
in op ?on? is sometimes a [p] and sometimes a [b]. 
Based on this tendency, we reconstruct the [b]. 
Plosives become fricatives between vowels, be-
fore vowels or sonorants (when initial), or after 
vowels (when final). Sweet writes that the ?opening 
of stops generally seems to begin between vow-
els?? (p. 23). Somewhat further he writes that in 
Dutch the g has everywhere become a fricative 
while in German the initial g remained a stop. For 
example goed ?good? is pronounced as [] in 
Frisian dialects, while other dialects have initial [] 
or []. Following the tendency, we consider the [] 
to be the older sound. Related to this is the pronun-
ciation of words like schip ?ship? and school 
?school?. As initial consonants we found [sk], [sx] 
and [
