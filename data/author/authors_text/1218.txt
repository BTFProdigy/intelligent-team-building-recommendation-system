Abstract 
We present a novel automatic approach to 
constructing a bilingual semantic network?the 
BiFrameNet, to enhance statistical and 
transfer-based machine translation systems. 
BiFrameNet is a frame semantic representation, 
and contains semantic structure transfers 
between English and Chinese. The English 
FrameNet and the Chinese HowNet provide us 
with two different views of the semantic 
distribution of lexicon by linguists. We propose 
to induce the mapping between the English 
lexical entries in FrameNet to Chinese word 
senses in HowNet, furnishing a bilingual 
semantic lexicon which simulates the ?concept 
lexicon? supposedly used by human translators, 
and which can thus be beneficial to machine 
translation systems.  BiFrameNet alo contains 
bilingual example sentences that have the same 
semantic roles. We automatically induce 
Chinese example sentences and their semantic 
roles, based on semantic structure alignment 
from the first stage of our work, as well as 
shallow syntactic structure. In addition to its 
utility for machine-aided and machine 
translations, our work is also related to the 
spatial models proposed by cognitive scientists 
in the framework of artifactual simulations of 
the translation process. 
1. Introduction 
The merits of translation at the word level or 
the concept level have long been a cause for debate 
among linguists. Some linguists suggest that the two 
languages of a bilingual speaker share a common 
semantic system (Illes and Francis 1999; Ikeda 1998) 
and hence translation is carried out at the concept 
level.  
Meanwhile, there has been a gradual 
convergence of statistical and transfer approaches in 
machine translation recently (Wu 2003). Statistical 
MT systems are based on a stochastic mapping 
between lexical items, assuming the underlying 
semantic transfer is hidden. Transfer systems use 
explicit lexical, syntactic and semantic transfer rules. 
Consequently, cognitive scientists and 
computational linguists alike have been interested in 
the study of semantic mapping between languages 
(Ploux and Ji, 2003, Dorr et al, 2002, Ngai et al, 
2002, Boas 2002, Palmer and Wu, 1995). We 
propose to automatically construct a bilingual lexical 
semantic network with word sense and semantic role 
mapping between English and Chinese, simulating 
the ?concept lexicon?, suggested by cognitive 
scientists, of a bilingual person.  
 
 
  
Figure 1. BiFrameNet lexicon and example 
sentence induction 
 
The linguists-defined ontologies?-FrameNet 
(Baker et al, 1998), HowNet (Dong and Dong, 
2000), and bilingual dictionaries are the basis for the 
induction of the mapping. We automatically estimate 
the semantic transfer likelihoods between English 
FrameNet lexical entries and the Chinese word 
senses in HowNet, and align those frames and 
lexical pairs with high likelihood values. In addition, 
we propose to induce Chinese example sentences 
automatically to match English annotated sentences 
provided in the FrameNet. The BiFrameNet thus 
induced provides an additional resource for 
machine-aided or machine translation systems. It can 
also serve as a reference to be compared to cognitive 
studies of the translation process.

 Figure 2. BiFrameNet ontology induction  
 
Ploux and Ji, (2003) proposed a spatial model for 
matching semantic values between French and 
English. Palmer and Wu (1995) studied the mapping 
of change-of-state English verbs to Chinese. Dorr et 
al. (2002) described a technique for the construction 
of a Chinese-English verb lexicon based on HowNet 
and the English LCS Verb Database (LVD). They 
created links between HowNet concepts and LVD 
verb classes using both statistics and a manually 
constructed ?seed mapping? of thematic classes 
between HowNet and LVD. Ngai et al (2002) 
employed a word-vector based approach to create the 
alignment between WordNet and HowNet classes 
without any manual annotation. Boas (2002) outlined 
a number of issues surrounding the planning and 
design of GermanFrameNet (GFN), a bilingual 
FrameNet dictionary which, when complete, will 
have a corpus-based German lexicon following the 
FrameNet structure. 
2.1. FrameNet and HowNet 
The Berkeley FrameNet database consists of 
frame-semantic descriptions of more than 7000 
English lexical items, together with example 
sentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker et al, 
1998). There is currently no frame semantic 
representation of Chinese. However, the Chinese 
HowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) represents a 
hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chinese.   
 This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
describes the algorithm for estimating transfer 
relations between FrameNet and HowNet structures.  
Section 3 presents our method for selecting 
BiFrameNet example sentences for a particular 
frame and automatically inducing semantic role 
annotations. We conclude in Section 4, followed by 
a discussion in Section 5.  
FrameNet is a collection of lexical entries grouped 
by frame semantics. Each lexical entry represents an 
individual word sense, and is associated with 
semantic roles and some annotated sentences. 
Lexical entries with the same semantic roles are 
grouped into a ?frame? and the semantic roles are 
called ?frame elements?. For example: 
 
Frame: Cause_harm 
Frame Elements: agent, body_part, cause, event, 
instrument, iterations, purpose, reason, result, 
victim?.. 
Lexical Entries: 
bash.v, batter.v, bayonet.v, beat.v, belt.v, 
bludgeon.v, boil.v, break.v, bruise.v, buffet.v, 
burn.v,?. 
Example annotated sentence of lexical entry 
?beat.v?: 
[agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him] 
[means with my fists].  
2. Lexical semantic mapping in BiFrameNet  
Dorr et al (2002) uses a manual seed mapping of 
semantic roles between FrameNet and LVD to 
induce a bilingual verb lexicon. In this paper, we 
propose a method of automatically mapping the 
English FrameNet lexical entries to HowNet 
concepts, resulting in the BiFrameNet ontology. We 
also make use of two bilingual English-Chinese 
lexicons for this induction. In this section 2, we use 
an example FrameNet lexical entry ?beat.v? in the 
?cause_harm? frame to illustrate the main steps of 
our algorithm.  
HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph 
structure of word senses called ?concepts?, and each 
concept contains 7 fields including lexical entries in 
Chinese, English gloss, POS tags for the word in 
Chinese and English, and a definition of the concept 
including its category and semantic relations (Dong 
and Dong, 2000). For example, one translation for 
?beat.v? is ?: 
In this work, we make use of contextual lexical 
entries from the same semantic frame, as illustrated 
above. In this example, the ?cause_harm? frame 
contains two lexical entries??beat.v? and ?strike.v?. 
From the previous step, ?beat.v? and ?strike.v? is 
each linked to a number of Chinese candidates. 
?beat.v? is linked to ??? with membership in two 
different HowNet categories, namely ??|beat? and 
? ?? |associate?. To disambiguate between the 
above these 2 candidate categories, we make use of 
the other lexical entries in ?cause_harm?, in this case 
?strike.v? which is linked to ???,  in the ??|beat? 
HowNet category. Now, ?|beat? receives two votes 
(from ?? and from ??), and ?|associate? only 
one (from ??). We therefore choose the HowNet 
category ?|beat? to be aligned to the frame 
?cause_harm?, and eliminate the sense of ???in the 
? ? ? |associate? category.  Consequently, 
?beat.v? in ?cause_harm? is linked to all HowNet 
concepts that are translations of ?beat? which are 
verbs, and which also belong to the HowNet category 
?|beat? (but not ?|associate?).  
 
NO. = 17645 
W_C =? 
G_C =V 
E_C =~??~??~??~???~??~??~?? 
W_E=attack 
G_E=V 
E_E= 
DEF=fight|?? 
 
Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to 
FrameNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do not 
correspond directly to FrameNet semantic roles. 
 
2.2. Initial mapping based on bilingual lexicon 
(step 1) 
We use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet and 
LDC dictionary to first create all possible mappings 
between FrameNet lexical entries and HowNet 
concepts whose part-of-speech (POS) tags are the 
same. Here we assume that syntactic classification 
for the majority of FrameNet lexical entries (i.e. 
verbs and adjectives) are semantically motivated and 
are mostly preserved across different languages. For 
example ?beat? can be translated into {?, ?, ??, 
??, ??, ??, ?, ???} in HowNet and {?, 
??, ?, ??, ??} in the LDC English-Chinese 
dictionary.   ?beat.v? is then linked to all HowNet 
concepts whose Chinese word/phrase is one of the 
translations and the part of speech is verb ?v?. 
 
In our example, HowNet concepts under two 
HowNet categories??beat? and ?damage? are linked 
to the ?cause_harm? frame in FrameNet. Only the 
concepts in the top N categories are considered as 
correctly linked to the lexical entries in the 
?cause_harm? frame. We heuristically chose N to be 
three in our algorithm. 
2.4. Final mapping adjusted by taxonomy 
distance (step 3) 
Using frame context alone in the above step can 
effectively prune out incorrect links, but it also 
prunes some correct links whose HowNet categories 
are not in the top three categories. In this next step, 
we aim to recover this kind of pruned links by finding 
other categories with high similarity to the chosen 
categories. We introduce the category similarity 
score (Liu and Li, 2002), which is based on the 
HowNet taxonomy distance:  
2.3. Refined mapping based on semantic 
contexts in both languages (step 2) 
At this stage, each FrameNet lexical entry has links 
to multiple HowNet concepts and categories. For 
example, ?beat.v? in ?cause_harm? frame is linked to 
??? in both the ?beat? category and the ?associate? 
category (as in????/make a phone call?). We need 
to choose the correct HowNet concept (word sense). 
Many word sense disambiguation algorithms use 
contextual words in a sentence as disambiguating 
features.  
Sim(category1,category2) = 
+d
?
?  
Where d is the path length from category1 to 
category2 in the taxonomy. ? is an adjusting 
parameter, which controls the curvature of the 
similarity score. We set ?=1.6 in our work following 
the experiment results in Liu and Li (2002). If the 
similarity of category p and one of the top three 
categories is higher than a threshold t, the category p 
is also considered as a valid category for the frame. 
 
 
 
In our example, some valid categories, such as 
?firing|??? is not selected in the previous step even 
though it is related to the ?cause_harm? frame. Based 
on the HowNet taxonomy, the similarity score 
between ?firing|? and ?beat|? is 1.0, which is 
above the threshold set.  Hence, ?firing|? is also 
chosen as a valid category and the concepts in this 
category are linked to the ?beat.v? lexical entry in the 
?cause_harm? frame. However, using taxonomy 
distance can cause errors such as ? in the ?weave? 
category to be aligned to ?beat.v? in the 
?cause_harm? frame. 
2.5. BiFrameNet lexicon evaluation   
We evaluate our work by comparing the results to 
a manually set golden standard of transfer links for 
some lexical entries in FrameNet, and use the 
precision and recall rate as evaluation criteria. 
Manual evaluation of all lexical entries is a slow 
process and is currently still on-going.  However, 
to show the lower bound of the system performance, 
we chose FrameNet lexical entries with the highest 
number of transfer links to HowNet concepts as the 
test set. Since each link is a word sense, these lexical 
entries have most ambiguous translations.  Since 
the number of lexical entries in a FrameNet parent 
frame (i.e. frame size) is an important factor in the 
disambiguation step, we analyze our results by 
distinguishing between ?small frames? (a frame with 
less than 5 lexical entries) and ?large frames?.  
24% of the frames are ?small frames?. Referring to 
Tables 2 and 3, we can see a weighted average of 
(0.649*0.24+0.874*0.76) =82% F-measure.

3. Cross-lingual induction of example 
annotated sentences in BiFrameNet 
In the second stage of our proposed work, we aim 
to automatically induce Chinese example sentences 
that are appropriate for each semantic frame. 
Together with English example sentences that 
already exist in the English FrameNet, they form 
part of the BiFrameNet, and serve to provide 
concrete examples of bilingual usage of semantic 
roles. They can be used either as a resource for 
machine-aided translation or training data for 
machine translation.  
 
FrameNet is a collection of over 100-million 
words of samples of written and spoken language 
from a wide range of sources, including British and 
American English. All the example sentences are 
chosen by linguists for their representative-ness of 
particular semantic roles, grammatical functions, and 
phrase type.  The current FrameNet contains on 
average 30 annotated example sentences per 
predicate, which is still inadequate for automatic 
semantic parsing systems (Fleischman et al, 2003). 
Each FrameNet example sentence contains a 
predicate. The semantic roles of the related frame 
elements are manually labeled. The syntactic phrase 
type (e.g. NP, PP) and their grammatical function 
(e.g. external argument, object argument) are also 
labeled. An example annotated sentence containing 
the predicate ?beat.v?, in the ?cause_harm? frame,  
is  shown below: 
 
Example sentence type: trans-simple  
We are fighting a barbarian, and [agent: we] must 
[predicate: beat] [victim: him].  
 
In order to provide a representative set of Chinese 
example sentences automatically for a particular 
frame, our method must fulfill the following criteria: 
1) It must find real sentences occurring naturally in 
Chinese texts; 
2) It should find sentences that cover as many 
different usage and domain as possible; 
3) It must find sentences that have the same 
semantic roles as the English example sentences;

4) It should require no manual annotation of any 
kind. 
 
There are at least three different (semi-)automatic 
approaches for mining Chinese example sentences: 
 
i) Translate all English example sentences into 
Chinese by automatic means, and annotate the 
semantic roles by word alignment; 
 
This approach is not appropriate because machine 
translation can be erroneous and this method does 
not satisfy criteria (1) and (2). 
 
ii) Construct an English semantic parser and a 
Chinese parser independently, and use them to 
annotate the sentences in a sentence aligned, 
parallel corpus; 
 
Apart from the high cost of building two semantic 
parsers, which itself requires semantically annotated 
Chinese data; it would be necessary to create 
artificial links between independent human 
annotations manually.  
 
iii) Mine Chinese sentences from a monolingual 
corpus that are syntactically similar to the English 
example sentence, and induce semantic roles from 
the syntactic transfer function between English and 
Chinese. 
 
This is the approach we take. Inspired by previous 
work on syntax-driven semantic parsing (Gildea and 
Jurafsky, 2002; Fleischman et al, 2003), and 
syntax-based machine translation (Wu, 1997; 
Cuerzan and Yarowsky, 2002), we postulate that 
syntactically similar sentences with the same 
predicate also share similar semantic roles. In this 
paper, we present our first experiments on inducing 
semantic roles based on shallow syntactic 
information. We mine Chinese example sentences 
from naturally occurring monolingual corpus, and 
rank them by their syntactic similarity to our English 
example sentences. A dynamic programming 
algorithm then annotates the aligned syntactic units 
with the same semantic roles. The example Chinese 
sentences are not translations of the English 
sentences. Therefore, the set of example sentences 
within a frame is enriched, providing better coverage 
for MT and CLIR systems. 
3.1. Induction from aligned predicate bilingual 
lexical pair 
Since frames are disjoint, we propose a method 
for finding example sentences one frame at a time.  
In this paper, we focus on finding Chinese example 
sentences for the largest frame ?cause_harm? and 
the main semantic roles in this frame??agent?, 
?predicate? and ?victim?1.  
 
For each English lexical entry and its target 
translation candidates in the BiFrameNet, we first 
extract sentences that contain the translation 
candidates from a large Chinese monolingual 
corpus. Figure 4 shows some initial Chinese 
example sentence candidates under ?beat.v?. There 
are many sentences that do not have the 
?agent-predicate-victim? structure. Our next step is 
to find the Chinese sentences that have the 
?agent?, ?predicate? and ?victim? semantic roles and 
annotate them automatically.  
 
????????????????? (the southern 
army killed and maimed hundreds of government soldiers) 
??????????????  (soldiers harmed 
innocent civilians during the attack) 
??????????????  (farmers cut down 
more than 70 trees) 
??????? (use the needle to prick the squash) 
*??????????(the media exposed/produced 
an investigation report) 
*???????????????? (some 
publishers adopt a ?idiom? method) 
Figure 4. Some Chinese example sentence and 
glosses 
3.2. Inducing semantic roles from cross-lingual 
POS transfer  
Among all the Chinese sentences containing the 
target predicate words, we need to identify those that 
contain the same semantic roles as those of the 
English example sentences in FrameNet. Current 
automatic semantic parsing algorithms (Gildea and 
Jurafsky 2003, Fleischman et al, 2003) are all based 
on syntactic parse trees showing a close coupling of 
semantic and syntactic structures.  
Without carrying out full syntactic parsing of the 
Chinese sentences, we postulate that the semantic 
                                                        
1 As an example, for ?beat.v?, 73% of the English example 
sentences have these three semantic roles, only 27% also have 
other semantic roles such as ?tools?. 
roles of a sentence are generated by the underlying 
shallow syntactic structure of the sentence such as 
POS tag sequences. We therefore focus on finding 
bilingual sentence pairs that are comparable in POS 
structure, though not necessarily having any lexical 
comparability. Note that this constitutes only a 
subset of all possible Chinese example sentences for 
each frame. The expansion of this set remains the 
objective of our future research

Table 5. Example POS tag transfer  
Given an English example sentence, its semantic 
role sequence, and its POS tag sequence; and a set of 
Chinese sentences and their POS tag sequence, we 
use a dynamic programming method (Figure 5) to 
find the Chinese sentence whose POS sequence is 
most likely to be generated from the English POS 
sequence, and the alignment path. The Chinese word 
aligned to the English word will assume the latter?s 
semantic role.

We estimate the syntactic POS transfer

state-of-the-art POS taggers?a maximum entropy 
based English POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and 
an HMM based Chinese POS tagger.2 We perform 
two sets of experiments: (1) For each example 
English sentence in the ?cause_harm? frame from 
FrameNet, we extract a corresponding Chinese 
sentence annotated with the same semantic roles; (2) 
rank all the Chinese sentences that have been 
aligned to the English sentences by alignment score. 
The highest ranking Chinese sentences are used for 
the BiFrameNet. Table 6 shows that the average 
annotation accuracy of all top Chinese sentence 
candidates for each English example sentence is 
68%. Table 7 shows that the annotation accuracy of

4. Conclusion  
We have presented a first quantitative and 
automatic approach of constructing a bilingual 
lexical semantic resource?the BiFrameNet. 
BiFrameNet consists of mappings between 
FrameNet semantic frames and HowNet concepts, as 
well as English and Chinese example sentences for a 
particular frame, with annotated semantic roles in 
the English FrameNet labels. Evaluation results 
show that we achieve a promising 82% average 
F-measure on lexical entry alignment, for the most 
ambiguous lexical entries; and a 68-72% accuracy in 
Chinese example sentence induction, for the largest 
frame. The initial results are available at 
http://www.cs.ust.hk/~hltc/BiFrameNet and will be 
updated as further improvements and evaluations are 
implemented.  
5. Discussion  
There are a number of possible directions for 
future work. One obvious extension is to use 
syntactic parse tree representations instead of POS 
sequences in example sentence alignment. Second, 
there are many other Chinese sentences that share 
the same semantic roles, but not the same POS 
sequences, which are not included. Using additional 
features to correctly identify these sentences and the 
constituent semantic roles is a topic of our ongoing 
research. Moreover, we note that Chinese is a highly 
idiomatic and metaphoric language. Compounded by 
the ambiguity of word boundaries, many predicate 
usages in Chinese are highly unexpected. It is worth 
considering using other Chinese linguistic resources 
to enhance the example sentence extraction and 
annotation. Finally, BiFrameNet needs to be further 
evaluated and manual post-processing is perhaps 
required.  
We expect the final complete BiFrameNet, in 
addition to the various FrameNet and PropBank 
resources being developed manually, will be a 
valuable resource for statistical and interlingua 
transfer-based MT systems, as well as to human 
translators in an machine-aided translation scenario. 
We are also motivated to investigate the relationship 
between our results and those of semantic mapping 
models proposed by cognitive scientists.

Abstract 
We propose a method of automatically con-
structing an English-Chinese bilingual Fra-
meNet where the English FrameNet lexical 
entries are linked to the appropriate Chinese 
word senses. This resource can be used in ma-
chine translation and cross-lingual IR systems. 
We coerce the English FrameNet into Chinese 
using a bilingual lexicon, frame context in 
FrameNet and taxonomy structure in HowNet. 
Our approach does not require any manual 
mapping between FrameNet and HowNet 
semantic roles. Evaluation results show that 
we achieve a promising 82% average F-
measure for the most ambiguous lexical 
entries.  
1 Introduction 
Since the early 90?s, automatic alignment of bilingual 
documents and sentences based on lexical and syntactic 
information has been a major focus of the statistical 
NLP community as their results are a valuable resource 
for statistical machine translation, cross-lingual question 
answering, and other bilingual or cross-lingual tasks. 
Recently, there has been an increasing trend of using 
semantic information for these tasks spurred by the 
availability of various ontology databases such as 
WordNet, FrameNet, PropBank, etc. Among these, the 
Berkeley FrameNet database is a semantic lexical re-
source consisting of frame-semantic descriptions of 
more than 7000 English lexical items, together with 
example sentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker 
et al, 1998). The current version of FrameNet has been 
applied successfully to English question answering sys-
tems (Gildea, 2002). However, the manual development 
of FrameNet in other languages has been on a small 
scale (e.g. German, Spanish, Japanese) or unfinished 
(e.g. Chinese). Since manually annotation is rather time 
consuming, the main objective of our work is to auto-
matically create multilingual FrameNet to enable se-
mantic analysis in multiple languages rather than in 
English. Another objective is to quantify the mapping 
between semantic structures across language pairs for 
statistical NLP systems. Our basic idea is to coerce the 
English FrameNet into another language using existing 
semantic resources and a bilingual lexicon. Our initial 
target language is Chinese. However, we expect that our 
technique is applicable to other languages as well. There 
are two Chinese semantic resources available today--
Cilin (tong2yi4ci2ci2lin2) (Mei et al, 1982) and 
HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000). Much like WordNet, 
Cilin is a thesaurus with a hierarchical structure of word 
clusters, but it does not describe any semantic relation-
ship between words and categories. HowNet, on the 
other hand, is an ontology with a graph structure of in-
ter-concept relations and inter-attribute relations. In 
addition, HowNet has been widely used in resolving 
NLP problems, such as word sense disambiguation 
(Dang et al, 2002) and machine translation (Dorr et al, 
2002). For our work, we choose to align HowNet con-
cepts to lexical entries in FrameNet in order to construct 
the English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet.   
 
(Dorr et al, 2002) describes a technique for the con-
struction of a Chinese-English verb lexicon based on 
HowNet and an English verb database called the LCS 
Verb Database (LVD). They created links between Chi-
nese concepts in HowNet and English verb classes in 
LVD using both statistics and a manually constructed 
?seed mapping? of thematic classes between HowNet 
and LVD. Ngai et al (2002) employed a word-vector 
based approach to create the alignment between Word-
Net and HowNet classes without any manual annotation. 
In this paper, we present a fully automatic approach to 
create links between FrameNet semantic frames and 
HowNet concepts. We also plan to release an on-line 
demonstration for the community to access the bilingual 
FrameNet we built. 
2 FrameNet and HowNet 
FrameNet and HowNet are ontologies with different 
structures and different semantic role/relation defini-
tions. FrameNet is a collection of lexical entries 
grouped by frame semantics. Each lexical entry repre-
sents an individual word sense, and is associated with 
semantic roles and some annotated sentences. Lexical 
entries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a 
?frame? and the semantic roles are called ?frame ele-
ments?. For example: 
 
Frame: Cause_harm 
Frame Elements: agent, body_part, cause, event, in-
strument, iterations, purpose, reason, result, victim?.. 
Lexical Entries in ?cause_harm? Frame: 
bash.v, batter.v, bayonet.v, beat.v, belt.v, bludgeon.v, 
boil.v, break.v, bruise.v, buffet.v, burn.v,?. 
An annotated sentence of lexical entry ?beat.v?:  
[agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him] 
[means with my fists].  
 
HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of 
word senses called ?concepts?, and each concept con-
tains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-
lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English, 
and a definition of the concept including its category 
and semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000). For 
example, one translation for ?beat.v? is ?: 
NO. = 17645 
W_C =? 
G_C =V 
E_C =~??~??~??~???~??~??~?? 
W_E=attack 
G_E=V 
E_E= 
DEF=fight|?? 
 
Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to Fra-
meNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do not cor-
respond directly to FrameNet semantic roles. 
3 Construction of the English-Chinese Bi-
lingual FrameNet  
(Dorr et al 2002) uses a manual seed mapping of se-
mantic roles between FrameNet and LVD. In this paper, 
we propose a method of automatically linking the Eng-
lish FrameNet lexical entries to HowNet concepts, re-
sulting in a bilingual FrameNet. We make use of two 
bilingual English-Chinese lexicons, as well as HowNet 
and FrameNet. In the following sections 3.1 to 3.3, we 
use an example FrameNet lexical entry ?beat.v? in the 
?cause_harm? frame to illustrate the main steps of our 
algorithm in Figure 1. 
For each lexical entry l in FrameNet 
    Find translations T1 of l in HowNet translations. 
    Find translations T2 of l in LDC dictionary. 
    Combine the T1 and T2 together as T. T= T1?T2 
Link l to all HowNet concepts LC whose W_C field   
is in T. LC= {c|c.W_C ? T}, c is any HowNet  
concept. 
For each frame F in FrameNet  
Group all the HowNet concepts together FC which  
are linked to the lexical entries in F. FC= {c|  
link(c,l)=true and l ? F}. 
    Compute the frequency of HowNet categories in FC. 
Select the top 3 HowNet categories as valid  
categories VA for frame F. 
For each HowNet categories a  
  If the similarity score between a and one of the top  
  3 categories is greater than threshold t. Sim(a, ta) > 
  t, ta is any of the top 3 categories. 
          Add a into VA. VA = VA?{a}. 
    For each lexical entry l in frame F 
         For each HowNet concept c linked to l 
              If the categories of c is not in VA 
prune this link. 
Figure 1. The algorithm.  
 3.1 Baseline mapping based on bilingual lexicon  
We use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet and LDC 
dictionary to first create all possible mappings between 
FrameNet lexical entries and HowNet concepts whose 
part-of-speech (POS) tags are the same. Here we as-
sume that syntactic classification for the majority of 
FrameNet lexical entries (i.e. verbs and adjectives) are 
semantically motivated and are mostly preserved across 
different languages. For example ?beat? can be trans-
lated into {?, ?, ??, ??, ??, ??, ?, ?
??} in HowNet and {?, ??, ?, ??, ??} in 
the LDC English-Chinese dictionary.   ?beat.v? is then 
linked to all HowNet concepts whose Chinese 
word/phrase is one of the translations and the part of 
speech is verb ?v?.  Figure 2 shows some examples of 
HowNet concepts that are linked to ?beat.v?. 
 
Figure 2. Partial initial alignment of ?beat.v? to 
HowNet concepts with 144 candidate links 
 
3.2 Disambiguation by semantic contexts in both 
languages  
At this stage, each FrameNet lexical entry has links to 
multiple HowNet concepts and categories. For example, 
?beat.v? in ?cause_harm? frame is linked to ??? in 
both the ?beat? category and the ?associate? category 
(as in????/make a phone call?). We need to choose 
the correct HowNet concept (word sense). Many word 
sense disambiguation algorithms use contextual words 
in a sentence as disambiguating features. In this work, 
we make use of contextual lexical entries from the same 
semantic frame, as illustrated below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To disambiguate between the above two candidate cate-
gories, we make use of the other lexical entries in 
?cause_harm?, such as ???, and their linked categories 
in HowNet, such as ?beat? again. Each target HowNet 
category receives a vote from the candidate links. In our 
example, ?beat? receives two votes (from ??? and from 
???), and ?associate? only one (from ???). We choose 
the HowNet category with the most votes and its con-
stituent concepts to be the valid word sense links to the 
source FrameNet lexical entry. Consequently, ?beat.v? 
in ?cause_harm? is linked to all HowNet concepts that 
are translations of ?beat? which are verbs, and which 
also belong to the HowNet category ?beat? (vs. ?associ-
ate?).  
Figure 3. Disambiguating HowNet candidates for 
?beat.v? with 42 candidate links 
 
 
In our example, Figure 3 shows the top 14 examples of 
HowNet concepts belonging to two HowNet catego-
ries??beat? and ?damage? that are linked to the 
?cause_harm? frame in FrameNet. Only the concepts in 
the top N categories are considered as correctly linked 
to the lexical entries in the ?cause_harm? frame. We 
heuristically chose N to be three in our algorithm. 
3.3 Compensating links by HowNet taxonomy struc-
ture 
Using frame context alone in the above step can effec-
tively prune out incorrect links, but it also prunes some 
correct links whose HowNet categories are not in the 
top three categories but are similar to them. In this next 
step, we aim to recover this kind of pruned links. We 
introduce the category similarity score, which is based 
on the HowNet taxonomy distance (Liu and Li, 2002):  
Sim(category1,category2) = 
+d
?
?  
Where d is the path length from category1 to category2 
in the taxonomy. ? is an adjusting parameter, which 
controls the curvature of the similarity score. We set 
?=1.6 in our work following the experiment results in  
(Liu and Li, 2002). If the similarity of category p and 
one of the top three categories is higher than a threshold 
t, the category p is also considered as a valid category 
for the frame. 
 
In our example, some valid categories, such as ?firing|
??? is not selected in the previous step even though it 
is related to the ?cause_harm? frame. Based on the 
HowNet taxonomy, the similarity score between ?firing|
??? and ?beat|?? is 1.0, which we consider as high.  
Hence, ?firing|??? is also chosen as a valid category 
and the concepts in this category are linked to the 
?beat.v? lexical entry in the ?cause_harm? frame. How-
ever, using taxonomy distance can cause erros such as 
? in the ?weave? category to be aligned to ?beat.v? in 
the ?cause_harm? frame.

4 Evaluation   
We evaluate our work by comparing the results to a 
manually set golden standard of links for the most am-
biguous lexical entries in FrameNet, and use the preci-
sion and recall rate as evaluation criteria. To show the 
lower bound of the system performance, we chose six 
FrameNet lexical entries with the most links to HowNet 
concepts as the test set. Since each link is a word sense, 
these lexical entries have the most ambiguous transla-
tions.  Such lexical entries also turned out to be mostly 
verbs. Since the number of lexical entries in a FrameNet 
parent frame (i.e. frame size) is an important factor in 
the disambiguation step, we analyze our results by dis-
tinguishing between ?small frame?s (a frame with less 
than 5 lexical entries) and ?large frame?s. 24% of the 
frames are ?small frames?. Results in Tables 2 and 3 
have a weighted average of 
(0.649*0.24+0.874*0.76)=82% F-measure.

5 Conclusion and Discussion  
The alignment results can be found at 
http://www.cs.ust.hk/~hltc/BiFrameNet. Our evaluation 
shows that our method has achieved an 82% average F-
measure in aligning the most ambiguous FrameNet lexi-
cal entries to HowNet concepts. This paper describes 
the first stage in our project towards creating a bi-
lingual English-Chinese FrameNet, by aligning lexical 
entries between FrameNet and HowNet. The next step is 
to automatically extract semantically annotated Chinese 
sentences based on the annotated English sentences in 
FrameNet, the aligned FrameNet lexical entries, and 
bilingual corpora. We expect the final bilingual Frame-
Net will provide a valuable resource for multi-lingual or 
cross-lingual natural language processing.

Abstract 
We propose a robust method of auto-
matically constructing a bilingual word 
sense dictionary from readily available 
monolingual ontologies by using esti-
mation-maximization, without any an-
notated training data or manual tuning. 
We demonstrate our method on the 
English FrameNet and Chinese HowNet 
structures. Owing to the robustness of 
EM iterations in improving translation 
likelihoods, our word sense translation 
accuracies are very high, at 82% on av-
erage, for the 11 most ambiguous words 
in the English FrameNet with 5 senses 
or more. We also carried out a pilot 
study on using this automatically gener-
ated bilingual word sense dictionary to 
choose the best translation candidates 
and show the first significant evidence 
that frame semantics are useful for 
translation disambiguation. Translation 
disambiguation accuracy using frame 
semantics is 75%, compared to 15% by 
using dictionary glossing only.  These 
results demonstrate the great potential 
for future application of bilingual frame 
semantics to machine translation tasks.  
1 Introduction 
As early as in the 1950s, semantic nets were in-
vented as an ?interlingua? for machine transla-
tion.  
The ?semantic net? or ?semantic map? that 
humans possess in the cognitive process is a 
structure of concept classes and lexicon (Illes and 
Francis 1999). In addition, the frame-semantic 
representation of predicate-argument relations 
has gained much attention in the research com-
munity. The Berkeley FrameNet (Baker et al 
1998) is such an example.  
We suggest that in addition to dictionaries, bi-
lingual frame semantics (word sense dictionary) 
is a useful resource for lexical selection in the 
translation process of a statistical machine trans-
lation system. Manual inspection of the contras-
tive error analysis data from a state-of-the-art 
SMT system showed that around 20% of the er-
ror sentences produced could have been avoided 
if the correct predicate argument information was 
used (Och et al 2003). Therefore, frame seman-
tics can provide another layer of translation dis-
ambiguation in these systems. 
We therefore propose to generate a bilingual 
frame semantics mapping (word sense diction-
ary), simulating the ?semantic map? in a bilin-
gual speaker. Other questions of interest to us 
include how concept classes in English and Chi-
nese break down and map to each other.  
This paper is organized as follows. In section 
2, we present the one-frame-two-languages idea 
of bilingual frame semantics representation. In 
section 3, we explain the EM algorithm for gen-
erating a bilingual ontology fully automatically. 
In section 4, we present an evaluation on word 
sense translation. Section 5 describes an evalua-
tion on how well  bilingual frame semantics can 
improve translation disambiguation. We then 
discuss related work in section 6, conclude in 
section 7, and finally discuss future work in sec-
tion 8. 
2 One Frame Two Languages  
The challenge of translation disambiguation is to 
select the target word cl* with the correct seman-
tic frame f--(cl,f), among the multitude of transla-
tion candidates Pr(cl|el). We suggest that while a 
source word in the input sentence might have 
multiple translation candidates, the correct target 
word must have the same sense, i.e., belong to 
the same semantic frame, as the source word (i.e. 
Pr(cl,f|el,f) is high). For example, ?burn| ?

(tang)? carries the ?cause_harm|damage? 
sense, whereas ?burn|? (shao)? carries the 
?heat|cooking? sense. The source sentence ?My 
hands are burned? has the 
?cause_harm|damage? sense, therefore the cor-
rect translation of ?burn? is ??(tang)? not 
??(shao)?. The frame semantics information 
of the source word can thus lead to the best trans-
lation candidate. 
Whereas some translation ambiguities are 
preserved over languages, most are not. In par-
ticular, for languages as different as English and 
Chinese, there is little overlap between how lexi-
con is broken-down (Ploux and Ji 2003). Some 
cognitive scientists suggest that a bilingual 
speaker tends to group concepts in a single se-
mantic map and simply attach different words in 
English and Chinese to the categories in this 
map.  
Based on the above, we propose the one-
frame-two-languages idea for constructing a bi-
lingual word sense dictionary from monolingual 
ontologies.  
FrameNet (Baker et al 1998) is a collection of 
lexical entries grouped by frame semantics. Each 
lexical entry represents an individual word sense, 
and is associated with semantic roles and some 
annotated sentences. Lexical entries with the 
same semantic roles are grouped into a ?frame? 
and the semantic roles are called ?frame ele-
ments?. Each frame in FrameNet is a concept 
class and a single word sense belongs to only one 
frame. However, the Chinese HowNet represents 
a hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chi-
nese.  
HowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) is a Chinese 
ontology with a graph structure of word senses 
called ?concepts?, and each concept contains 7 
fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-
lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and 
English, and a definition of the concept including 
its category and semantic relations (Dong and 
Dong, 2000). Whereas HowNet concepts corre-
spond roughly to FrameNet lexical entries, its 
semantic relations do not correspond directly to 
FrameNet semantic roles.  
A bilingual frame, as shown in Figure 1, 
simulates the semantic system of a bilingual 
speaker by having lexical items in two languages 
attached to the frame.   
3 Automatic Generation of Bilingual 
Frame Semantics 
To choose ?burn|?(tang)? instead of ?burn|?
(shao)?in the translation of ?My hands are 
burned?, we need to know that  ??(tang)? 
belongs to the ?cause_harm? frame, but ??
(shao)? belongs to the ?heat? frame. In other 
words, we need to have a bilingual frame seman-
tics ontology. Much like a dictionary, this bilin-
gual ontology forms part of the translation 
?lexicon?, and can be used either by human 
translators or automatic translation systems.  
Such a bilingual frame semantics ontology 
also provides a simulation of the ?concept lexi-
con" of a bilingual person, as suggested by cog-
nitive scientists.  
Figure 1 shows an example of a bilingual 
frame that possibly corresponds to the semantic 
structure in a bilingual person. 
 
 
Figure 1. An example bilingual frame 
 
 
We previously proposed using the Chinese 
HowNet and a bilingual lexicon to map the Eng-
lish FrameNet into a bilingual BiFrameNet (Fung 
and Chen 2004). We used a combination of 
frame size thresholding and taxonomy distance 
to obtain the final alignment between FrameNet 
frames and HowNet categories, to generate the 
BiFrameNet.  
Our previous algorithm had the disadvantage 
of requiring the ad hoc tuning of thresholds. This 
results in poor performance on lexical entries 
from small frames (i.e. frames with very few 
lexical entries). The tuning process also means 
that a development set of annotated data is 
needed. In this paper, we propose a fully auto-
matic estimation-maximization algorithm in-
stead, to generate a similar FrameNet to HowNet 
240
bilingual ontology, without requiring any anno-
tated data or manual tuning. As such, our method 
can be applied to ontologies of any structure, and 
is not restricted to FrameNet or HowNet.  
Our approach is based on the following as-
sumptions: 
1. A source semantic frame is mapped to a tar-
get semantic frame if many word senses in 
the two frames translate to each other; 
2. A source word sense translates into a target 
word sense if their parent frames map to each 
other.  
The semantic frame in FrameNet is defined 
as a single frame, whereas in HowNet it is de-
fined as the category.  The formulae of our pro-
posed algorithm are listed in Figure 2.  
 
Variable definitions:  
cl : Chinese lexeme . 
cf : Chinese frame. 
(cl, cf) : the word sense entry in cf . 
el : English lexeme . 
ef : English frame.  
(el, ef) : the word sense entry in ef . 
(All variables are assumed to be independent of 
each other.) 
 
Model  parameters: 
Pr(cl|el): bilingual word pair probability from 
dictionary 
Pr(cf|ef): Chinese to English frame mapping 
probability. 
Pr(cl,cf|el,ef): Chinese to English word sense 
translation probability.

Figure 2. The bilingual frame semantics formulae 
 
In the initialization step of our EM algorithm, all 
English words in FrameNet are glossed into Chi-
nese using a bilingual lexicon with uniform 
probabilities Pr(cl|el). Next, we apply the EM 
algorithm to align FrameNet frames and HowNet 
categories. By using EM, we improve the prob-
abilities of frame mapping in Pr(cf|ef) and word 
sense translations in Pr(cl,cf|el,ef) iteratively: We 
estimate sense translations based on uniform bi-
lingual dictionary probabilities Pr(cl|el) first. 
The frame mappings are maximized by using the 
estimated sense translation. The a priori lexical 
probability Pr(cl) is assumed to be one for all 
Chinese words. Underlining the correctness of 
our algorithm, we note that the overall likeli-
hoods of the model parameters in our algorithm 
improve until convergence after 11 iterations. 
We use the alignment output after the conver-
gence step. That is, we obtain all word sense 
translations and frame mapping from the EM 
algorithm:

The mapping between FrameNet frames and 
HowNet categories is obviously not one-to-one 
since the two languages are different. The initial 
and final mappings before and after EM itera-
tions are shown in Figures 3a,b and 4a,b. Each 
point (i,j) in Figures 3a and b represents an 
alignment between FrameNet frame i to HowNet 
category j.  Before EM iterations, each English 
lexical item is glossed into its (multiple) Chinese 
translations by a bilingual dictionary. The parent 
frame of the English lexical item and those of all 
its Chinese translations are aligned to form an 
initial mapping. This initial mapping shows that 
each English FrameNet frame is aligned to an 
average of 56 Chinese HowNet categories. This 
mapping is clearly noisy. After EM iterations, 
each English frame is aligned to 5 Chinese cate-
gories on average, and each Chinese category is 
aligned to 1.58 English frames on average.

iterations.

iterations. 
 
We also plot the histograms of one-to-X 
mapping between FrameNet frames and HowNet 
categories before and after EM iterations in Fig-
ure 4. The horizontal axis is the number X in 
one-to-X mapping between English and Chinese 
frames. The vertical axis is the occurrence fre-
quency. For example, point (i,j) represents that 
there are j frames in English mapping to i catego-
ries in Chinese. Figure 4 shows that using lexical 
glossing only, there are a large number of frames 
that are aligned to over 150 of Chinese catego-
ries, while only a small number of English 
frames align to relatively few Chinese categories. 
After EM iterations, the majority of the English 
frames align to only a few Chinese categories, 
significantly improving the frame mapping 
across the two languages.

English frames and Chinese categories. Most English 
frames align to a lot of Chinese categories before EM 
learning.

English frames and Chinese categories. Most English 
frames only align to a few Chinese categories after

The above plots demonstrate the difference 
between FrameNet and HowNet structures. For 
example, ?boy.n? belongs to ?attention_getting? 
and ?people? frames in FrameNet. 
?boy.n|attention_getting? should translate into ?
??/waiter? in Chinese, whereas ?boy.n|people? 
has the sense of ???/male child?. However, 
in HowNet, both ???/waiter? and ???/male 
child? belong to the same category, human|?.

An example of word sense translation from our 
algorithm output is shown in Figure 5. The word 
sense translations of the FrameNet lexical entries 
represent the simulated semantic world of a bi-
lingual person who uses the same semantic struc-
ture but with lexical access in two languages. For 
example, the frame ?cause_harm? now contains 
the bilingual word sense pair 
?burn.v,cause_harm --> ?.v,damage|?? ?; 
and the frame ?experience_bodily_harm? con-
tains the bilingual word sense pair 
?burn.v,experience_bodily_harm --> ?
?.v,wounded|???.   
4 Robust Word Sense Translation Using 
Frame Semantics 
We evaluate the accuracy of word sense transla-
tion in our automatically generated bilingual on-
tology,  by testing on the most ambiguous lexical 
entries in FrameNet, i.e. words with the highest 
number of frames. These words and some of 
their sense translations are shown in Table 1 be-
low.

tie.v,cause_confinement -> ??.v,restrain|??  
tie.v,cognitive_connection -> ??.v,connect|?

feel.v,perception_active -> ??.v,perception|?
? 
feel.v,seeking -> ?.v,LookFor|? 
 
Table 1. Example word sense translation out-
put 
 
The word sense translation accuracies of the 
above words are shown in Table 2. The results 
are highly positive given that those from previ-
ous work in word translation disambiguation us-
ing bootstrapping methods (Li and Li, 2003; 
Yarowsky 1995) achieved 80-90% accuracy in 
disambiguating between only two senses per 
word1.  
The only susceptibility of our algorithm is in 
its reliance on bilingual dictionaries. The sense 
translations of the words ?tie?, ?roll?, and ?look? 
are relatively less accurate due to the absence of 
certain translations in the dictionaries we used. 
For example, the ?bread/food? sense of the word 
?roll? is not found in the bilingual dictionaries at 
all.

1 We are not able to evaluate our algorithm on the same 
set of words as in (Li & Li 2003; Yarowsky 1995) since 
these words do not have entries in FrameNet.  
 
243
perform well on lexical entries from small frames 
(e.g. on ?hold.v? and ?issue.v?) due to ad hoc 
manual thresholding, the current method is fully 
automatic and therefore more robust.  In Fung 
and Chen (2004), semantic frames are mapped to 
each other if their lexical entries translate to each 
other above a certain threshold. If the frames are 
small and therefore do not contain many lexical 
entries, then these frames might not be correctly 
mapped. If the parent concept classes are not cor-
rectly mapped, then word sense translation accu-
racy suffers.  
The main advantage of our algorithm over our 
work in 2004 lies in the hill-climbing iterations 
of the EM algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, 
all concept classes are mapped with a certain 
probability, so no mapping is filtered out prema-
turely. As the algorithm iterates, it is more prob-
able for the correct bilingual word sense to be 
translated to each other, and it is also more prob-
able for the bilingual concept classes to be 
mapped to each other. After convergence of the 
algorithm, the output probabilities are optimal 
and the translation results are more accurate.  
5 Towards Translation Disambiguation 
using Frame Semantics  
As translation disambiguation forms the core of 
various machine translation strategies, we are 
interested in studying whether the generated bi-
lingual frame semantics can complement existing 
resources, such as bilingual dictionaries, for 
translation disambiguation.  
The semantic frame of the predicate verb and 
the argument structures in a sentence can be 
identified by the syntactic structure, part-of-
speech tags, head word, and other features in the 
sentence. The predicate verb translation corre-
sponds to the word sense translation we de-
scribed in the previous sections, Pr(cl,cf | el,ef).   
We intend to evaluate the effectiveness of bi-
lingual frame semantics mapping in disambiguat-
ing between translation candidates. For the 
evaluation set, we use 202 randomly selected 
example sentences from FrameNet, which have 
been annotated with predicate-argument struc-
tures.  
In the first step of the experiment, for each 
predicate word (el,ef), we find all its translation 
candidates of the predicate word in each sen-
tence, and annotate them with their HowNet 
categories to form a translated word sense 
Pr(cl,cf|el,ef). For the example sentence in Fig-
ure 6, there are altogether 147 word sense trans-
lations for (hold,detaining).  
 
Under South African law police could HOLD the man 
for questioning for up to 48 hours before seeking the 
permission of magistrates for an extension

#  ??,own|? ? 
 
Figure 6. A FrameNet example sentence and predicate verb 
translations {Pr(cl,cf|el,ef)}.  
 
We then find the word sense translation with 
the highest probability among all HowNet and 
FrameNet class mappings from our EM algo-
rithm:

 An example (el,ef) is (hold, detaining) and the 
cl*=argmax P(cl,cf|el,ef) found by our program 
is??. (cl,cf)* in this case is (??,detain|??). 
Human evaluators then look at the set of {cl*} 
and mark cl* as either true translations or erro-
neous. The accuracy of word sense translations 
on this evaluation set of example sentences is at 
74.9%.  
In comparison, we also look at Pr(cl|el), trans-
lation based on bilingual dictionary only, and 
find 
244

The translation accuracy of using bilingual 
dictionary only, is at a predictable low 15.8%.  
Our results are the first significant evidence 
of, in addition to bilingual dictionaries, bilingual 
frame semantics is a useful resource for the 
translation disambiguation task.  
6 Related Work 
The most relevant previous works include word 
sense translation and translation disambiguation 
(Li & Li 2003; Cao & Li 2002; Koehn and 
Knight 2000; Kikui 1999; Fung et al, 1999), 
frame semantic induction (Green et al, 2004; 
Fung & Chen 2004), and bilingual semantic 
mapping (Fung & Chen 2004; Huang et al 2004; 
Ploux & Ji, 2003, Ngai et al, 2002; Palmer & 
Wu 1995).  Other than the English FrameNet 
(Baker et al 1998), we also note the construction 
of the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats & Petruck, 
2003), the Japanese FrameNet (Ikeda 1998), and 
the German FrameNet (Boas, 2002). In terms of 
learning method, Chen and Palmer (2004) also 
used EM learning to cluster Chinese verb senses.  
Word Sense Translation  
Previous word sense translation methods are 
based on using context information to improve 
translation. These methods look at the context 
words and discourse surrounding the source 
word and use methods ranging from  boostrap-
ping (Li & Li 2003), EM iterations (Cao and Li, 
2002; Koehn and Knight 2000),  and the cohe-
sive relation between the source sentence and 
translation candidates (Fung et al 1999; Kikui 
1999).   
Our proposed translation disambiguation 
method compares favorably to (Li & Li 2003) in 
that we obtain an average of 82% precision on 
words with multiple senses, whereas they ob-
tained precisions of 80-90% on words with two 
senses. Our results also compare favorably to 
(Fung et al 1999; Kikui 1999) as the precision of 
our predicate verb in the input sentence transla-
tion disambiguation is about 75% whereas their 
precisions range from 40% to 80%, albeit on an 
independent set of words.  
Automatic Generation of Frame Semantics  
Green et al (2004) induced SemFrame automati-
cally and compared it favorably to the hand-
constructed FrameNet (83.2% precision in cover-
ing the FrameNet frames). They map WordNet 
and LDOCE, two semantic resources, to obtain 
SemFrame. Burchardt et al (2005) used Frame-
Net in combination with WordNet to extend cov-
erage. 
Bilingual Semantic Mapping 
Ploux and Ji, (2003) proposed a spatial model for 
matching semantic values between French and 
English. Palmer and Wu (1995) studied the map-
ping of change-of-state English verbs to Chinese. 
Dorr et al (2002) described a technique for the 
construction of a Chinese-English verb lexicon 
based on HowNet and the English LCS Verb Da-
tabase (LVD). They created links between 
HowNet concepts and LVD verb classes using 
both statistics and a manually constructed ?seed 
mapping? of thematic classes between HowNet 
and LVD. Ngai et al (2002) induced bilingual 
semantic network from WordNet and HowNet. 
They used lexical neighborhood information in a 
word-vector based approach to create the align-
ment between WordNet and HowNet classes 
without any manual annotation. 
7 Conclusion 
Based on the one-frame-two-languages idea, 
which stems from the hypothesis of the mind of a 
bilingual speaker, we propose automatically gen-
erating a bilingual word sense dictionary or on-
tology. The bilingual ontology is generated from 
iteratively estimating and maximizing the prob-
ability of a word translation given frame map-
ping, and that of frame mapping given word 
translations. We have shown that for the most 
ambiguous 11 words in the English FrameNet, 
the average word sense translation accuracy is 
82%. Applying the bilingual ontology mapping 
to translation disambiguation of predicate verbs 
in another evaluation, the accuracy of our 
method is at an encouraging 75%, significantly 
better than the 15% accuracy of using bilingual 
dictionary only. Most importantly, we have dem-
onstrated that bilingual frame semantics is poten-
tially useful for cross-lingual retrieval, machine-
aided and machine translation.  
8 Future Work 
Our evaluation exercise has shown the promise 
of using bilingual frame semantics for translation 
task. We are currently carrying out further work 
in the aspects of (1) improving the accuracy of 
source word frame identification and (2) incorpo-
rating bilingual frame semantics in a full fledged 
245
machine translation system. In addition, Frame-
Net has a relatively poor coverage of lexical en-
tries. It would be necessary to apply either semi-
automatic or automatic methods such as those in 
(Burchardt et al 2005, Green et al2004) to ex-
tend FrameNet coverage for final application to 
machine translation tasks. Last but not the least, 
we are interested in applying our method to other 
ontologies such as the one used for the Propbank 
data, as well as to other language pairs.
