Abstract
This paper describes the TALP participa-
tion in the WMT13 evaluation campaign.
Our participation is based on the combi-
nation of several statistical machine trans-
lation systems: based on standard phrase-
based Moses systems. Variations include
techniques such as morphology genera-
tion, training sentence filtering, and do-
main adaptation through unit derivation.
The results show a coherent improvement
on TER, METEOR, NIST, and BLEU
scores when compared to our baseline sys-
tem.
1 Introduction
The TALP-UPC center (Center for Language and
Speech Technologies and Applications at Univer-
sitat Polite`cnica de Catalunya) focused on the En-
glish to Spanish translation of the WMT13 shared
task.
Our primary (contrastive) run is an internal
system selection comprised of different train-
ing approaches (without CommonCrawl, unless
stated): (a) Moses Baseline (Koehn et al,
2007b), (b) Moses Baseline + Morphology Gener-
ation (Formiga et al, 2012b), (c) Moses Baseline
+ News Adaptation (Henr??quez Q. et al, 2011),
(d) Moses Baseline + News Adaptation + Mor-
phology Generation , and (e) Moses Baseline +
News Adaptation + Filtered CommonCrawl Adap-
tation (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al, 2013). Our sec-
ondary run includes is the full training strategy
marked as (e) in the previous description.
The main differences with respect to our last
year?s participation (Formiga et al, 2012a) are: i)
the inclusion of the CommonCrawl corpus, using
a sentence filtering technique and the system com-
bination itself, and ii) a system selection scheme
to select the best translation among the different
configurations.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the phrase-based system and the main
pipeline of our baseline system. Section 3 de-
scribes the our approaches to improve the baseline
system on the English-to-Spanish task (special at-
tention is given to the approaches that differ from
last year). Section 4 presents the system combi-
nation approach once the best candidate phrase of
the different subsystems are selected. Section 5
discusses the obtained results considering both in-
ternal and official test sets. Section 6 includes con-
clusions and further work.
2 Baseline system: Phrase-Based SMT
Our contribution is a follow up of our last year par-
ticipation (Formiga et al, 2012a), based on a fac-
tored Moses from English to Spanish words plus
their Part-of-Speech (POS). Factored corpora aug-
ments words with additional information, such as
POS tags or lemmas. In that case, factors other
than surface (e.g. POS) are usually less sparse, al-
lowing the construction of factor-specific language
models with higher-order n-grams. Such language
models can help to obtain syntactically more cor-
rect outputs.
We used the standard models available in Moses
as feature functions: relative frequencies, lexi-
cal weights, word and phrase penalties, wbe-msd-
bidirectional-fe reordering models, and two lan-
guage models (one for surface and one for POS
tags). Phrase scoring was computed using Good-
Turing discounting (Foster et al, 2006).
As aforementioned, we developed five factored
Moses-based independent systems with different
134
approaches. We explain them in Section 3. As
a final decision, we applied a system selection
scheme (Formiga et al, 2013; Specia et al, 2010)
to consider the best candidate for each sentence,
according to human trained quality estimation
(QE) models. We set monotone reordering of
the punctuation signs for the decoding using the
Moses wall feature.
We tuned the systems using the Moses
MERT (Och, 2003) implementation. Our focus
was on minimizing the BLEU score (Papineni et
al., 2002) of the development set. Still, for ex-
ploratory purposes, we tuned configuration (c) us-
ing PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) to set the ini-
tial weights at every iteration of the MERT algo-
rithm. However, it showed no significant differ-
ences compared to the original MERT implemen-
tation.
We trained the baseline system using all
the available parallel corpora, except for
common-crawl. That is, European Parlia-
ment (EPPS) (Koehn, 2005), News Commentary,
and United Nations. Regarding the monolingual
data, there were more News corpora organized
by years for Spanish. The data is available at
the Translation Task?s website1. We used all
the News corpora to busld the language model
(LM). Firstly, a LM was built for every corpus
independently. Afterwards, they were combined
to produce de final LM.
For internal testing we used the News 2011 and
News 2012 data and concatenated the remaining
three years of News data as a single parallel corpus
for development.
We processed the corpora as in our participa-
tion to WMT12 (Formiga et al, 2012a). Tok-
enization and POS-tagging in both Spanish and
English was obtained with FreeLing (Padro? et al,
2010). Stemming was carried out with Snow-
ball (Porter, 2001). Words were conditionally case
folded based on their POS: proper nouns and ad-
jectives were separated from other categories to
determine whether a string should be fully folded
(no special property), partially folded (noun or ad-
jective) or not folded at all in (acronym).
Bilingual corpora was filtered with the clean-
corpus-n script of Moses (Koehn et al, 2007a), re-
moving those pairs in which a sentence was longer
than 70. For the CommonCrawl corpus we used a
more complex filtering step (cf. Section 3.3).
1http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/translation-task.html
Postprocessing included two special scripts to
recover contractions and clitics. Detruecasing was
done forcing the capitals after the punctuation
signs. Furthermore we used an additional script in
order to check the casing of output names with re-
spect to the source. We reused our language mod-
els and alignments (with stems) from WMT12.
3 Improvement strategies
We tried three different strategies to improve the
baseline system. Section 3.1 shows a strategy
based on morphology simplification plus genera-
tion. Its aim is dealing with the problems raised
by morphology-rich languages, such as Spanish.
Section 3.2 presents a domain?adaptation strategy
that consists of deriving new units. Section 3.3
presents an advanced strategy to filter the good bi-
sentences from the CommonCrawl corpus, which
might be useful to perform the domain adaptation.
3.1 Morphology generation
Following the success of our WMT12 participa-
tion (Formiga et al, 2012a), our first improve-
ment is based on the morphology generalization
and generation approach (Formiga et al, 2012b).
We focus our strategy on simplifying verb forms
only.
The approach first translates into Spanish sim-
plified forms (de Gispert and Marin?o, 2008). The
final inflected forms are predicted through a mor-
phology generation step, based on the shallow
and deep-projected linguistic information avail-
able from both source and target language sen-
tences.
Lexical sparseness is a crucial aspect to deal
with for an open-domain robust SMT when trans-
lating to morphology-rich languages (e.g. Span-
ish) . We knew beforehand (Formiga et al, 2012b)
that morphology generalization is a good method
to deal with generic translations and it provides
stability to translations of the training domain.
Our morphology prediction (generation) sys-
tems are trained with the WMT13 corpora (Eu-
roparl, News, and UN) together with noisy data
(OpenSubtitles). This combination helps to obtain
better translations without compromising the qual-
ity of the translation models. These kind of mor-
phology generation systems are trained with a rel-
atively short amount of parallel data compared to
standard SMT training corpora.
Our main enhancement to this strategy is the
135
addition of source-projected deep features to the
target sentence in order to perform the morphol-
ogy prediction. These features are Dependency
Features and Semantic Role Labelling, obtained
from the source sentence through Lund Depen-
dency Parser2. These features are then projected
to the target sentence as explained in (Formiga et
al., 2012b).
Projected deep features are important to pre-
dict the correct verb morphology from clean and
fluent text. However, the projection of deep fea-
tures is sentence-fluency sensitive, making it un-
reliable when the baseline MT output is poor. In
other words, the morphology generation strategy
becomes more relevant with high-quality MT de-
coders, as their output is more fluent, making the
shallow and deep features more reliable classifier
guides.
3.2 Domain Adaptation through pivot
derived units
Usually the WMT Translation Task focuses on
adapting a system to a news domain, offering an
in-domain parallel corpus to work with. How-
ever this corpus is relatively small compared to
the other corpora. In our previous participation
we demonstrated the need of performing a more
aggressive domain adaptation strategy. Our strat-
egy was based on using in-domain parallel data to
adapt the translation model, but focusing on the
decoding errors that the out-of-domain baseline
system makes when translating the in-domain cor-
pus.
The idea is to identify the system mistakes and
use the in-domain data to learn how to correct
them. To that effect, we interpolate the transla-
tion models (phrase and lexical reordering tables)
with a new adapted translation model with derived
units. We obtained the units identifying the mis-
matching parts between the non-adapted transla-
tion and the actual reference (Henr??quez Q. et al,
2011). This derivation approach uses the origi-
nal translation as a pivot to find a word-to-word
alignment between the source side and the target
correction (word-to-word alignment provided by
Moses during decoding).
The word-to-word monolingual alignment be-
tween output translation target correction was ob-
tained combining different probabilities such as
i)lexical identity, ii) TER-based alignment links,

iii) lexical model probabilities, iv) char-based Lev-

We empirically set the linear interpolation
weight as w = 0.60 for the baseline translation
models and w = 0.40 for the derived units trans-
lations models. We applied the pivot derived units
strategy to the News domain and to the filtered
Commoncrawl corpus (cf. Section 5). The proce-
dure to filter out the Commoncrawl corpus is ex-
plained next.
3.3 CommonCrawl Filtering
We used the CommonCrawl corpus, provided for
the first time by the organization, as an impor-
tant source of information for performing aggres-
sive domain adaptation. To decrease the impact
of the noise in the corpus, we performed an auto-
matic pre-selection of the supposedly more correct
(hence useful) sentence pairs: we applied the au-
tomatic quality estimation filters developed in the
context of the FAUST project3. The filters? pur-
pose is to identify cases in which the post-editions
provided by casual users really improve over auto-
matic translations.
The adaptation to the current framework is as
follows. Example selection is modelled as a bi-
nary classification problem. We consider triples
(src, ref , trans), where src and ref stand for the
source-reference sentences in the CommonCrawl
corpus and trans is an automatic translation of the
source, generated by our baseline SMT system. A
triple is assigned a positive label iff ref is a bet-
ter translation from src than trans. That is, if the
translation example provided by CommonCrawl is
better than the output of our baseline SMT system.
We used four feature sets to characterize the
three sentences and their relationships: sur-
face, back-translation, noise-based and similarity-
based. These features try to capture (a) the simi-
larity between the different texts on the basis of
3http://www.faust-fp7.eu
136
diverse measures, (b) the length of the different
sentences (including ratios), and (c) the likelihood
of a source or target text to include noisy text.4
Most of them are simple, fast-calculation and
language-independent features. However, back-
translation features require that trans and ref are
back-translated into the source language. We did
it by using the TALP es-en system from WMT12.
Considering these features, we trained lin-
ear Support Vector Machines using SVMlight
(Joachims, 1999). Our training collection was the
FFF+ corpus, with +500 hundred manually anno-
tated instances (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al, 2013). No
adaptation to CommonCrawl was performed. To
give an idea, classification accuracy over the test
partition of the FFF+ corpus was only moderately
good (?70%). However, ranking by classification
score a fresh set of over 6,000 new examples, and
selecting the top ranked 50% examples to enrich a
state-of-the-art SMT system, allowed us to signifi-
cantly improve translation quality (Barro?n-Ceden?o
et al, 2013).
For WMT13, we applied these classifiers to
rank the CommonCrawl translation pairs and then
selected the top 53% instances to be processed by
the domain adaptation strategy. Table 1 displays
the corpus statistics before and after filtering.
4 System Combination
We approached system combination as a system
selection task. More concretely, we applied Qual-
ity Estimation (QE) models (Specia et al, 2010;
Formiga et al, 2013) to select the highest qual-
ity translation at sentence level among the trans-
lation candidates obtained by our different strate-
gies. The QE models are trained with human
supervision, making use of no system-dependent
features.
In a previous study (Formiga et al, 2013),
we showed the plausibility of building reliable
system-independent QE models from human an-
notations. This type of task should be addressed
with a pairwise ranking strategy, as it yields bet-
ter results than an absolute quality estimation ap-
proach (i.e., regression) for system selection. We
also found that training the quality estimation
models from human assessments, instead of au-
tomatic reference scores, helped to obtain better

2013) for a detailed description of features, process, and eval-
uation.
models for system selection for both i) mimicking
the behavior of automatic metrics and ii) learning
the human behavior when ranking different trans-
lation candidates.
For training the QE models we used the data
from the WMT13 shared task on quality estima-
tion (System Selection Quality Estimation at Sen-
tence Level task5), which contains the test sets
from other WMT campaigns with human assess-
ments. We used five groups of features, namely:
i) QuestQE: 17 QE features provided by the Quest
toolkit6; ii) AsiyaQE: 26 QE features provided by
the Asiya toolkit for MT evaluation (Gime?nez and
Ma`rquez, 2010a); iii) LM (and LM-PoS) perplex-
ities trained with monolingual data; iv) PR: Clas-
sical lexical-based measures -BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), and ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011)- computed
with a pseudo-reference approach, that is, using
the other system candidates as references (Sori-
cut and Echihabi, 2010); and v) PROTHER: Ref-
erence based metrics provided by Asiya, including
GTM, ROUGE, PER, TER (Snover et al, 2008),
and syntax-based evaluation measures also with a
pseudo-reference approach.
We trained a Support Vector Machine ranker by
means of pairwise comparison using the SVMlight
toolkit (Joachims, 1999), but with the ?-z p? pa-
rameter, which can provide system rankings for
all the members of different groups. The learner
algorithm was run according to the following pa-
rameters: linear kernel, expanding the working set
by 9 variables at each iteration, for a maximum of
50,000 iterations and with a cache size of 100 for
kernel evaluations. The trade-off parameter was
empirically set to 0.001.
Table 2 shows the contribution of different fea-
ture groups when training the QE models. For
evaluating performance, we used the Asiya nor-
malized linear combination metric ULC (Gime?nez
and Ma`rquez, 2010b), which combines BLEU,
NIST, and METEOR (with exact, paraphrases and
synonym variants). Within this scenario, it can
be observed that the quality estimation features
(QuestQE and AsiyaQE) did not obtain good re-
sults, perhaps because of the high similarity be-
tween the test candidates (Moses with different
configurations) in contrast to the strong differ-
ence between the candidates in training (Moses,

RBMT, Jane, etc.). On the contrary, the pseudo-
reference-based features play a crucial role in the
proper performance of the QE model, confirming
the hypothesis that PR features need a clear dom-
inant system to be used as reference. The PR-
based configurations (with and without LM) had
no big differences between them. We choose the
best AVG result for the final system combination:
PR+PROTHER+LM, which it is consistent with
the actual WMT13 evaluated afterwards.
5 Results
Evaluations were performed considering different
quality measures: BLEU, NIST, TER, and ME-
TEOR in addition to an informal manual analy-
sis. This manifold of metrics evaluates distinct as-
pects of the translation. We evaluated both over
the WMT11 and WMT12 test sets as internal in-
dicators of our systems. We also give our perfor-
mance on the WMT13 test dataset.
Table 3 presents the obtained results for the
different strategies: (a) Moses Baseline (w/o
commoncrawl) (b) Moses Baseline+Morphology
Generation (w/o commoncrawl) (c) Moses Base-
line+News Adaptation through pivot based align-
ment (w/o commoncrawl) (d) Moses Baseline +
News Adaptation (b) + Morphology Generation
(c) (e) Moses Baseline + News Adaptation (b) +
Filtered CommonCrawl Adaptation.
The official results are in Table 4. Our primary
(contrastive) run is the system combination strat-
egy whereas our secondary run is the full training
strategy marked as (e) on the system combination.
Our primary system was ranked in the second clus-
ter out of ten constrained systems in the official
manual evaluation.
Independent analyzes of the improvement
strategies show that the highest improvement
comes from the CommonCrawl Filtering + Adap-
tation strategy (system e). The second best strat-
egy is the combination of the morphology pre-
diction system plus the news adaptation system.
However, for the WMT12 test the News Adap-
tation strategy contributes to main improvement
whereas for the WMT13 this major improvement
is achieved with the morphology strategy. Analyz-
ing the distance betweem each test set with respect
to the News and CommonCrawl domain to further
understand the behavior of each strategy seems an
interesting future work. Specifically, for further
contrasting the difference in the morphology ap-
proach, it would be nice to analyze the variation in
the verb inflection forms. Hypothetically, the per-
son or the number of the verb forms used may have
a higher tendency to be different in the WMT13
test set, implying that our morphology approach is
further exploited.
Regarding the system selection step (internal
WMT12 test), the only automatic metric that has
an improvement is TER. However, TER is one of

6 Conclusions and further work
This paper described the TALP-UPC participa-
tion for the English-to-Spanish WMT13 transla-
tion task. We applied the same systems as in last
year, but enhanced with new techniques: sentence
filtering and system combination.
Results showed that both approaches performed
better than the baseline system, being the sentence
filtering technique the one that most improvement
reached in terms of all the automatic quality indi-
cators: BLEU, NIST, TER, and METEOR. The
system combination was able to outperform the
independent systems which used morphological
knowledge and/or domain adaptation techniques.
As further work would like to focus on further
advancing on the morphology-based techniques.

Abstract
This paper describes the TALP-UPC par-
ticipation in the WMT?13 Shared Task
on Quality Estimation (QE). Our partic-
ipation is reduced to task 1.2 on System
Selection. We used a broad set of fea-
tures (86 for German-to-English and 97
for English-to-Spanish) ranging from stan-
dard QE features to features based on
pseudo-references and semantic similarity.
We approached system selection by means
of pairwise ranking decisions. For that,
we learned Random Forest classifiers es-
pecially tailored for the problem. Evalua-
tion at development time showed consider-
ably good results in a cross-validation ex-
periment, with Kendall?s ? values around
0.30. The results on the test set dropped
significantly, raising different discussions
to be taken into account.
1 Introduction
In this paper we discuss the TALP-UPC1 partici-
pation in the WMT?13 Shared Task on Quality Es-
timation (QE). Our participation is circumscribed
to task 1.2, which deals with System Selection.
Concretely, we were required to rank up to five al-
ternative translations for the same source sentence
produced by multiple MT systems, in the absence
of any reference translation.
We used a broad set of features; mainly avail-
able through the last version of the ASIYA toolkit
for MT evaluation2 (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,
2010). Concretely, we derived 86 features for
the German-to-English subtask and 97 features for
English-to-Spanish. These features cover different
approaches and include standard Quality Estima-
tion features, as provided by the above mentioned
1Center for Language and Speech Technologies and Ap-
plications (TALP), Technical University of Catalonia (UPC).

ASIYA toolkit and Quest (Specia et al, 2010),
but also a variety of features based on pseudo-
references (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010), explicit
semantic analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch,
2007) and specialized language models. See sec-
tion 3 for details.
In order to model the ranking problem associ-
ated to the system selection task, we adapted it
to a classification task of pairwise decisions. We
trained Random Forest classifiers (and compared
them to SVM classifiers), expanding the work of
Formiga et al (2013), from which a full ranking
can be derived and the best system per sentence
identified.
Evaluation at development time, using cross-
validation, showed considerably good and stable
results for both language pairs, with correlation
values around 0.30 (Kendall ? coefficient) classi-
fication accuracies around 52% (pairwise classifi-
cation) and 41% (best translation identification).
Unfortunately, the results on the test set were sig-
nificantly lower. Current research is devoted to ex-
plain the behavior of the system at testing time. On
the one hand, it seems clear that more research re-
garding the assignment of ties is needed in order
to have a robust model. On the other hand, the re-
lease of the gold standard annotations for the test
set will facilitate a deeper analysis and understand-
ing of the current results.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the ranking models studied for
the system selection problem. Section 3 describes
the features used for learning. Section 4 presents
the setting for parameter optimization and feature
selection and the results obtained. Finally, Sec-
tion 5 summarizes the lessons learned so far and
outlines some lines for further research.
2 Ranking Model
We considered two learning strategies to obtain the
best translation ranking model: SVM and Random
359
Forests. Both strategies were based on predicting
pairwise quality ranking decisions by means of su-
pervised learning. These decision was motivated
from our previous work (Formiga et al, 2013)
were we learned that they were more consistent to
select the best system (according to human and au-
tomatic metrics) compared to absolute regression
approaches. In that work we used only the subset
of features 1, 2, 3 and 8 described in Section 3.
For this shared task we have introduced additional
similarity measures (subsets 4 to 7) that feature se-
mantic analysis and automatic alignments between
the source and the translations.
The rationale for transforming a ranking prob-
lem to a pairwise classification problem has been
described previously in several work (Joachims,
2002; Burges et al, 2005). The main idea is to en-
semble the features of both individuals and assign
a class {-1,1} which tries to predict the pairwise
relation among them. For linear based approach
this adaptation is as simple to compute the differ-
ence between features between all the pairs of the
training data.
We used two different learners to perform that
task. First, we trained a Support Vector Machine
ranker by means of pairwise comparison using
the SVMlight toolkit (Joachims, 1999), but with
the ?-z p? parameter, which can provide system
rankings for all the members of different groups.
The learner algorithm was run according to the
following parameters: RBF-kernel, expanding the
working set by 9 variables at each iteration, for a
maximum of 50,000 iterations and with a cache
size of 100 for kernel evaluations. The trade-off
parameter was empirically set to 0.001. This im-
plementation ignores the ties for the training step
as it only focuses in better than/ worse than rela-
tions.
Secondly, we used Random Forests (Breiman,
2001), the rationale was the same as ranking-to-
pairwise implementation from SVMlight. How-
ever, SVMlight considers two different data pre-
processing methods depending on the kernel of
the classifier: LINEAR and RBF-Kernel. We
used the same data-preprocessing algorithm from
SVMlight in order to train a Random Forest clas-
sifier with ties (three classes: {0,-1,1}) based
upon the pairwise relations. We used the Random
Forests implementation of scikit-learn toolkit (Pe-
dregosa et al, 2011) with 50 estimators.
Once the classes are given by the Random For-
est, we build a graph by means of the adjacency
matrix of the pairwise decision. Once the adja-
cency matrix has been built, we assign the final
ranking through a dominance scheme similar to
Pighin et al (2012). In that case, however, there
are not topological problems as the pairwise rela-
tions are complete across all the edges.
3 Features Sets
We considered a broad set of features: 97 and
86 features for English-to-Spanish (en-es) and
German-to-English (de-en), respectively. We
grouped them into the following categories: base-
line QE metrics, comparison against pseudo-
references, source-translation, and adapted lan-
guage models. We describe them below. Unless
noted otherwise, the features apply to both lan-
guage pairs.
3.1 Baseline Features
The baseline features are composed of well-known
quality estimation metrics:
1. Quest Baseline (QQE)
Seventeen baseline features from Specia et
al. (2010). This set includes token counts
(and their ratio), LM probabilities for source
and target sentences, percentage of n-grams
in different quartiles of a reference corpus,
number of punctuation marks, and fertility
ratios. We used these features in the en-es
partition only.
2. ASIYA?s QE-based features (AQE)
Twenty-six QE features provided by
ASIYA (Gonza`lez et al, 2012), comprising
bilingual dictionary ambiguity and overlap;
ratios concerning chunks, named-entities and
PoS; source and candidate LM perplexities
and inverse perplexities over lexical forms,
chunks and PoS; and out-of-vocabulary word
indicators.
3.2 Pseudo-Reference-based Features
Soricut and Echihabi (2010) introduced the con-
cept of pseudo-reference-based features (PR) for
translation ranking estimation. The principle is
that, in the lack of human-produced references,
automatic ones are still good for differentiating
good from bad translations. One or more sec-
ondary MT systems are required to generate trans-
lations starting from the same input, which are
360
taken as pseudo-references. The similarity to-
wards the pseudo-references can be calculated
with any evaluation measure or text similarity
function, which gives us all feature variants in this
group. We consider the following PR-based fea-
tures:
3. Derived from ASIYA?s metrics (APR)
Twenty-three PR features, including GTM-l
(l?{1,2,3}) to reward different length match-
ing (Melamed et al, 2003), four variants of
ROUGE (-L, -S*, -SU* and -W) (Lin and
Och, 2004), WER (Nie?en et al, 2000),
PER (Tillmann et al, 1997), TER, and
TERbase (i.e., without stemming, synonymy
look-up, nor paraphrase support) (Snover et
al., 2009), and all the shallow and full pars-
ing measures (i.e., constituency and depen-
dency parsing, PoS, chunking and lemmas)
that ASIYA provides either for Spanish or En-
glish as target languages.
4. Lexical similarity (NGM)
Cosine and Jaccard coefficient similarity
measures for both token and character
n-grams considering n ? [2, 5] (i.e., sixteen
features). Additionally, one Jaccard-based
similarity measure for ?pseudo-prefixes?
(considering only up to four initial characters
for every token).
5. Based on semantic information (SEM)
Twelve features calculated with named
entity- and semantic role-based evaluation
measures (again, provided by ASIYA). Sen-
tences are automatically annotated using
SwiRL (Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005) and
BIOS (Surdeanu et al, 2005). We used these
features in the de-en subtask only.
6. Explicit semantic analysis (ESA)
Two versions of explicit semantic analy-
sis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), a
semantic similarity measure, built on top of
Wikipedia (we used the opening paragraphs
of 100k Wikipedia articles as in 2010).
3.3 Source-Translation Extra Features
Source-translation features include explicit com-
parisons between the source sentence and its trans-
lation. They are meant to measure how adequate
the translation is, that is, to what extent the trans-
lation expresses the same meaning as the source.
Note that a considerable amount of the features
described in the baseline group (QQE and AQE)
fall in this category. In this subsection we include
some extra features we devised to capture source?
translation dependencies.
7. Alignment-based features (ALG / ALGPR)
One measure calculated over the aligned
words between a candidate translation and
the source (ALG); and two measures based on
the comparison between these alignments for
two different translations (e.g., candidate and
pseudo-reference) and the source (ALGPR).3
8. Length model (LeM)
A measure to estimate the quality likeli-
hood of a candidate sentence by considering
the ?expected length? of a proper translation
from the source. The measure was introduced
by (Pouliquen et al, 2003) to identify docu-
ment translations. We estimated its param-
eters over standard MT corpora, including
Europarl, Newswire, Newscommentary and
UN.
3.4 Adapted Language-Model Features
We interpolated different language models com-
prising the WMT?12 Monolingual corpora (EPPS,
News, UN and Gigafrench for English). The in-
terpolation weights were computed as to minimize
the perplexity according to the WMT Translation
Task test data (2008-2010)4. The features are as
follow:
9. Language Model Features (LM)
Two log-probabilities of the translation can-
didate with respect to the above described in-
terpolated language models over word forms
and PoS labels.
4 Experiments and Results
In this section we describe the experiments car-
ried out to select the best feature set, learner, and
learner configuration. Additionally, we present
the final performance within the task. The set-
up experiments were addressed doing two separate
10-fold cross validations on the training data and
averaging the final results. We evaluated the re-
sults through three indicators: Kendall?s ? with no

penalization for the ties, accuracy in determining
the pairwise relationship between candidate trans-
lations, and global accuracy in selecting the best
candidate for each source sentence.
First, we compared our SVM learner against
Random Forests with the two variants of data
preprocessing (LINEAR and RBF). In terms of
Kendall?s ? , we found that the Random Forests
(RF) were clearly better compared to SVM imple-
mentation. Concretely, depending on the final fea-
ture set, we found that RF achieved a ? between
0.23 and 0.29 while SVM achieved a ? between
0.23 and 0.25. With respect to the accuracy mea-
sures we did not find noticeable differences be-
tween methods as their results moved from 49% to
52%. However, considering the accuracy in terms
of selecting only the best system there was a dif-
ference of two points (42.2% vs. 40.0%) between
methods, being RF again the best system. Regard-
ing the pairwise preprocessing the results between
RBF and LINEAR based preprocessing were com-
parable, being RBF slightly better than LINEAR.
Hence, we selected Random Forests with RBF
pairwise preprocessing as our final learner.

Table 1: Set-up results for de-en
For the feature selection process, we considered
the most relevant combinations of feature groups.
Table 1 shows the set-up results for the de-en sub-
task and Table 2 shows the results for the en-es
subtask.
In terms of ? we observed similar results be-
tween the two language pairs. However accura-
cies for the de-en subtask were one point above
the ones for en-es. Regarding the features used, we
found that the best feature combination to use was
composed of: i) a baseline QE feature set (Asiya
or Quest) but not both of them, ii) Length Model,
iii) Pseudo-reference aligned based features and
the use of iv) adapted language models. However,
within the de-en subtask, we found that substitut-
ing Length Model and Aligned Pseudo-references
by the features based on Semantic Roles (SEM)
could bring marginally better accuracy. We also
noticed that the learner was sensitive to the fea-
tures used so selecting the appropriate set of fea-
tures was crucial to achieve a good performance.

set-up experiments. Restricting to the evaluation
setting in which ties are not penalized (i.e., cor-
responding to our setting during system and pa-
rameter tuning), we can see that the results corre-
sponding to de-en (Table 5) are comparable to our
set-up results and close to the best performing sys-
tem. However, in the en-es language pair the final
results are comparatively much lower (Table 6).
We find this behavior strange. In this respect, we
analyzed the inter-annotator agreement within the
gold standard. Concretely we computed the Co-
hen?s ? for all overlapping annotations concerning
at least 4 systems for both language pairs. The re-
sults of our analysis are presented in Table 7 and
therefore it confirms our hypothesis that en-es an-
notations had more noise providing an explanation
for the accuracy decrease of our QE models and
setting the subtask into a more challenging sce-
nario. However, further research will be needed to
analyze other factors such as oracles and improve-
ment on automatic metrics prediction and reliabil-
ity compared to linguistic expert annotators.
Another remaining issue for our research con-
cerns investigating better ways to deal with ties,
as their penalization lowered our results dramati-
cally. In this direction we plan to work further on

5 Conclusions
This paper described the TALP-UPC participation
in the WMT?13 Shared Task. We approached the
Quality Estimation task based on system selection,
where different systems have to be ranked accord-
ing to their quality. We derive a full ranking and
identify the best system per sentence on the basis
of Random Forest classifiers.
After the model set-up, we observed consid-
erably good and robust results for both transla-
tion directions, German-to-English and English-
to-Spanish: Kendall?s ? around 0.30 as well as
accuracies around 52% on pairwise classification
and 41% on best translation identification. How-
ever, the results over the official test set were
significantly lower. We have found that the low
inter-annotator agreement between users on that
set might provide an explanation to the poor per-
formance of our QE models.
Our current efforts are centered on explaining
the behavior of our QE models when facing the of-
ficial test sets. We are following two directions: i)
studying the ties? impact to come out with a more
robust model and ii) revise the English-to-Spanish
gold standard annotations in terms of correlation
with automatic metrics to facilitate a deeper un-
derstanding of the results.
