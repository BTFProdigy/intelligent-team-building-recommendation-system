Abstract
We present a supervised learning method
for verbal valency frame detection and se-
lection, i.e., a specific kind of word sense
disambiguation for verbs based on subcat-
egorization information, which amounts
to detecting mentions of events in text.
We use the rich dependency annotation
present in the Prague Dependency Tree-
banks for Czech and English, taking ad-
vantage of several analysis tools (taggers,
parsers) developed on these datasets pre-
viously. The frame selection is based on
manually created lexicons accompanying
these treebanks, namely on PDT-Vallex for
Czech and EngVallex for English. The re-
sults show that verbal predicate detection
is easier for Czech, but in the subsequent
frame selection task, better results have
been achieved for English.
1 Introduction
Valency frames are a detailed semantic and syn-
tactic description of individual predicate senses.
1
As such, they represent different event types. We
present a system for automatic detection and se-
lection of verbal valency frames in Czech and En-
glish, which corresponds to detecting and disam-
biguating mentions of events in text. This is an im-
portant step toward event instance identification,
which should help greatly in linking the mentions
of a single event. We took advantage of the fact
that the Prague family of dependency treebanks
contains comparable valency frame annotation for
Czech and English (cf. Section 2). Thus the fea-
ture templates used in frame selection are the same
1
Valency can be observed for verbs, nouns, adjectives and
in certain theories, also for other parts of speech; however,
we focus on verbal valency only, as it is most common and
sufficiently described in theory and annotated in treebanks.
and the features initially considered differ only in
their instantiation (cf. Section 3).
While somewhat similar to the CoNLL 2009
Shared Task (Haji
?
c et al., 2009) in the predicate
detection part, our task differs from the semantic
role labeling task in that the whole frame has to
be detected, not only individual arguments, and is
therefore more difficult not only in terms of scor-
ing, but also in the selection part: several verbal
frames might share the same syntactic features,
making them virtually indistinguishable unless se-
mantics is taken into account, combined with a de-
tailed grammatical and morphological context.
2 Valency in the tectogrammatical
description
The annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency
Treebank (Bej
?
cek et al., 2012, PDT) and the
Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (Ha-
ji
?
c et al., 2012, PCEDT) is based on the formal
framework of the Functional Generative Descrip-
tion (Sgall, 1967; Sgall et al., 1986, FGD), de-
veloped within the Prague School of Linguistics.
The FGD is dependency-oriented with a ?strati-
ficational? (layered) approach to a systematic de-
scription of a language. The notion of valency in
the FGD is one of the core concepts operating on
the layer of linguistic meaning (tectogrammatical
layer, t-layer).
2.1 Valency frames
The FGD uses syntactic as well as semantic crite-
ria to identify verbal complements. It is assumed
that all semantic verbs ? and, potentially, nouns,
adjectives, and adverbs ? have subcategorization
requirements, which can be specified in the va-
lency frame.
Verbal valency modifications are specified
along two axes: The first axis concerns the (gen-
eral) opposition between inner participants (argu-
ments) and free modifications (adjuncts). This dis-
6
tinction is based on criteria relating to:
(a) the possibility of the same type of comple-
ment appearing multiple times with the same
verb (arguments cannot), and
(b) the possibility of the occurrence of the given
complements (in principle) with any verb
(typical for adjuncts).
The other axis relates to the distinction between
(semantically) obligatory and optional comple-
ments of the word, which again is based on cer-
tain operational criteria expressed as the dialogue
test (Panevov?, 1974). Five arguments are distin-
guished: Actor (ACT), Patient (PAT), Addressee
(ADDR), Origin (ORIG), and Effect (EFF). The
set of free modifications is much larger than that of
arguments; about 50 types of adjuncts are distin-
guished based on semantic criteria. Their set can
be divided into several subclasses: temporal (e.g.,
TWHEN, TSIN), local (e.g., LOC, DIR3), causal
(such as CAUS, CRIT), and other free modifica-
tions (e.g., MANN for general Manner, ACMP for
Accompaniment, EXT for Extent etc.).
All arguments (obligatory or optional) and
obligatory adjuncts are considered to be part of the
valency frame.
2.2 Tectogrammatical annotation
The PDT is a project for FGD-based manual an-
notation of Czech texts, started in 1996 at the In-
stitute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles
University in Prague. It serves two main purposes:
1. to test and validate the FGD linguistic theory,
2. to apply and test machine learning methods for
part-of-speech and morphological tagging, de-
pendency parsing, semantic role labeling, coref-
erence resolution, discourse annotation, natural
language generation, machine translation and
other natural language processing tasks.
The language data in the PDT are non-abbreviated
articles from Czech newspapers and journals.
The PCEDT contains English sentences from
the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Tree-
bank (Marcus et al., 1993, PTB-WSJ) and their
Czech translations, all annotated using the same
theoretical framework as the PDT.
The annotation of the PDT and the PCEDT is
very rich in linguistic information. Following the
stratificational approach of the FGD, the texts are
annotated at different but interlinked layers. There
are four such layers, two linear and two structured:
? the word layer (w-layer) ? tokenized but other-
wise unanalyzed original text,
? the morphological layer (m-layer) with parts-
of-speech, morphology and lemmatization,
? analytical layer (a-layer) ? surface dependency
syntax trees,
? tectogrammatical layer (t-layer) ? ?deep syn-
tax? trees according to the FGD theory.
While the PDT has all the layers annotated man-
ually, the PCEDT English annotation on the a-
layer has been created by automatic conversion
from the original Penn Treebank, including the
usual head assignment; morphology and the tec-
togrammatical layer are annotated manually, even
if not as richly as for Czech.
2
Valency is a core ingredient on the t-layer. Since
valency frames guide, i.a., the labeling of argu-
ments, valency lexicons with sense-distinguished
entries for both languages have been created to en-
sure consistent annotation.
2.3 Valency Lexicons for Czech and English
in the FGD Framework
PDT-Vallex (Haji
?
c et al., 2003; Ure?ov?, 2011) is a
valency lexicon of Czech verbs, nouns, and adjec-
tives, created in a bottom-up way during the an-
notation of the PDT. This approach made it pos-
sible to confront the pre-existing valency theory
with the real usage of the language.
Each entry in the lexicon contains a head-
word, according to which the valency frames are
grouped, indexed, and sorted. Each valency frame
includes the frame?s ?valency? (number of argu-
ments, or frame members) and the following in-
formation for each argument:
? its label (see Section 2.1),
? its (semantic) obligatoriness according to Pane-
vov? (1974)?s dialogue test,
? its required surface form (or several alternative
forms) typically using morphological, lexical
and syntactic constraints.
Most valency frames are further accompanied by a
note or an example which explains their meaning
and usage. The version of PDT-Vallex used here
contains 9,191 valency frames for 5,510 verbs.
EngVallex (Cinkov?, 2006) is a valency lex-
icon of English verbs based on the FGD frame-
work, created by an automatic conversion from
2
Attributes such as tense are annotated automatically, and
most advanced information such as topic and focus annota-
tion is not present.
7
PropBank frame files (Palmer et al., 2005) and by
subsequent manual refinement.
3
EngVallex was
used for the tectogrammatical annotation of the
English part of the PCEDT. Currently, it contains
7,699 valency frames for 4,337 verbs.
3 Automatic frame selection
Building on the modules for Czech and English
automatic tectogrammatical annotation used in the
TectoMT translation engine (?abokrtsk? et al.,
2008) and the CzEng 1.0 corpus (Bojar et al.,
2012),
4
we have implemented a system for au-
tomatic valency frame selection within the Treex
NLP Framework (Popel and ?abokrtsk?, 2010).
The frame selection system is based on logistic
regression from the LibLINEAR package (Fan et
al., 2008). We use separate classification models
for each verbal lemma showing multiple valency
frames in the training data. Due to identical anno-
tation schemata in both languages, our models use
nearly the same feature set,
5
consisting of:
? the surface word form of the lexical verb and all
its auxiliaries,
? their morphological attributes, such as part-of-
speech and grammatical categories,
? formemes ? compact symbolic morphosyn-
tactic labels (e.g., v:fin for a finite verb,
v:because+fin for a finite verb governed
by a subordinating conjunction, v:in+ger for
a gerund governed by a preposition),
6
? syntactic labels given by the dependency parser,
? all of the above properties found in the topolog-
ical and syntactic neighborhood of the verbal
node on the t-layer (parent, children, siblings,
nodes adjacent in the word order).
We experimented with various classifier settings
(regularization type and cost C, termination crite-
rion E) and feature selection techniques (these in-
volve adding a subset of features according to a
metric against the target class).
7
3
This process resulted in the interlinkage of both lexicons,
with additional links to VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) where avail-
able. Due to the refinement, the mapping is often not 1:1.
4
Note that annotation used in TectoMT and CzEng does
not contain all attributes found in corpora manually annotated
on the tectogrammatical layer. Valency frame IDs are an ex-
ample of an attribute that is missing from the automatic an-
notation of CzEng 1.0.
5
The only differences are due to the differences of part-
of-speech tagsets used.
6
See (Du?ek et al., 2012; Rosa et al., 2012) for a detailed
description of formemes.
7
The metrics used include the Anova F-score, minimum
4 Experiments
We evaluated the system described in Section 3
on PDT 2.5 for Czech and on the English part
of PCEDT 2.0 for English. From PCEDT 2.0,
whose division follows the PTB-WSJ, we used
Sections 02-21 as training data, Section 24 as
development data, and Section 23 as evaluation
data. Since the system is intended to be used in
a fully automatic annotation scenario, we use au-
tomatically parsed sentences with projected gold-
standard valency frames to train the classifiers.
The results of our system in the best setting
for both languages are given in Table 1.
8
The
unlabeled figures measure the ability of the sys-
tem to detect that a valency frame should be filled
for a given node. The labeled figures show the
overall system performance, including selecting
the correct frame. The frame selection accuracy
value shows only the percentage of frames se-
lected correctly, disregarding misplaced frames.
The accuracy for ambiguous verbs further disre-
gards frames of lemmas where only one frame is
possible. Here we include a comparison of our
trained classifier with a baseline that always se-
lects the most frequent frame seen in the training
data.
9
Our results using the classifier for both lan-
guages have been confirmed by pairwise bootstrap
resampling (Koehn, 2004) to be significantly bet-
ter than the baseline at 99% level.
We can see that the system is more successful
in Czech in determining whether a valency frame
should be filled for a given node. This is most
probably given by the fact that the most Czech
verbs are easily recognizable by their morphologi-
cal endings, whereas English verbs are more prone
to be misrepresented as nouns or adjectives.
The English system is better at selecting the cor-
rect valency frame. This is probably caused by
a more fine-grained word sense resolution in the
Czech valency lexicon, where more figurative uses
and idioms are included. For example, over 16%
Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR) (Peng et al.,
2005), ReliefF (Kononenko, 1994), mutual information (MI),
symmetric uncertainty (Witten and Frank, 2005, p. 291f.),
and an average of the ranks given by mRMR and MI.
8
The best setting for Czech uses L1-regularization and
10% best features according to Anova, with other parame-
ters tuned on the development set for each lemma. The best
setting for English uses L2-regularization with best feature
subsets tuned on the development set and fixed parameters
C = 0.1, E = 0.01.
9
All other parts of the system, up to the identification of
the frame to be filled in, are identical with the baseline.

Table 1: Experimental results
of errors in the Czech evaluation data were caused
just by idioms or light verb constructions not be-
ing recognized by our system. In Czech, addi-
tional 15% of errors occurred for verbs where two
or more valency frames share the same number of
arguments and their labels, but these verb senses
are considered different (because they have differ-
ent meaning), compared to only 9% in English.
5 Related Work
As mentioned previously, the task of detecting and
selecting valency frames overlaps with semantic
role labeling (Haji
?
c et al., 2009). However, there
are substantial differences: we have focused only
on verbs (as opposed to all words with some se-
mantic relation marked in the data), and evaluated
on the exact frame assigned to the occurrence of
the verb in the treebank. On the other hand, we
are also evaluating predicate identification as in
Surdeanu et al. (2008), which Haji
?
c et al. (2009)
do not. Tagging and parsing have been automatic,
but not performed jointly with the frame selec-
tion task. This also explains that while the best
results reported for the CoNLL 2009 Shared task
(Bj?rkelund et al., 2009) are 85.41% labeled F-1
for Czech and 85.63% for English, they are not
comparable due to several reasons, the main be-
ing that SRL evaluates each argument separately,
while for a frame to be counted as correct in our
task, the whole frame (by means of the refer-
ence ID) must be selected correctly, which is sub-
stantially harder (if only for verbs). Moreover,
we have used the latest version of the PDT (the
PDT 2.5), and EngVallex-annotated verbs in the
PCEDT, while the English CoNLL 2009 Shared
Task is PropBank-based.
10
10
Please recall that EngVallex is a manually refined Prop-
Bank with different labeling scheme and generally m : n
Selecting valency frames is also very similar to
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), see e.g. (Ed-
monds and Cotton, 2001; Chen and Palmer, 2005).
The WSD however does not consider subcatego-
rization/valency information explicitly.
Previous works on the PDT include a rule-based
tool of Honetschl?ger (2003) and experiments by
Semeck? (2007) using machine learning. Both of
them, unlike our work, used gold-standard anno-
tation with just the frame ID removed.
6 Conclusions
We have presented a method of detecting mentions
of events in the form of verbal valency frame se-
lection for Czech and English. This method is
based on logistic regression with morphological
and syntactic features, trained on treebanks with
a comparable annotation scheme. We believe that
these results are first for this task on the granu-
larity of the lexicons (PDT-Vallex for Czech and
EngVallex for English), and they seem to be en-
couraging given that the most frequent verbs like
to be and to have have tens of possible frames,
heavily weighing down the resulting scores.
We plan to extend this work to use additional
features and lexical clustering, as well as to see
if the distinctions in the lexicons are justified, i.e.
if humans can effectively distinguish them in the
first place, similar to the work of Cinkov? et al.
(2012). A natural extension is to combine this
work with argument labeling to match or improve
on the ?perfect proposition? score of Surdeanu et
al. (2008) while still keeping the sense distinctions
on top of it. We could also compare this to other
languages for which similar valency lexicons ex-
ist, such as SALSA for German (Burchardt et al.,
2006) or Chinese PropBank (Xue, 2008).

Abstract
This paper describes in detail the differences between Czech and English annotation us-
ing the Abstract Meaning Representation scheme, which stresses the use of ontologies (and
semantically-oriented verbal lexicons) and relations based on meaning or ontological content
rather than semantics or syntax. The basic ?slogan? of the AMR specification clearly states that
AMR is not an interlingua, yet it is expected that many relations as well as structures constructed
from these relations will be similar or even identical across languages. In our study, we have
investigated 100 sentences in English and their translations into Czech, annotated manually by
AMRs, with the goal to describe the differences and if possible, to classify them into two main
categories: those which are merely convention differences and thus can be unified by changing
such conventions in the AMR annotation guidelines, and those which are so deeply rooted in the
language structure that the level of abstraction which is inherent in the current AMR scheme does
not allow for such unification.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we follow on a previous first exploratory investigation of differences in AMR annotation
among different languages (Xue et al., 2014), which has classified the similarities and differences into
four categories: (a) no difference, (b) local difference only (such as multiword expressions vs. single
word terms), (c) reconcilable difference due to AMR conventions, and (d) deep differences which cannot
be unified in the AMR guidelines. In this paper, we would like to elaborate especially on the (b) and (c)
types, which have been only exemplified in the previous work. In this paper, we would like to not only
go deeper, but also present quantitative comparison on 100 parallel sentences, for all the aforementioned
categories and some of their subtypes.
We will first describe the basic principles of AMR annotation (Banarescu et al., 2013) (Sect. 2, building
also on (Xue et al., 2014)), then present the data (parallel texts) which we have used for this study
(Sect. 3), and describe the quantitative and qualitative comparison between AMR annotation of English
and Czech (Sect. 4). In Sect. 5, we will summarize and discuss further work.
2 Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)
Syntactic treebanks in several languages (Marcus et al., 1993; Haji?c et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2005)
and related annotated corpora such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), Nombank (Meyers et al., 2004),
TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), FactBank (Saur?? and Pustejovsky, 2009), and the Penn Discourse
TreeBank (Prasad et al., 2008), coupled with machine learning techniques, have been used in many NLP
tasks. These annotated resources enabled substantial amounts of research in different areas of semantic
analysis. There had already been tremendous progress in syntactic parsing (Collins, 1999; Charniak,
2000; Petrov and Klein, 2007) and now in Semantic Role Labeling because of the existence of the
PropBank (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Bohnet et al., 2013)

and similar resources in other languages (Haji?c et al., 2009), and TimeBank has fueled much research in
the area of temporal analysis.
There have been efforts to create a unified representation which would cover at least a whole sentence,
or even a continuous text (Haji?c et al., 2003; Srikumar and Roth, 2013), and currently the Abstract
Meaning Representation represents an attempt to provide a common ground for truly semantic and fully
covering annotation representation.
An Abstract Meaning Representation is a rooted, directional and labeled graph that represents the
meaning of a sentence and it abstracts away from such syntactic notions as word category (verbs and
nouns), word order, morphological variation etc. Instead, it focuses on semantic relations between con-
cepts and makes heavy use of predicate-argument structures as defined in PropBank (for English). As
a result, the word order in the sentence is considered to be of little relevance to the meaning represen-
tation and is not necessarily maintained in the AMR. In addition, many function words (determiners,
prepositions) that do not contribute to meaning and are not explicitly represented in AMR, except for the
semantic relations they express. Readers are referred to Baranescu et al. (2013) for a complete descrip-
tion of AMR.

Figure 1: AMR annotation of the sentence ?This infatuation with city living truly baffles me.?
An example of an AMR-annotated sentence can be seen in Fig. 1. The predicate of the sentence
(baffle) becomes the root of the annotation graph, with a reference to the correct sense baffle-01 as
found in PropBank frame files for baffle; PropBank frame files play the role of an ontology of events.
Arguments of predicates, again as described in the PropBank frames, become the substitutes for roles of
the ?who did what to whom? interpretation - in the example sentence, infatuation - marked as ARG0 - is
the thing that baffles someone (the ARG1), i.e. me (the author of the text) in this case. This ?baffling? is
further modified by ?truly?, and marked simply as a modifier, the semantics of which is fully represented
by the word true itself. The agent (infatuation) has to be further restricted - it is the ?infatuation with
city living? which baffles the author - not just any infatuation. This is represented by the relation topic
assigned to the edge between infatuation and live-01 in the AMR graph, and the ?living? (sense
live-01) is further restricted by the location mentioned in the sentence, namely city. Finally,
the modifier this is kept in, since it is needed for reference to previous text, where the ?infatuation?
has been first mentioned.
While the graphical representation in Fig. 1 is simplified in that it does not show the AMR?s crucial
instance-of relations explicitly as edges in the AMR graph, Fig. 2 shows the native underlying
?bracketed? textual representation of the same tree, where the main nodes (i.e. those shown visibly in
Fig. 1) are mentions, and the labels baffle-01, true, live-01, city etc. represent links to
external ontologies. These links are currently represented only by these strings, or by links to PropBank

This paragraph as well as the two preceding ones are taken over (and slightly adapted) from the introductory sections of a
previous paper on this topic presented at LREC and co-authored by us (Xue et al., 2014); we share the same AMR formalism

files for events. In the future, these links will be wikified, i.e. for concepts described in an external
ontology, such as Wikipedia, they will be linked to it. The single- or two-letter ?indexes? are in fact the
labels (IDs) of the mentions, and they also serve for (co-)reference purposes; the slash (?/?) is a shortcut
for the instance-of relation.

Figure 2: Textual form of the AMR annotation of the sentence ?This infatuation with city living truly
baffles me.?
In Czech, the event ontology has been approximated by the Czech valency dictionary, PDT-Vallex
(Haji?c et al., 2003), (Ure?sov?a, 2009), (Ure?sov?a and Pajas, 2009), (Ure?sov?a, 2006). No wikification of
non-event nodes has been attempted yet; this is a continuing work, as it is for English.
3 The Data
We have drawn on a blog on Virginia road construction, taken from the WB part of the Penn Treebank.
These sentences have already been annotated using AMRs, and also translated to Czech
2
and subse-
quently AMR-annotated. The English text has 1676 word and punctuation tokens (using the Penn Tree-
bank style tokenization), and its annotated AMR representation contains 1231 nodes (not counting the
instance-of nodes as separate nodes). The Czech version is a result of manually doubly-translated
English original, which has been mutually checked and then one (slightly corrected) translation has been
used for annotation. The Czech text has a total of 1563 tokens and its AMR representation contains 1215
nodes (again, not counting the instance-of nodes as separate nodes).
The data, once annotated, have been converted to a graph and in such a form presented to a linguist
familiar with the AMR style annotation, to study and extract statistics for this comparison study. Fig. 3
shows such a side-by-side graphs for English and Czech AMR for the example parallel sentences.
4 The Comparison
4.1 Quantitative Comparison
In the first pass, we have concentrated on marking and counting the following phenomena:
? structural identity: sentences with identical structure have been marked as being structurally the
same, even if some relation (edge) labels have been different
? structural differences: no. of structural differences have been noted in cases where one or more
(sub)parts of the AMR graph differ between the two languages
? local difference only: out of the above, certain differences have been marked as ?local only? - for
example, if a multiword expression annotated as several nodes in one language corresponds to a
single node in the other language
? relation differences: for each sentence, number of differences in relational labels has been counted
? reference differences: number of different references to an external ontology (or assumed differ-
ences in case no link to such an ontology was actually present in the annotation).
2
...and Chinese, but that was not used for this study.
57
Figure 3: AMR annotation of the sentence ?This infatuation with city living truly baffles me.? and its
translation to Czech (?Tohle/this poblouzn?en??/infatuation bydlen??m/living-INSTR v/in m?estsk?em/city-like
stylu/style m?e/me po?r?ad/still mate/baffles.?)
It is obvious that we could have observed also other types of differences, but at this point, we wanted
to have at least an idea how many differences exist in our approx. 1500-token sample. The resulting
figures are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Number and percentages of differences in the annotated data
The number of truly identically annotated sentences (including relation labeling) was only four, two
of which has been interjective ?sentences? at the beginning of the document (?Braaawk!?). On the other
hand, 18 additional sentences would be structurally identical (on top of the 29) if local differences were
disregarded, bringing the (unlabeled sentence identity) total to 47, or almost half of the data (47=29+18).
4.2 Analysis of Differences
The main goal of this study is to analyze differences in the annotation for the two languages, Czech
and English, and determine if a reconciliation of the annotation is possible or not (and for what reason
it is / it is not). Based on the above quantitative analysis, we have concentrated on relation labeling
differences due their high proportion, and on structural differences due to their heterogeneous nature.
The differences in reference annotation are small, but this is due to the lack of full referential annotation
(it has been done for events, but only assumed for other types of entities due to the lack of ontology,
or better to say due to the lack of ?wikification? annotation in both languages), rather than due to high
agreement. We will come back to this once wikification of the annotation is finished.
3
Structural differences are hard to quantify exactly, since the base is difficult to define; it is part of future work.
58
4.3 Differences in Relation Labeling
The differences in function labeling should be taken with a grain of salt. The crucial question is what
should count as a difference in relation labeling if the structure differs - should this be automatically
counted as a difference, or not at all? In the figures summarized in Table 1, we have taken a middle
ground: if the structural difference implied a change in labeling by itself, we have not counted that
difference in order not to ?penalize? the sentence annotation twice.
More detailed inspection of relation labeling differences, which appear to be relatively frequent at
more than 1/4th of all nodes in the annotation, revealed that the by far most frequent mismatch is caused
by different argument labeling for events.
4
While for most purely transitive verbs there is a complete
match, for most other there is a discrepancy due to the attempted semanticization of PDT-Vallex argu-
ment labels ADDR (addressee), EFF (effect) and ORIG (origin), while PropBank simply continues to
number arguments of corresponding verbs consecutively (for example, I thought there is.ARG1 ... vs.
Myslel/I-thought jsem, ?ze/that tam/there je.ARG3?EFF/is ...). The concept of ?shifting? in PDT-Vallex,
which compulsorily fills the first two arguments on syntactic grounds as ACT(ARG0) and PAT(ARG1)
is another source of differences. Furthermore, PropBank leaves out ARG0 e.g. for unaccusative verbs
(for example The window.ARG1 broke vs. Okno.ARG0?ACT/window se/itself rozbilo/broke.). Finally,
some differences are due to some arguments not being considered arguments at all in the other language,
in which case some other AMR label is used instead (for example, We could have spent 400M.ARG3 ...
elsewhere vs. ... mohli/could utratit/spend 400M.extent ... jinde/elsewhere).
These differences could possibly be consolidated (only) by carefully linking the two lexicons (with
AMR guidelines intact). This is in fact being performed in another project (Sindlerova et al., 2014), but
it is a daunting manual task, since the underlying theories behind PropBank and PDT-Vallex/EngVallex
differ. However, one has to ask if it does make sense to do so, because with enough parallel data available,
the mappings can be learned relatively easily: in most cases, no structural differences are involved and
there will be a simple one-to-one mapping between the labels (conditioned on the particular verb sense).
4.4 Structural Differences
Local differences can be safely ignored, since they will be in most cases resolved during the assumed
process of wikification, i.e., linking to an ontology concept. For example, the abbreviation VDOT (Vir-
ginia Department of Transportation), which has to be (and was) translated into Czech in an explanatory
way (otherwise the sentence would become not quite understandable, if only because of the real-world
context). Without wikification, it could not be linked as a whole, and thus a subgraph has been created
with the AMR-appropriate internal semantic relations in the translation (e.g. Virginia.location, etc.).
Certain differences, albeit ?localized? into a small subtree (or subgraph) corresponding to a single
node or another small subtree (subgraph), cannot be resolved by wikification of a different event ontology
(than PropBank or PDT-Vallex). For example, light verb constructions or even certain modal or aspectual
constructions could have a single verb equivalent resulting in two node vs. single node annotation: get
close vs. p?ribl???zit-se, make worse vs. zhor?sit, take position (for sb) vs. zast?avat-se or causing sprawl vs.
roztahuje-se.
Looking at the true structural differences, we have found that there are actually quite a few reasons for
them to appear in the annotation. We will describe them in more detail below.
Non-literal translation is the primary reason for such differences.
5
For example, destination vs.
kam/where-to lid?e/people jezd??/drive (Fig. 4), or job center vs. m??sto/place, kde/where pracuje/work
hodn?e/many lid??/people; these cases cannot be unified neither by changing the translation to a more literal
one (because it would be strongly misleading in the given context, despite the fact that literal translation
of both destination as well as job center does exist in Czech), neither by changing the guidelines, since
the level of abstraction of AMR does not call for a unification of such concepts. Sometimes, non-literal
4
The Czech PDT-Vallex argument labels have been mapped to PropBank labels as follows: ACT? ARG0, PAT? ARG1,
ADDR? ARG2, EFF? ARG3 and ORIG? ARG4.
5
This includes also cases of truly wrong translation, stemming of translator?s misunderstanding of the facts behind the
sentence. This has been found fairly often only after we studied the differences in depth, since a superficial reading and
standard translation revision procedure did not help.
59
translation is forced upon the translation because no word-for-word translation exists, such as in in the
aggregate, which has to be translated using an extra clause z/from celkov?eho/overall pohledu/view to/it
je/is tak/so, ?ze/that ... (Fig. 5).
Figure 4: AMR structural difference: destination vs. kam/where-to lid?e/people jezd??/drive
Phraseological differences and idioms form another large group of differences between the two lan-
guages. The possibility of changing the translation is even more remote than in the above case, even if we
had the chance: the provided translation is actually the correct and perfect one. The reason for different
annotation lies in the AMR scheme, which does not go that far to require ?unified? annotation in such
cases where the idiom or specific phrase cannot be linked to the external ontology as a single unit. For
example, English ?I don?t see any point? is translated as ?nem?a/not-have smysl/purpose?, and despite the
fact that have-purpose-91 is a specific event reference in English (and has been used in the anno-
tation), the verb ?see? still remains annotated as a separate event node, which is not the case in Czech,
since no ?seeing? is expressed in the sentence and it could hardly be asked for in the guidelines to be
inserted. Similarly, I commute back and forth has been translated simply as doj???zd??m/commute, which is
semantically perfectly equivalent but the back and forth has been kept in the English annotation, because
60
Figure 5: AMR structural difference: in the aggregate vs. z/from celkov?eho/overall pohledu/view to/it
je/is tak/so, ?ze/that ...
deleting it was (probably) considered loss of information. It is only the confrontation with the translation
to a different language when one realizes that with just a little more abstraction, the annotation could
have been structurally the same (by keeping only the commute node in in the English annotation).
6
Translation by interpretation is typically discouraged in translation school education, but sometimes
it is necessary to use it for smooth understanding of the translated text. Often, such interpretation results
in different AMR annotation. For example, Virginia centrist has been translated as st?redov?y/centrist
voli?c/voter [z/from Virginie/Virginia], because without the extra word voli?c, the literal translation of
centrist would not be understandable correctly in this context (Fig. 6). Similarly, a 55mph zone vs.
z?ona/zone s/with omezen??m/restriction na/to 55 mph (added word omezen??m/restriction), or traffic vs.
dopravn??/traffic z?acpa/jam.
Convention differences are inherent in many annotation schemes, and we have found them in AMR
6
One could perhaps also argue that adding the equivalent of back and forth to the Czech translation would unify the trans-
lation, too; however, adding its literal equivalent in Czech tam a zp?et would be considered superfluous and unnatural by Czech
speakers.
61
Figure 6: AMR structural difference: Virginia Centrist vs.
st?redov?y/centrist voli?c/voter [z/from Virginie/Virginia]
Figure 7: AMR convention difference:
auditor as a single node vs. person, who
audits
guidelines, too. Often, they were related to the use of ARG-of vs. keeping the nominalization as a
single node. For example, for auditor, translated quite literally as auditor into Czech, has been annotated
as ?a person, who audits? in English while in the Czech AMR structure, there is a single node (Fig. 7)
labeled as auditor (which undoubtedly will be correctly linked to some ontology entry after such link-
age/wikification is complete). These differences might be harder to consolidate, since such conventions
are very difficult to create proper guidelines for, especially across languages. No ontology (whether for
events or objects) will be complete either (to base the decisions on a particular ontology content).
5 Conclusions and Future Work
We have investigated differences in the annotation of parallel texts using the Abstract Meaning Rep-
resentation scheme, on approx. 1500 words of English-Czech corpus (100 sentences). We found and
counted the number of identities and four types of differences (structural, structural local, relational, and
referential), and exemplified them to see if a reconciliation (either by possibly changing the translation,
the guidelines, or the annotation itself) is possible.
This is a work in progress. Substantial amount of work remains. We will have to use larger data,
multiple annotation (interannotator agreement on English was relatively low and we expect to be the
case on Czech, too, once two annotators start annotating the same sentences), and we would also have
to actually suggest changes in the guidelines or their conventions, and to test them also on substantial
amounts of data.
The immediate extension of this work will cover wikification, i.e. the linking of all nodes in the AMR
representation of our dataset to some ontology: events are already covered, internally defined relations
are already annotated, too (such as named entity types, dates, quantities, etc.), but external links remain to
be added. We will not only use Wikipedia (as the term ?wikification? might suggest), but we will extend
this idea also to other sources, such as DBpedia or BabelNet, keeping all links in parallel if possible.
This should allow for deep comparison of the two languages also content-wise. We should then be able
to better answer the question of annotation unification which does depend on these links rather than on
the annotation guidelines themselves.
Parallel AMR-annotated data will be used at the JHU 2014 Summer Workshop, where technology for
AMR-based parsing, generation and possibly also MT will be developed, allowing also technological
insight into the AMR scheme across languages.
