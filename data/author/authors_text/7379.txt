Abstract
The title of a document has two roles, to give
a compact summary and to lead the reader to
read the document. Conventional title gener-
ation focuses on finding key expressions from
the author?s wording in the document to give
a compact summary and pays little attention
to the reader?s interest. To make the title play
its second role properly, it is indispensable to
clarify the content (?what to say?) and word-
ing (?how to say?) of titles that are effective to
attract the target reader?s interest. In this arti-
cle, we first identify typical content and wording
of titles aimed at general readers in a compar-
ative study between titles of technical papers
and headlines rewritten for newspapers. Next,
we describe the results of a questionnaire sur-
vey on the effects of the content and wording
of titles on the reader?s interest. The survey of
general and knowledgeable readers shows both
common and different tendencies in interest.
1 Introduction
The title is expected to play two roles. One is to
give the reader a very compact summary of the
document, and the other is to attract the target
reader?s interest and lead the reader to read the
document. It is preferable that a title plays both
roles, because the reader may be disappointed
with a gap between the title and the document
if the title plays the former role poorly, and the
reader may not read the document if the title
plays the latter role poorly. Therefore, it is very
important what title is attached to a document.
Several techniques have been reported
on generating titles (Jin and Hauptmann,
2000)(Berger and Mittal, 2000), and they focus
on the former role, that is, to give a compact
summary. The main approach is to find a few
keywords from the document by calculating
the importance of each word in the document.
This approach, incidentally, is similar to most
text summarization techniques. The selected
keywords or title strongly reflect the author?s
wordings. In other words, this approach is an
?author-centered approach?. In some cases, the
title generated by this approach might play the
latter role poorly and fail to get the reader?s
interest.
To make generated titles play their latter role
properly, it is not sufficient to look into only
the author?s document. It is important to also
pay more attention to the reader. It is neces-
sary in the ?reader-centered approach? to clar-
ify the features of the reader?s attention, that
is, the relationship between the reader?s atten-
tion and the content and wording of the title.
Based on this knowledge, it will be possible to
extract information from the document that is
more attractive to the reader than the author?s
key expressions and to include it in the gener-
ated title.
Our first goal is to clarify the kind of content
and wording that are key to getting the reader?s
comprehension, interest in, and positive feel-
ing toward the document. For this purpose, we
first conducted a comparative study on the ti-
tles of technical papers and headlines rewritten
for newspapers to identify the typical content
and wording of titles aimed at general readers.
We then conducted a questionnaire survey on
the effects of different content and wording of
titles on different kinds of readers? interest.
The following sections are as follows: section
2 describes the comparative study and its re-
sults, section 3 and 4 explain the details and
the results of our questionnaire survey, and sec-
tion 5 relates our conclusion and future work.
2 Comparison between Paper Titles
and Newspaper Headlines
To identify the typical content and wording of
titles aimed at general readers, we conducted
a comparative study on the Japanese titles of
research papers and the headlines of Japanese
newspaper articles describing the corresponding
technology.
We first divided the titles and headlines into
several syntactic components (text segments)
and assigned each component a syntactic func-
tion tag, such as ?P(urpose of development)?
and ?M(ethod for realization)?, and then com-
paratively analyzed the expression of paper title
and headlines on the basis of each component.
2.1 Overview of Collected Documents
Table 1 shows the outlines of collected docu-
ments, including research papers (articles and
technical reports) and newspaper articles (from
three trade newspapers and one general newspa-
per). The Japanese titles and headlines were re-
trieved from a document database at a research
institute. They cover science and technology at
large.
We identified one or a few technical papers
closely related to about 90% of the headlines.
2.2 Syntactic Function Tags
We found that most text segments of the col-
lected titles and headlines could be classified
into the following syntactic function tags. Here,
we define each syntactic function tag and de-
scribe the tagging process we used in the anal-
ysis.
 B(ehavior): Behavior is expressed by a ver-
bal noun or verb. For example, in the title
?Development of an Exploration System of
Buried Cables?, the word ?exploration? de-
scribes the main behavior or action of the
developed technology and is assigned the tag
?B?.
 O(bject): The object is a noun phrase in the
objective case of the verbal noun of behav-
ior ?B?. In the above example, the compound
noun ?buried cables? is assigned the tag ?O?.
 T(echnology type): The words assigned the
tag ?T?(echnology type) are very restricted
and include such words as ?system?, ?model?
and ?method?. They express the form of the
developed technology.
 P(urpose): The purpose of development is
usually expressed by a noun phrase following
a preposition, such as ?for? (?no tame-ni/no?
in Japanese). (e.g., ?for power distribution
cables under pavements?)
 M(ethod): The tag ?M? stands for the
method for realization and is expressed by a
noun phrase following a preposition, such as
?by? (?ni yori? in Japanese). (e.g., ?by un-
derground radar?)
 S(trong point): ?S? stands for the advantage
or merit of the developed technology. It is
usually expressed by an adjective or adverb
phrase. (e.g., ?highly accurate?).
 D(evelopment): ?D? stands for the expres-
sion that frequently appears in paper titles
and headlines, such as ?the development of?,
?the evaluation of?, and ?a study on?.
 E(t alia): There are several text segments
that do not fall into the above seven cat-
egories. They appear mainly in newspaper
headlines. Two examples are names of devel-
opment organizations and descriptions of the
issue for practical use of the technology.
We excluded the two tags ?D? and ?E? in a
comparative analysis because they do not di-
rectly relate to the content of the developed
technology.
2.3 Tagging Process
As for paper titles (in Japanese), we divided
them semiautomatically according to the follow-
ing pattern
P? M? S? O S? B S? T? D?
(Each alphabet means syntactic function tag.
??? means ?either zero times or one time?.)
using the ?ChaSen? Japanese morphological an-
alyzer (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000) and syn-
tactic clues (such as word order, syntactic cate-
gory and specific prepositions). The results are
reviewed and errors are manually corrected.
As for headlines, automatic tagging is difficult
because of the frequent use of verbal omissions
and inversion. Therefore, we manually divided
the headlines. In order to improve the preci-
sion of human tagging as highly as possible, the
human tagger divided them according to the fol-
lowing procedure.

2. Determine the verb (or verbal noun) which
corresponds to ?B? using syntactic and se-
mantic clues (such as special prepositions and
semantic modification relations).
3. Identify the other components which modify
?B? using the clues used in the above step 2.
2.4 Comparative Analysis
We analyzed the results of the above tagging in
the following two ways.
1. The difference in the frequency of the six main
components with tag B(ehavior), O(bject),
M(ethod), S(trong point), P(urpose) and
T(echnology type) in paper titles and head-
lines.
2. The difference in the expression of the same
syntactic components in paper titles and
headlines.
2.5 Obligatory and Optional
Components
The last column in Table 2 indicates the fre-
quency of the occurrence of each tag in titles
and headlines. The components (text segments)
with tags ?B? , ?O?, and ?T? appear more than
80%, 80%, and 58%, respectively, in titles and
headlines 1 . We call these high-frequency com-
ponents ?obligatory component? and the other
components with ?P?, ?M?, and ?S?, ?optional
components? .
2.5.1 Obligatory Components
Obligatory components are important because
they are essential in reporting the substance of
the technology to the reader.
By comparing the expression of the obligatory
components (labeled ?T?, ?B?, and ?O?), we
categorized the difference of the expression into
two points. One is that technical jargons are
used in paper titles while plain terms are used
in headlines to express the same thing. The
other is that in the obligatory component the
title explains the concrete content of the tech-
1?B? and ?O? appear 100% in the paper titles and
80% in the headlines because verbal omissions sometimes
occur in newspaper headlines.
nology while the headline expresses the purpose
of the technology, which general readers can un-
derstand.
In other words, we identified two expressing
techniques of newspapermen.
 Instead of using technical jargons, the plain
synonymous terms are used.
 Instead of expressing what the technology
does, they express what the purpose of the
technology is.
An example of the former in English is as fol-
lows:
Title: Method to Shorten Radioactive Half-life
Headline: Method to Shorten the Duration of Ra-
diation
An example of the latter is as follows:
Title: Method to Shorten Radioactive Half-life
Headline: Method to Shorten Storage Period of
Radioactive Waste
The expression patterns typical in obligatory
components are summarized in Table 3. It is
arranged from the two viewpoints of ?what to
say? and ?how to say?.
2.5.2 Optional Components
By comparing the expression of the optional
components, in the ?M? component we found
that technical jargons are frequently used in pa-
per titles while plain terms are used in head-
lines. Moreover, by analyzing the frequency
of component combinations, we found that the
combination of optional components with ?M?
and ?S? is seldom used in any title or headline.
We also found that the use of ?M? in titles is
more frequent than in headlines while the de-
scription of the advantages (?S?) in headlines
is five times more frequent than in titles. The
analysis suggests that the description of ?M?
found in paper titles are omitted in headlines
and the description of advantages (?S?) are used
in headlines.
The expressing techniques we identified are as
follows:
 Instead of using technical jargons, the plain
synonymous terms are used in the ?M? com-
ponent.
 Instead of expressing the method of realizing
the technology, they express the advantage
(?S?) of the technology.
An example of the former in English is as fol-
lows.
Title: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Ra-
dioactive Waste by Metallic Fuel FBR
Headline: Method to Shorten Storage Period of
Radioactive Waste by Burnout
An example of the latter is as follows:
Title: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Ra-
dioactive Waste by Metallic Fuel FBR
Headline: Method to Shorten Storage Period of
Radioactive Waste by 1/10000
The expression patterns typical in optional
components are summarized in Table 4. The
table is also arranged from the two viewpoints
of ?what to say? and ?how to say?, as in Table
3.
3 Questionnaire Survey
In this section, we explain the details of our
questionnaire survey.
3.1 Viewpoint of the Survey
We assume that the factors which affect the
reader?s impression of a title which expresses
newly developed technology are the following:
F1 Mode of expression for titles (in other
word, the expression patterns)
F2 Whether or not the reader has an interest
in the technical field
F3 The reader?s level of expertise in the tech-
nical field
Therefore, in order to clarify what kind of
impression the title based on each expression
pattern (F1) gives the reader, we should inves-
tigate how the impressions that each reader who
differs in F2 and F3 receives change with each
expression pattern. We then prepared our ques-
tionnaire survey according to the following pro-
cedures.
1. Select the technical fields for the survey (we
selected three fields: electric transmission,
architectural engineering, and environmental
science).
2. Categorize the respondents by their interest
in each technical field and their expertise in
that field.
3. Generate titles describing new technologies in
the three technical fields by using expression
patterns

4. Draw up a questionnaire which asks the re-
spondents what kind of impression they had
when they read each generated title.
In the following three subsections, we explain
the details of the above procedures step 2, 3 and
4, in order.
3.2 Categorization of Respondents
In order to categorize the respondents by their
interest in each technical field and their exper-
tise of that field, we asked the respondents two
questions in the preliminary questionnaire.
One asked them if they were con-
cerned/unconcerned with one of the three
technical fields, and the other asked them
about their main source of information (three
options: general newspaper, trade newspaper,
and academic journal, were given, if they were
concerned).
We categorized them into two types (?Un-
concerned? and ?Concerned?) by the former
question. We then categorized ?Concerned?
into three types (?Commoner?, ?Engineer? and
?Researcher?, whose main sources of informa-
tion are general newspaper, trade newspaper
and academic journal in turn.) by the lat-
ter question. We labeled ?Unconcerned? and
three types of ?Concerned? (?Commoner?, ?En-
gineer? and ?Researcher?) as readership. Table
5 shows the number of respondents by reader-
ship.
3.3 Titles Prepared for Our
Questionnaire
In this section, we explain the method for com-
posing the titles used in the questionnaire. The
procedure for composing the titles follows.
1. Select three new technologies in each of the
three technical fields, which were developed
in a research institute.
2. Retrieve the phrases of titles and headlines
concerning each technology, from the docu-
ment database of the institute, that corre-
spond to each expression pattern.
3. Combine the phrases to compose twelve ti-
tles per each technology, using three types of
obligatory component expression pattern of
by four types of optional component expres-
sion pattern (including a pattern without op-
tional components). The total number of the
titles per one field is 36 (twelve titles by three
fields).
Table 5: Number of Respondents
Unconcerned Concerned
Commoner Engineer Researcher
Electric Transmission 151 114 69 48
Architectural Engineering 168 115 62 45
Environmental Science 108 153 71 53
We divided thirty six titles per each field into
four groups (each group consists of nine titles).
The breakdown of the nine titles is three types
of obligatory component expression pattern by
three types of optional component expression
pattern. We randomly divided the respondents
of each readership into four groups and then
asked four groups of the respondents about the
impression of four groups of the titles respec-
tively.
3.4 Contents of Our Questionnaire
In order to investigate whether each prepared ti-
tle is effective in getting each readership?s com-
prehension, positive feelings, and interest, we
asked the respondents the following questions
in turn.
 Do you think the title is comprehensible?
 Do you feel positive toward the technology
after reading this?
 Do you want to know more about the tech-
nology?
3.5 Method
Respondents to the questionnaire were the staff
of a research institute and monitors of a market-
ing research firm. We asked them to answer our
questionnaire on a Web page which is prepared
for this survey.
4 Difference in Impression
According to Obligatory
Component Expression Pattern
In this section, we report on the analysis of
the correlation between the obligatory compo-
nent expression pattern in titles and each read-
ership?s impression of the titles.
Figure 1 shows the graph of the percentage of
titles regarded as ?comprehensible? by the re-
spondents with each readership using each ex-
pression pattern. Figure 2 and 3 also show the
ones regarded as ?evoked positive feelings?, ?in-
teresting? respectively. We also made a 3x2

each readership and calculated the significance
level of the ?2-test and the Cramer?s V 2.
Because all significance levels in Table 6 are
under 5%, it is confirmed that there exists asso-
ciations among expression patterns and impres-
sions for each readership.
However, the strength of the associations is
low as for the respondents with readership ?en-
gineer? or ?researcher?, who have expertise, be-
cause of lower values of Cramer?s V, while the
strength of the association is high as for those
who has readership ?unconcerned? or ?com-
moner? because of higher values of V.
Because all graphs slope up from left to right
in Figures 1, 2 and 3, the expression pattern
2.0 (expressing what the purpose of the tech-
nology is) is the most effective to make a title
impressive (more precisely, regarded as ?com-
prehensible?, ?evoked positive feelings? and ?in-
teresting?) for readers with most of readership,
especially the ?unconcerned? readers or ?com-
moner?. As for the readers with expertise, other
types of expression patterns such as 1.1 or 1.2
should also be considered because of their flatter
slopes.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We emphasized the need for title generation
centered on the reader and identified the typical
content and wording of titles aimed at general
readers by conducting a comparative study on
paper titles and headlines. Moreover, we ver-

whichever is smaller. Cramer?s V ranges 0 to 1 where

lated and 1 means that they are perfectly related.
ified the effects of different content and word-
ing of titles. As a result, titles using expres-
sion pattern 2.0 (expressing what the purpose
of the technology is) in obligatory component is
the most effective in getting the general reader?s
comprehension, positive feelings, and interest.
However, the more expertise in a technical field
the reader has, the less the reader tends to be
influenced.
In future work, we will verify the difference
in impression according to optional component
expression patterns by analyzing the results of
our questionnaire survey. We plan to establish
the method for generating a title by extract-
ing phrases from the body text and combining
them, which correspond to the expression pat-
tern which is effective in getting target reader?s
interest.

Abstract
When we write a report or an explanation
on a newly-developed technology for readers
including laypersons, it is very important to
compose a title that can stimulate their in-
terest in the technology. However, it is dif-
ficult for inexperienced authors to come up
with an appealing title.
In this research, we developed a support sys-
tem for revising titles. We call it ?title revi-
sion wizard?. The wizard provides a guid-
ance on revising draft title to compose a title
meeting three key points, and support tools
for coming up with and elaborating on com-
prehensible or appealing phrases.
In order to test the effect of our title revision
wizard, we conducted a questionnaire sur-
vey on the effect of the titles with or with-
out using the wizard on the interest of lay
readers. The survey showed that the wiz-
ard is effective and helpful for the authors
who cannot compose appealing titles for lay
readers by themselves.
1 Introduction
When we read a document, we usually read its
title first, and then we read the body text only
if the title catches our interest. Therefore, when
we write a report or an explanation on a newly-
developed technology intended for readers in-
cluding laypersons, it is very important to com-
pose a title that will stimulate their interest in
the technology. However, technical specialists
are not necessarily good at composing appeal-
ing titles, because it isn?t clear what sort of titles
will stimulate the interest of lay readers in the
technology.
In the field of NLP and linguistics, there are
few researches which help the specialists com-
pose appealing titles for lay readers. Several
researches have been reported on title genera-
tion (Jin and Hauptmann, 2000) (Berger and
Mittal, 2000) and readability of texts (Minel et
al., 1997) (Hartley and Sydes, 1997) (Inui et al,
2003). However, the researches on title gener-
ation focus on generating a very compact sum-
mary of the document rather than composing
an appealing title. The previous researches on
readability mainly see it as comprehensibility
rather than interestingness.
In this regard, our previous study (Senda and
Sinohara, 2002) clarified what sort of content
and wording in titles are effective in stimulat-
ing lay readers? interest in the technology by an
analysis of a parallel corpus of Japanese techni-
cal paper titles and Japanese newspapers head-
lines. The study categorized the effective con-
tent and wording of the titles into the following
three key points.
Key Point 1 (for Wording) Instead of tech-
nical terms, use synonymous plain terms
even where the plain term is not synony-
mous with the technical term in a precise
sense.
Key Point 2 (for Content) Describe what
the technology is for, rather than what
the technology does.
Key Point 3 (for Content) Describe the ad-
vantages of the technology, rather than
the method of realizing the technology.
Our next goal is to enable inexperienced au-
thors to compose a title according to these key
points. To this end, we developed a support
system for revising titles. We call it ?title revi-
sion wizard?. The wizard provides a guidance
on revising draft title to compose a title meet-
ing the key points, and a few support tools for
coming up with and elaborating on appealing
phrases. In this paper, we report on the title
revision wizard, and a questionnaire survey on
the effect of titles composed with and without
using the wizard on the interest of lay readers.
2 Method for Revising Titles

Figure 1: Steps in the Procedure for Revising draft title Using the Wizard
up with appealing titles for lay readers even
when they know the three key points.
In our title revision wizard, therefore, the au-
thors first input draft title into the title tem-
plate, and then compose candidates of title by
revising the phrases of the draft title according
to the wizard?s guidance with the help of the
support tools provided.
The steps in the wizard?s procedure are il-
lustrated in Figure 1 1 . In the following, we
explain the steps with reference to Figure 1.
2.1 Inputting Some Phrases into the
Title Template
In step 1, the user inputs draft title into the
title template displayed in the wizard window.
The title template consists of an ?OBligatory
Part? (OB-P) and an ?OPtional Part? (OP-P).
The OB-P phrase describes what the technology
does, and OP-P phrase describes the method
used to implement the technology or the advan-
tages of the technology.
2.2 Revising the Obligatory Phrases
In step 2, the wizard presents only OB-P to the
user, and hides OP-P. The user revises only the
OB-P phrase according to the two key points.
First, the user changes technical terms to the
synonymous plain terms according to key point
1The sample titles presented in Figure 1 are trans-
lated into English from original Japanese titles.
1. In the template 2-1 in step 2, the technical
term ?the Radioactive Half-life? is changed to
the plainer term ?the Duration of Radiation?
from this viewpoint.
Secondly, the user changes the phrase in the
OB-P slots to describe the purpose of the tech-
nology rather than what the technology does,
according to key point 2. In the template 2-2
in step 2, the phrase ?Shorten the Radioactive
Half-life? is changed to the phrase ?Shorten the
Storage Period of Radioactive Waste? from this
view point.
These revised OB-P phrases without optional
phrase are recorded as candidates of ?simple?
title for future selection in step 4. At the end
of step 2, for future revision in step 3, the user
selects one title that he/she deems the better
one from these candidates of title.
2.3 Revising the Optional Phrases
In step 3, the wizard presents new title combin-
ing OB-P phrase (selected at the end of step 2)
and the OP-P phrase (inputted in step 1) as a
draft title. The user revises only the OP-P draft
phrase according to the two key points.
First, the user changes technical terms to syn-
onymous plain terms according to key point 1.
In the template 3-1 in step 3, the technical term
?Metallic Fuel FBR? in the slot is changed to
the plainer term ?Burnout? from this viewpoint.
Secondly, the user changes the phrase in the
slot to describe the advantages of the technology
rather than the method of realizing the technol-
ogy according to key point 3. In the template
3-2 in step 3, the OP-P phrase is changed to the
phrase ?by 1/10000? from this viewpoint.
The title combining the title selected in step
2 and each phrase revised at step 3 are recorded
as candidates of title for future selection in step
4. Before next step, the user can return to step
2 to select another OB-P phrase and revise OP-
P phrase attached to the OB-P phrase in step
3 again if he/she likes.
2.4 Select the Title from Title
Candidates
In step 4, the user selects one title from the
candidates of title composed in the above steps.
2.5 An Example of the Wizard Window
Figure 2 is a screenshot of the Wizard. This
screenshot shows the window in step 2 described
in section 2.2. The Japanese text in upper pane
of the window is the explanation of key point
1. The template for the OB-P Phrase for key
point 1 is displayed at the bottom of the win-
dow. The buttons in the center of the pane are
for accessing the support tools for coming up
with and elaborating the input phrase. Detail
of the support tools will be given in the next
section.
Title revision wizard is implemented in PHP
(Hypertext Preprocessor). Users can access the
wizard using a web browser such as Internet Ex-
plorer.
3 Support Tools provided in the
Wizard
In this section, we explain the three support
tools provided in the title revision wizard.
3.1 Database of Paper Titles and
Newspapers Headlines for Related
Technologies
It is difficult for inexperienced authors to come
up with a phrase meeting the three key points.
We therefore prepared a parallel corpus of titles
and headlines for related technologies in order
to provide clues for coming up with an appropri-
ate phrase. The database consists of about 420
titles and 440 headlines. They were categorized
into 150 groups on technology that has been de-
veloped in a research institute, and covers sci-
ence and technology in general. The database
is (b) in Figure 1.
Figure 3 shows an example of the database
window. The upper pane in the window shows
the phrases in titles and the headlines describ-
ing related technologies. The lower part of the
window presents search boxes for menu-based
retrieval and keyword-based retrieval. The pull-
down menu options are organized by technical
fields. Users can search the clues for revising the
title of the draft version from these search boxes
as well as by scrolling through the window.
The role of this parallel corpus is basi-
cally the same as the one of ?Example-Based
Translation Aid (EBTA)? (Sato, 1992) (Furu-
gori and Takeda, 1993) (Kumano and Tanaka,
1998). EBTA researches have shown that par-
allel translation examples (pairs of source text
and its translation equivalent) are very helpful
for translators to translate the similar text be-
cause parallel translation examples give them
useful clues for translation. From the viewpoint
that paper titles and newspapers headlines for
related technologies are also regarded as paral-
lel translation examples (pairs of text for spe-
cialists and its translation equivalent for lay
readers) describing newly-developed technolo-
gies, the our database is expected to be helpful
for the user of the wizard.
3.2 Technical Terms Checker
The author should use comprehensible term for
lay readers in order to compose the titles meet-
ing the key point 1. In order to avoid incompre-
hensible terms, it is important to identify diffi-
culty level of a term that authors want to use in
his/her title. We, therefore, prepared ?techni-
cal term checker? estimating the difficulty level
of a term.
It has been reported that human recognition
level of a term correlates with its frequency of
appearance (Homes and Solomon, 1951). From
that standpoint, it is considered that frequency
of a term on the academic website represents
the recognition level of a term for the special-
ists of the field, and that frequency of the term
on the general website represents the one for
laypersons of the field. On the basis of this con-
cept, our ?technical term checker? estimates the
difficulty level of a technical term on the basis
of the frequencies on the academic and general
website, and then inform the users about the re-
sult on three level (?plain?, ?may be difficult?,
?difficult?).

Figure 3: Parallel Corpus of Titles and Headlines for Related Technology
3.3 Menu Options of the Phrases Used
in Newspapers Headlines
In order to meet key point 3, the authors have to
consider how to represent the advantages of the
technologies from various viewpoints, and come
up with the phrase that can concisely represent
the advantages. However, it is considered that
those who have a detailed knowledge of a techni-
cal field are unaccustomed to represent the ad-
vantages of the technologies in a title because
previous research showed that most of technical
paper titles in Japanese does not included such
a phrase (Senda and Sinohara, 2002).
We therefore prepared the pull-down menu
options of the phrases representing technical ad-
vantages used in newspapers headlines. The
menu options presents about 70 phrases catego-
rized by the way to describe the advantages of
technology. For example, in our menu options,
the following phrases are listed by the following
group: high density, high concentration, high
accuracy, . . . , low price, low cost, low pollution,
. . . , long-lived, long distance, . . . , short time,
short duration, . . . , ; etc 2 .
Figure 4 shows the menu options installed at
the title template for key point 3. This menu
options can help the users come up with or elab-
orate on the phrases by offering various expres-
sions and viewpoints.
4 Effect of Title Revision Wizard
In order to test the effect of the title revision
wizard, we conducted an experiment which had
17 technical researchers revise their titles with
and without using our wizard. We then con-
ducted a questionnaire survey on the effect of
the titles on the interest of lay readers.
4.1 Outline of the Experiment
We conducted the experiment according to the
following procedures.
Experiment 1 (Ex 1)
1. We showed each subject his technical pa-
per title (published after 2000) on his
own developed technology. We asked him
to imagine himself writing an explanation
of the same technology for lay readers.
2. We asked each subject to compose three
candidates of title for the explanation by
his own effort (that is, without our wiz-
ard) within the 20-minute time limit.
Experiment 2 (Ex 2)
1. After Ex 1, we input original technical
paper title into first title template of our
title revision wizard (for draft title), and
presented each subject with the wizard.
2. We asked each subject to compose candi-
dates of titles for the same document us-
ing the wizard and select thee titles from
the candidates within the 20-minute time
limit.
The research fields of subjects were physics,
electrical engineering, material science and me-
teorology. There was no intermission between
Ex 1 and 2.
2These sample phrases are translated into English
from original Japanese phrases.
4.2 Outline of the Questionnaire
Survey
In the questionnaire, each respondent was
shown seven titles per one technology that each
subject developed. They consisted of an origi-
nal technical paper title, three titles composed
at Ex 1, and three titles composed at Ex 2. Each
respondent was asked to select three-most inter-
esting titles from these 7 titles per one technol-
ogy.
Respondents to the questionnaire were 108
persons and general monitors of an Internet re-
search firm. We asked them to answer our ques-
tionnaire on a Web page which was prepared for
this survey.
This means, of course, that the results of the
questionnaire only contain responses from peo-
ple who have some skill at using the Internet,
rather than the public at large, because all re-
spondents were able to use E-mail and access
the web page. However, at least, the result
helps to write document on a Web page which
explains new technology for lay readers.
Moreover, the result is also an exercise in
reaching the general lay readers over the Inter-
net, and the use of the Internet is expected to
be increasingly important in reaching the gen-
eral public.
4.3 Analysis of Experiment and
Questionnaire Survey
Figure 5 shows the (average) share of the vote
which the respondents select three-most inter-
esting titles from each author?s seven titles (by
method of composing). Figure 5 indicates that:
 The average share of the vote of the titles
revised using the wizard are distributed
within the highest range.
 The average share of the vote of the titles
revised without using the wizard are dis-
tributed within the second highest range,
 The share of the vote of original techni-
cal paper titles are distributed within the
third highest range,
We checked if there is a significant difference
between the (average) share of the vote of orig-
inal technical paper titles and the titles revised
without using the wizard by t-test. As the re-
sult, we confirmed that there is a significant dif-
ference between these titles (the significant level
is 1%). We also checked if there is a significant
difference between the share of the vote of the
titles revised with and without using the wizard

Figure 5: Histogram of Share of the Vote
which the Respondents Select Three-
most Interesting Titles from Each Au-
thor?s 7 Titles (by Method of Composing)
by t-test. As the result, We also confirmed that
there is a significant difference between these
titles (the significant level is 5%).
These results show that the titles composed
using the wizard could stimulate the lay readers?
interest the most among each subject?s seven
titles. In other words, the authors can stably
compose the more appealing titles for lay read-
ers with using the wizard than without using
the wizard.
If an author could compose effective titles by
himself, he might not take an advantage from
the wizard. We, therefore, focused only on
seven subjects who could not compose the ti-
tles stimulating a majority of the respondents?
interest without the wizard, and analyze the ef-

fect of their titles on the respondents? interest
in more detail.
We, then, compared the average share of the
vote for the titles which each of the seven au-
thor revised with and without using the wizard.
figure 6 shows that all the subjects can stably
compose the more appealing titles with using
the wizard than without using the wizard. We
checked if there is a significant difference be-
tween the share of the vote of the titles revised
with and without using the wizard by t-test. As
the result, We also confirmed that there is a sig-
nificant difference between these titles (the sig-
nificant level is 1%).
As the result of the above analysis, we con-
firmed that the title revision wizard can help
the users who cannot compose effective titles
by their own efforts.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We emphasized that, in order to stimulate the
lay reader?s interest in newly-developed technol-
ogy, it is very important to compose an appeal-
ing title, however it is difficult for inexperienced
authors to come up with an appealing title.
In this research, we developed a title revi-
sion wizard that provides a guidance on revising
draft title and a few support tools for coming
up with and elaborating on appealing phrases.
Moreover, we verified the effect of the title re-
vision wizard. As a result, the titles composed
using the wizard can stimulate the lay reader?s
interest more than the titles composed without
using the wizard. In particular, our title revi-
sion wizard can help the users who cannot com-
pose effective titles by their own effort.
In future work, we will analyze the difference
of the expression of the titles composed with
and without using the wizard, and investigate
what sort expression is effective to lay readers.
