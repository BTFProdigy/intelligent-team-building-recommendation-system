Abstract
Wiktionary, a satellite of the Wikipedia
initiative, can be seen as a potential re-
source for Natural Language Processing.
It requires however to be processed be-
fore being used efficiently as an NLP re-
source. After describing the relevant as-
pects of Wiktionary for our purposes, we
focus on its structural properties. Then,
we describe how we extracted synonymy
networks from this resource. We pro-
vide an in-depth study of these synonymy
networks and compare them to those ex-
tracted from traditional resources. Fi-
nally, we describe two methods for semi-
automatically improving this network by
adding missing relations: (i) using a kind
of semantic proximity measure; (ii) using
translation relations of Wiktionary itself.
Note: The experiments of this paper are based on Wik-
tionary?s dumps downloaded in year 2008. Differences may
be observed with the current versions available online.
1 Introduction
Reliable and comprehensive lexical resources con-
stitute a crucial prerequisite for various NLP tasks.
However their building cost keeps them rare. In
this context, the success of the Princeton Word-
Net (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) can be explained by
the quality of the resource but also by the lack of
serious competitors. Widening this observation to
more languages only makes this observation more
acute. In spite of various initiatives, costs make
resource development extremely slow or/and re-
sult in non freely accessible resources. Collabo-
rative resources might bring an attractive solution
to this difficult situation. Among them Wiktionary
seems to be the perfect resource for building com-
putational mono-lingual and multi-lingual lexica.
This paper focuses therefore on Wiktionary, how
to improve it, and on its exploitation for creating
resources.
In next section, we present some relevant infor-
mation about Wiktionary. Section 3 presents the
lexical graphs we are using and the way we build
them. Then we pay some attention to evaluation
(?4) before exploring some tracks of improvement
suggested by Wiktionary structure itself.
2 Wiktionary
As previously said, NLP suffers from a lack of
lexical resources, be it due to the low-quality or
non-existence of such resources, or to copyrights-
related problems. As an example, we consider
French language resources. Jacquin et al (2002)
highlighted the limitations and inconsistencies
from the French EuroWordnet. Later, Sagot and
Fi?er (2008) explained how they needed to re-
course to PWN, BalkaNet (Tufis, 2000) and other
resources (notably Wikipedia) to build WOLF, a
free French WordNet that is promising but still a
very preliminary resource. Some languages are
straight-off purely under-resourced.
The Web as Corpus initiative arose (Kilgarriff
and Grefenstette, 2003) as an attempt to design
tools and methodologies to use the web for over-
coming data sparseness (Keller and Lapata, 2002).
Nevertheless, this initiative raised non-trivial tech-
nical problems described in Baroni et al (2008).
Moreover, the web is not structured enough to eas-
ily and massively extract semantic relations.
In this context, Wiktionary could appear to be
a paradisiac playground for creating various lexi-
19
cal resources. We describe below the Wiktionary
resource and we explain the restrictions and prob-
lems we are facing when trying to exploit it. This
description may complete few earlier ones, for ex-
ample Zesch et al (2008a).
2.1 Collaborative editing
Wiktionary, the lexical companion to Wikipedia,
is a collaborative project to produce a free-content
multilingual dictionary.
1
As the other Wikipedia?s
satellite projects, the resource is not experts-led,
rather filled by any kind of users. The might-be
inaccuracy of the resulting resource has lengthily
been discussed and we will not debate it: see Giles
(2005) and Britannica (2006) for an illustration
of the controversy. Nevertheless, we think that
Wiktionary should be less subject (so far) than
Wikipedia to voluntary misleading content (be it
for ideological, commercial reasons, or alike).
2.2 Articles content
As one may expect, a Wiktionary article
2
may (not
systematically) give information on a word?s part
of speech, etymology, definitions, examples, pro-
nunciation, translations, synonyms/antonyms, hy-
pernyms/hyponyms, etc.
2.2.1 Multilingual aspects
Wiktionary?s multilingual organisation may be
surprising and not always meet one?s expectations
or intuitions. Wiktionaries exist in 172 languages,
but we can read on the English language main
page, ?1,248,097 entries with English definitions
from over 295 languages?. Indeed, a given wik-
tionary describes the words in its own language
but also foreign words. For example, the English
article moral includes the word in English (adjec-
tive and noun) and Spanish (adjective and noun)
but not in French. Another example, boucher,
which does not exist in English, is an article of the
English wiktionary, dedicated to the French noun
(a butcher) and French verb (to cork up).
A given wiktionary?s ?in other languages? left
menu?s links, point to articles in other wiktionar-
ies describing the word in the current language.
For example, the Fran?ais link in the dictionary
article of the English wiktionary points to an arti-
cle in the French one, describing the English word
dictionary.
1
http://en.wiktionary.org/
2
What article refers to is more fuzzy than classical entry
or acceptance means.
2.2.2 Layouts
In the following paragraph, we outline wik-
tionary?s general structure. We only consider
words in the wiktionary?s own language.
An entry consists of a graphical form and a cor-
responding article that is divided into the follow-
ing, possibly embedded, sections:
? etymology sections separate homonyms when
relevant;
? among an etymology section, different parts
of speech may occur;
? definitions and examples belong to a part of
speech section and may be subdivided into sub-
senses;
? translations, synonyms/antonyms and hy-
pernyms/hyponyms are linked to a given part of
speech, with or without subsenses distinctions.
In figure 1 is depicted an article?s layout example.
Figure 1: Layout of boot article (shortened)
About subsenses, they are identified with an in-
dex when first introduced but they may appear as
a plain text semantic feature (without index) when
used in relations (translations, synonyms, etc.). It
is therefore impossible to associate the relations
arguments to subsenses. Secondly, subsense index
appears only in the current word (the source of the
relation) and not in the target word?s article it is
linked to (see orange French N. and Adj., Jan. 10,
2008
3
).
A more serious issue appears when relations are
shared by several parts of speech sections. In Ital-
3
http://fr.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?
title=orange&oldid=2981313
20
ian, both synonyms and translations parts are com-
mon to all words categories (see for example car-
dinale N. and Adj., Apr. 26, 2009
4
).
2.3 Technical issues
As Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia Founda-
tion?s projects, the Wiktionary?s content manage-
ment system relies on the MediaWiki software
and on the wikitext. As stated in Wikipedia?s
MetaWiki article, ?no formal syntax has been de-
fined? for the MediaWiki and consequently it is
not possible to write a 100% reliable parser.
Unlike Wikipedia, no HTML dump is available
and one has to parse the Wikicode. Wikicode
is difficult to handle since wiki templates require
handwritten rules that need to be regularly up-
dated. Another difficulty is the language-specific
encoding of the information. Just to mention one,
the target language of a translation link is iden-
tified by a 2 or 3 letters ISO-639 code for most
languages. However in the Polish wiktionary the
complete name of the language name (angielski,
francuski, . . . ) is used.
2.4 Parsing and modeling
The (non-exhaustive) aforementioned list of diffi-
culties (see ?2.2.2 and ?2.3) leads to the following
consequences:
? Writing a parser for a given wiktionary is
possible only after an in-depth observation of its
source. Even an intensive work will not prevent
all errors as long as (i) no syntax-checking is made
when editing an article and (ii) flexibility with the
?tacitly agreed? layout conventions is preserved.
Better, flexibility is presented as a characteristic of
the framework:
?[. . . ] it is not a set of rigid rules. You may
experiment with deviations, but other editors
may find those deviations unacceptable, and
revert those changes. They have just as much
right to do that as you have to make them.
5
?
Moreover, a parser has to be updated every new
dump, as templates, layout conventions (and so
on) may change.
?Writing parsers for different languages is not a
simple adjustment, rather a complete overhaul.
? When extracting a network of semantic rela-
tions from a given wiktionary, some choices are
more driven by the wiktionary inner format than
scientific modelling choices. An illustration fol-

lows in ?3.2. When merging information extracted
from several languages, the homogenisation of the
data structure often leads to the choice of the poor-
est one, resulting in a loss of information.
2.5 The bigger the better?
Taking advantage of colleagues mastering various
languages, we studied the wiktionary of the fol-
lowing languages: French, English, German, Pol-
ish and Mandarin Chinese. A first remark con-
cerns the size of the resource. The official num-
ber of declared articles in a given wiktionary in-
cludes a great number of meta-articles which are
not word entries As of April 2009, the French wik-
tionary reaches the first rank
6
, before the English
one. This can be explained by the automated im-
port of public-domain dictionaries articles (Littr?
1863 and Dictionnaire de l?Acad?mie Fran?aise
1932-1935). Table 1 shows the ratio between the
total number of articles and the ?relevant? ones
(numbers based on year 2008 snapshots).

Table 1: Ratio of ?relevant? articles in wiktionaries
By ?relevant?, we mean an article about a word
in the wiktionary?s own language (e.g. not an
article about a French word in the English Wik-
tionary). Among the ?relevant? articles, some
are empty and some do not contain any transla-
tion nor synonym link. Therefore, before deciding
to use Wiktionary, it is necessary to compare the
amount of extracted information contribution and
the amount of work required to obtain it .
3 Study of synonymy networks
In this section, we study synonymy networks built
from different resources. First, we introduce
some general properties of lexical networks (?3.1).
Then we explain how we build Wiktionary?s syn-
onymy network and how we analyse its proper-
ties. In ?3.3, we show how we build similar graphs
from traditional resources for evaluation purposes.
3.1 Structure of lexical networks
In the following sections, a graph G = (V,E)
is defined by a set V of n vertices and a set
E ? V
2
of m edges. In this paper, V is
6
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_
of_Wiktionaries
21
a set of words and E is defined by a relation
E
R
7?? E : (w
1
, w
2
) ? E if and only if w
1
R
? w
2
.
Most of lexical networks, as networks extracted
from real world, are small worlds (SW) net-
works. Comparing structural characteristics of
wiktionary-based lexical networks to some stan-
dard resource should be done according to well-
known properties of SW networks (Watts and
Strogatz, 1998; Barabasi et al, 2000; Newman,
2003; Gaume et al, 2008). These properties are:
? Edge sparsity: SW are sparse in edges
m = O(n) or m = O(n log(n))
? Short paths: in SW, the average path length
(L)
7
is short. Generally there is at least one short
path between any two nodes.
? High clustering: in SW, the clustering coef-
ficient (C) that expresses the probability that two
distinct nodes adjacent to a given third one are ad-
jacent, is an order of magnitude higher than for
Erdos-Renyi (random) graphs: C
SW
 C
random
;
this indicates that the graph is locally dense, al-
though it is globally sparse.
?Heavy-tailed degree distribution: the distri-
bution of the vertices incidence degrees follows a
power law in a SW graph. The probability P (k)
that a given node has k neighbours decreases as a
power law, P (k) ? k
a
(a being a constant charac-
teristic of the graph). Random graphs conforms to
a Poisson Law.
3.2 Wiktionary?s network
Graph extraction Considering what said in
?2.2.2 and ?2.4, we made the following choices:
8
? Vertices: a vertex is built for each entry?s part
of speech.
? Parts of speech: when modeling the links
from X (X having for part of speech Pos
X
) to
one of its synonyms Y , we assume that Pos
Y
=
Pos
X
, thus building vertex Pos
Y
.Y.
? Subsenses: subsenses are flattened. First, the
subsenses are not always mentioned in the syn-
onyms section. Second, if we take into account
the subsenses, they only appear in the source of the
relation. For example, considering in figure 1 the
relation boot
syn
??? kick (both nouns), and given the
10 subsenses for boot and the 5 ones for kick, we
should build 15 vertices. And we should then add
7
Average length of the shortest path between any two
nodes.
8
These choices can clearly be discussed from a linguis-
tic point of view and judged to be biased. Nevertheless, we
adopted them as a first approximation to make the modelling
possible.
all the links between the mentioned boot?s sub-
senses and the 5 kick?s existing subsenses. This
would lead to a high number of edges, but the
graph would not be closer to the reality. The way
subsenses appear in Wiktionary are unpredictable.
"Subsenses" correspond sometimes to homonyms
or clear-cut senses of polysemous words, but can
also correspond to facets, word usage or regu-
lar polysemy. Moreover, some entries have no
subsenses distinction whereas it would be wor-
thy. More globally, the relevance of discrete word
senses has been seriously questioned, see (Victorri
and Fuchs, 1996) or (Kilgarriff, 1997) for very
convincing discussions. Two more practical rea-
sons led us to this choice. We want our method to
be reproducible for other languages and some wik-
tionaries do not include subsenses. At last, some
gold standard resources (eg. Dicosyn) have their
subsenses flattened too and we want to compare
the resources against each other.
? Edges: wiktionary?s synonymy links are ori-
ented but we made the graph symmetric. For ex-
ample, boot does not appear in kick?s synonyms.
Some words even appear as synonyms without be-
ing an entry of Wiktionary.
From the boot example (figure 1), we extract ver-
tices {N.boot, V.boot}, build {N.buskin,
N.kick, V.kick} and we add the follow-
ing (symmetrized) edges: N.boot?N.buskin,
N.boot?N.kick and V.boot?V.kick.
Graph properties By observing the table 2, we
can see that the graphs of synonyms extracted
from Wiktionary are all typical small worlds. In-
deed their l
lcc
remains short, their C
lcc
is always
greater or equal than 0.2 and their distribution
curves of the vertices incidence degree is very
close to a power law (a least-square method gives
always exponent a
lcc
? ?2.35 with a confidence
r
2
lcc
always greater than 0.89). It can also be seen
that the average incidence k
lcc
ranges from 2.32
to 3.32.
9
It means that no matter which language
9
It is noteworthy that the mean incidence of vertices is al-
most always the same (close to 2.8) no matter the graph size
is. If we assume that all wiktionary?s graphs grow in a similar
way but at different speed rates (after all it is the same frame-
work), graphs (at least their statistical properties) from differ-
ent languages can be seen as snapshots of the same graph at
different times. This would mean that the number of graphs
edges tends to grow proportionally with the number of ver-
tices. This fits with the dynamic properties of small worlds
(Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005). It means that for a wik-
tionary system, even with many contributions, graph density
is likely to remain constant and we will see that in compar-
ison to traditional lexical resources this density is quite low.

3.3 Building synonymy networks from
known standards
WordNet There are many possible ways for
building lexical networks from PWN. We tried
several methods but only two of them are worth
to be mentioned here. The graphs we built have
words as vertices, not synsets or senses. A first
straightforward method (method A) consists in
adding an edge between two vertices only if the
corresponding words appear as elements of the
same synset. This method produced many discon-
nected graphs of various sizes. Both the compu-
tational method we planned to use and our intu-
itions about such graphs were pointing towards a
bigger graph that would cover most of the lexical
network.
We therefore decided to exploit the hypernymy
relation. Traditional dictionaries indeed propose
hypernyms when one look for synonyms of very
specific terms, making hypernymy the closest re-
lation to synonymy at least from a lexicographic
viewpoint. However, adding all the hypernymy re-
lations resulted in a network extremely dense in
edges with some vertices having a high number of
neighbours. This was due to the tree-like organi-
sation of WordNet that gives a very special impor-
tance to higher nodes of the tree.
In the end we retained method B that consists in
adding edges in following cases:
? if two words belong to the same synset;
? if a word only appears in a synset that is a leaf
of the tree and contains only this word, then cre-
ate edges linking to words included in the hyper-
nym(s) synset.
We would like to study the evolution through time of wik-
tionaries, however this is outside the scope of this paper.
Therefore when a vertice w do not get any neigh-
bour according to method A, method B adds edges
linking w to words included in the hypernym(s)
synset of the synset {w}. We only added hyper-
nyms for the leaves of the tree in order to keep our
relations close to the synonymy idea. This idea has
already been exploited for some WordNet-based
semantic distances calculation taking into account
the depth of the relation in the tree (Leacock and
Chodorow, 1998).
Dicosyn graphs Dicosyn is a compilation of
synonym relations extracted from seven dictionar-
ies (Bailly, Benac, Du Chazaud, Guizot, Lafaye,
Larousse and Robert):
10
there is an edge r ? s if
and only if r and s have the same syntactic cate-
gory and at least one dictionary proposes s being
a synonym in the dictionary entry r. Then, each
of the three graphs (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives) ob-
tained is made symmetric (dicosyn-fr-N, dicosyn-
fr-V and dicosyn-fr-A).
Properties of the graphs extracted Table 3
sums-up the structural properties of the synonyms
networks built from standard resources.
We can see that all the synonymy graphs ex-
tracted from PWN or Dicosyn are SW graphs.
Indeed their l
lcc
remains short, their C
lcc
is al-
ways greater or equal than 0.35 and their distri-
bution curves of the vertices incidence degree is
very close to a power law (a least-square method
gives always exponent a
lcc
near of ?2.30 with a
confidence r
2
lcc
always greater than 0.85). It can
also be observed that no matter the part of speech,
the average incidence of Dicosyn-based graphs is
always lower than WordNet ones.
10
Dicosyn has been first produced at ATILF, before being
corrected at CRISCO laboratory.

Table 3: Gold standard?s synonymy graphs properties
4 Wiktionary graphs evaluation
Coverage and global SW analysis By compar-
ing tables 2 and 3, one can observe that:
? The lexical coverage of Wiktionary-based syn-
onyms graphs is always quantitatively lower than
those of standard resources although this may
change. For example, to horn (in PWN), absent
from Wiktionary in 2008, appeared in 2009. At
last, Wiktionary is more inclined to include some
class of words such as to poo (childish) or to
prefetch, to google (technical neologisms).
? The average number of synonyms for an en-
try of a Wiktionary-based resource is smaller than
those of standard resources. For example, com-
mon synonyms such as to act/to play appear in
PWN and not in Wiktionary. Nevertheless, some
other appear (rightly) in Wiktionary: to reduce/to
decrease, to cook/to microwave.
? The clustering rate of Wiktionary-based
graphs is always smaller than those of standard re-
sources. This is particularly the case for English.
However, this specificity might be due to differ-
ences between the resources themselves (Dicosyn
vs. PWN) rather than structural differences at the
linguistic level.
Evaluation of synonymy In order to evaluate
the quality of extracted synonymy graphs from
Wiktionary, we use recall and precision measure.
The objects we compare are not simple sets but
graphs (G = (V ;E)), thus we should compare
separately set of vertices (V ) and set of edges (E).
Vertices are words and edges are synonymy links.
Vertices evaluation leads to measure the resource
(a) English Wiktionary vs. Wordnet
Precision Recall
Nouns 14120/22075 = 0.64 14120/117798 = 0.12
Adj. 5874/8437 = 0.70 5874/21479 = 0.27
Verbs 5157/6368 = 0.81 5157/11529 = 0.45
(b) French Wiktionary vs. Dicosyn
Precision Recall
Nouns 10393/18017 = 0.58 10393/29372 = 0.35
Adj. 3076/5411 = 0.57 3076/9452 = 0.33
Verbs 2966/3897 = 0.76 2966/9147 = 0.32
Table 4: Wiktionary coverage
coverage whereas edges evaluation leads to mea-
sure the quality of the synonymy links in Wik-
tionary resource.
First of all, the global picture (table 4) shows
clearly that the lexical coverage is rather poor. A
lot of words included in standard resources are not
included yet in the corresponding wiktionary re-
sources. Overall the lexical coverage is always
lower than 50%. This has to be kept in mind while
looking at the evaluation of relations shown in ta-
ble 5. To compute the relations evaluation, each
resource has been first restricted to the links be-
tween words being present in each resource.
About PWN, since every link added with
method A will also be added with method B, the
precision of Wiktionary-based graphs synonyms
links will be always lower for "method A graphs"
than for "method B graphs". Precision is rather
good while recall is very low. That means that a
lot of synonymy links of the standard resources
are missing within Wiktionary. As for Dicosyn,
the picture is similar with even better precision but
very low recall.
5 Exploiting Wiktionary for improving
Wiktionary
As seen in section 4, Wiktionary-based resources
are very incomplete with regard to synonymy. We
propose two tasks for adding some of these links:
Task 1: Adding synonyms to Wiktionary by
taking into account its Small World characteristics
for proposing new synonyms.
(a) English wiktionary vs. Wordnet
Precision Recall
Nouns (A) 2503/6453 = 0.39 2503/11021 = 0.23
Nouns (B) 2763/6453 = 0.43 2763/18440 = 0.15
Adj. (A) 786/3139 = 0.25 786/5712 = 0.14
Adj. (B) 1314/3139 = 0.42 1314/12792 = 0.10
Verbs (A) 866/2667 = 0.32 866/10332 = 0.08
Verbs (B) 993/2667 = 0.37 993/18725 = 0.05
(b) French wiktionary vs. Dicosyn
Precision Recall
Nouns 3510/5075 = 0.69 3510/44501 = 0.08
Adj. 1300/1677 = 0.78 1300/17404 = 0.07
Verbs 899/1267 = 0.71 899/23968 = 0.04
Table 5: Wiktionary synonymy links precision & recall
24
Task 2: Adding synonyms to Wiktionary by
taking into account the translation relations.
We evaluate these two tasks against the bench-
marks presented in section 3.2.
5.1 Improving synonymy in Wiktionary by
exploiting its small world structure
We propose here to enrich synonymy links of Wik-
tionary by taking into account that lexical net-
works have a high clustering coefficient. Our hy-
pothesis is that missing links in Wiktionary should
be within clusters.
A high clustering coefficient means that two
words which are connected to a third one are likely
to be connected together. In other words neigh-
bours of my neighbours should also be in my
neighbourhood. We propose to reverse this prop-
erty to the following hypothesis: "neighbour of my
neighbours which are not in my neighbourhood
should be a good neighbour candidate". Thus the
first method we test consist simply in connecting
every vertex to neighbours of its neighbours. One
can repeat this operation until the expected num-
ber of edges is obtained.
11
Secondly we used the PROX approach pro-
posed by (Gaume et al, 2009). It is a stochastic
method designed for studying ?Hierarchical Small
Worlds?. Briefly put, for a given vertex u, one
computes for all other vertices v the probability
that a randomly wandering particle starting from
u stands in v after a fixed number of steps. Let
P (u, v) be this value. We propose to connect u
to the k first vertices ranked in descending order
with respect of P (u, v). We always choose k pro-
portionally to the original degree of u (number of
neighbours of u).
For a small number of steps (3 in our case) ran-
dom wanderings tend to be trapped into local clus-
ter structures. So a vertex v with a high P (u, v) is
likely to belong to the same cluster as u, which
means that a link u?v might be relevant.
Figure 2 shows precision, recall and f-score
evolution for French verbs graph when edges are
added using ?neighourhood? method (neigh), and
using ?Prox? method. Dashed line correspond to
the value theoretically obtained by choosing edges
at random. First, both methods are clearly more
efficient than a random addition, which is not sur-
prising but it seems to confirm our hypothesis that
missing edges are within clusters. Adding sharply
11
We repeat it only two times, otherwise the number of
added edges is too large.

Figure 2: Precision, recall and F-score of French verbs
graph enlarged using only existing synonymy links
neighbours of neighbours seems to be as good as
adding edges ranked by Prox, anyway the rank
provided by Prox permits to add a given number
of edges. This ranking can also be useful to order
potential links if one think about a user validation
system. Synonyms added by Prox and absent from
gold standards are not necessarily false.
For example Prox proposes a relevant link ab-
solve/forgive, not included in PWN. Moreover,
many false positive are still interesting to consider
for improving the resource. For example, Prox
adds relations such as hypernyms (to uncover/to
peel) or inter-domain ?synonyms? (to skin/to peel).
This is due to high clustering (see ?3.1) and to
the fact that clusters in synonymy networks corre-
lates with language concepts (Gaume et al, 2008;
Duvignau and Gaume, 2008; Gaume et al, 2009;
Fellbaum, 1999).
Finally note that results are similar for other
parts of speech and other languages.
5.2 Using Wiktionary?s translation links to
improve its synonymy network
Assuming that two words sharing many transla-
tions in different languages are likely to be syn-
onymous, we propose to use Wiktionary?s transla-
tion links to enhance the synonymy network of a
given language.
In order to rank links to be potentially added,
we use a simple Jaccard measure: let T
w
be the set
of a word w?s translations, then for every couple
of words (w,w
?
) we have:
Jaccard(w,w
?
) =
|T
w
? T
w
?
|
|T
w
? T
w
?
|
We compute this measure for every possible pair
of words and then, starting from Wiktionary?s syn-
onymy graph, we incrementally add links accord-
ing to their Jaccard rank.
25
We notice first that most of synonymy links
added by this method were not initially included
in Wiktionary?s synonymy network. For exam-
ple, regarding English verbs, 95% of 2000 best
ranked proposed links are new. Hence this method
may be efficient to improve graph density. How-
ever one can wonder about the quality of the new
added links, so we discuss precision in the next
paragraph.
In figure 3 is depicted the evolution of precision,
recall and F-score for French verbs in the enlarged
graph in regard of the total number of edges. We
use Dicosyn graph as a gold standard. The dashed
line corresponds to theoretical scores one can ex-
pect by adding randomly chosen links.
First we notice that both precision and recall
are significantly higher than we can expect from
random addition. This confirms that words shar-
ing the same translations are good synonym candi-
dates. Added links seem to be particularly relevant
at the beginning for higher Jaccard scores. From
the first dot to the second one we add about 1000
edges (whereas the original graph contains 1792
edges) and the precision only decreases from 0.71
to 0.69.
The methods we proposed in this section are
quite simple and there is room for improvement.
First, both methods can be combined in order
to improve the resource using translation links
and then using clusters structure. One can also
think to the corollary task that would consists in
adding translation links between two languages
using synonymy links of others languages.

6 Conclusion and future work
This paper gave us the opportunity to share some
Wiktionary experience related lexical resources
building. We presented in addition two approaches
for improving these resources and their evaluation.
The first approach relies on the small world struc-
ture of synonymy networks. We postulated that
many missing links in Wiktionary should be added
among members of the same cluster. The second
approach assumes that two words sharing many
translations in different languages are likely to be
synonymous. The comparison with traditional re-
sources shows that our hypotheses are confirmed.
We now plan to combine both approaches.
The work presented in this paper combines a
NLP contribution involving data extraction and
rough processing of the data and a mathematical
contribution concerning graph-like resource. In
our viewpoint the second aspect of our work is
therefore complementary of other NLP contribu-
tions, like (Zesch et al, 2008b), involving more
sophisticated NLP processing of the resource.
Support for collaborative editing Our results
should be useful for setting up a more efficient
framework for Wiktionary collaborative editing.
We should be able to always propose a set of syn-
onymy relations that are likely to be. For exam-
ple, when a contributor creates or edits an arti-
cle, he may think about adding very few links but
might not bother providing an exhaustive list of
synonyms. Our tool can propose a list of potential
synonyms, ordered by relevancy. Each item of this
list would only need to be validated (or not).
Diachronic study An interesting topic for future
work is a "diachronic" study of the resource. It
is possible to access Wiktionary at several stages,
this can be used for studying how such resources
evolve. Grounded on this kind of study, one may
predict the evolution of newer wiktionaries and
foresee contributors? NLP needs. We would like
to set up a framework for everyone to test out new
methodologies for enriching and using Wiktionary
resources. Such observatory, would allow to fol-
low not only the evolution of Wiktionary but also
of Wiktionary-grounded resources, that will only
improve thanks to steady collaborative develop-
ment.
Invariants and variabality Wiktionary as a
massively mutiligual synonymy networks is an
extremely promising resource for studying the
(in)variability of semantic pairings such as
house/family, child/fruit, feel/know... (Sweetser,
1991; Gaume et al, 2009). A systematic study
within the semantic approximation framework
presented in the paper on Wiktionary data will be
carried on in the future.

Abstract
Edges of graphs that model real data can be
seen as judgements whether pairs of objects
are in relation with each other or not. So,
one can evaluate the similarity of two graphs
with a measure of agreement between judges
classifying pairs of vertices into two cate-
gories (connected or not connected). When
applied to synonymy networks, such measures
demonstrate a surprisingly low agreement be-
tween various resources of the same language.
This seems to suggest that the judgements
on synonymy of lexemes of the same lexi-
con radically differ from one dictionary ed-
itor to another. In fact, even a strong dis-
agreement between edges does not necessarily
mean that graphs model a completely differ-
ent reality: although their edges seem to dis-
agree, synonymy resources may, at a coarser
grain level, outline similar semantics. To in-
vestigate this hypothesis, we relied on shared
common properties of real world data net-
works to look at the graphs at a more global
level by using random walks. They enabled
us to reveal a much better agreement between
dense zones than between edges of synonymy
graphs. These results suggest that although
synonymy resources may disagree at the level
of judgements on single pairs of words, they
may nevertheless convey an essentially simi-
lar semantic information.
1 Introduction
More and more resources exist, built with various
approaches and methods and with many different
aims and intended uses. A new issue raised by this
growth is that of comparing various resources. A
lexical resource is usually based on semantic judge-
ments about lexical elements (a human judgement
performed by a lexicographer, or a machine-based
judgement in the case of automatically built re-
sources). Often, two independently built resources
that describe the same linguistic reality only show a
weak agreement even when based on human judge-
ments under the same protocol (Murray and Green,
2004).
Many of such resources, such as WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) or Wiktionary1 (Zesch et al, 2008;
Sajous et al, 2010) can be modelled as graphs. A
graph encodes a binary relation on a set V of ver-
tices. A graph G = (V,E) is therefore defined by
a finite, non empty set of n = |V | vertices and by
a set E ? V ? V of m = |E| couples of vertices
(edges). In the linguistic field, vertices can be vari-
ous elements of the lexicon: lemmas, word senses,
syntactic frames... and edges can describe various
relations: synonymy, hyperonymy, translation, co-
occurrence... Edges between two vertices can be
seen as judgements that decide whether the consid-
ered relation applies to this pair. For example, in a
synonymy graph, an edge exists between two words
if they were judged to be synonyms by the lexicogra-
pher who was compiling the dictionary. So, different
graphs that model dictionaries of synonyms are built
according to the judgements of various ?judges?.
We first illustrate, in section 2, how various stan-
dard synonymy resources of English and French
share common structural properties: they all are Hi-
erarchical Small Worlds (HSW). However, we then
1http://www.wiktionary.org/
15
show that the synonymy judgements they describe
seem to disagree: the Kappa (Cohen, 1960) between
the edges of any two such resources remains surpris-
ingly low. In the third section, we analyse this appar-
ent disagreement and in section 4, we address it by
proposing an alternative view of the networks, based
on random walks. This more global view enables us
to assess if disagreeing synonymy networks never-
theless concord at a more global level, because they
model the same linguistic reality. Beyond the usual
Kappa agreement measure, which is based on the lo-
cal comparison of two category judgements (a pair is
or is not a pair of synonyms), we can show that syn-
onymy judgements do not essentially diverge on the
lexical semantic structure that emerges from them.
In the fifth section, we conclude by outlining possi-
ble applications and perspectives of this work.
2 Graph modelling of various synonymy
resources
In order to study the similarities and variations of
lexical resources, let us study a sample of graphs that
model several standard synonymy resources. We
analyse five standard, general purpose, paper dictio-
naries of French synonyms2: Bailly (Bai), Benac
(Ben), Bertaud du Chazaut (Ber), Larousse (Lar),
Robert (Rob). We also study synonymy relations ex-
tracted from the Princeton Word Net (PWN ) and
from the English Wiktionary (Wik). The PWN
synonymy network was built according to the fol-
lowing rule: an edge is drawn between any two
words that belong to the same synset. The Wik-
tionary synonymy network was extracted from Wik-
tionary dumps3 by methods exposed in (Sajous et
al., 2010). Each of these resources is split4 by parts
of speech (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives) resulting in
three different synonymy graphs, designated, for ex-
ample for the Robert dictionary, as follows: RobN ,
RobV , RobA.
2Synonymy relations from each of these dictionaries were
extracted by the INALF/ATILF Research Unit and corrected by
the CRISCO Research Unit.
3http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexiques/wiktionaryx.html
4Note that splitting is not necessary. The following work
would apply similarly to whole resources.
2.1 Invariants : similar structural properties
Most lexical networks, as most field networks5,
are Hierarchical Small World (HSW) Networks that
share similar properties (Watts and Strogatz, 1998;
Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Newman, 2003; Gaume
et al, 2010; Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005). They
exhibit a low density (not many edges), short paths
(the average number of edges L on the shortest
path between two vertices is low), a high clustering
rate C (locally densely connected subgraphs can be
found whereas the whole graph is globally sparse in
edges), and the distribution of their degrees follows
a power law. All graphs in our sample exhibit the
HSW properties. For example, Table 1 shows the
pedigrees of synonymy graphs of verbs(for space
reasons we only show results for verbs, results are
similar for the two other parts of speech). In this ta-
ble, n and m are the number of vertices and edges,
?k? is the average degree of vertices, and ? is the
coefficient of the power law that fits the distribution
of degrees, with a correlation coefficient r2. nlcc
and Llcc are the number of vertices and the aver-
age path length measured on the largest connected
component. Even if n and ?k? vary across dictionar-
ies, Llcc is always small, C is always higher than for
equivalent random graphs (Newman, 2003) and the
distribution of degrees remains close to a power law
with a good correlation coefficient.

2.2 Variability : a low agreement between
edges
Although all these graphs are HSW, Table 1 shows
that the lexical coverage (n) and the number of syn-
onymy links (m) significantly vary across graphs.
Given two graphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 =
5Field networks are networks that model real data gathered
by field work, for example in sociology, linguistics or biol-
ogy. They contrast with artificial networks (deterministic or
random).
16
(V2, E2), in order to compare their lexical cover-
ages, we compute the Recall (R?), Precision (P?)
and F-score (F?) of their vertex sets:
R?(G1, G2) =
|V1?V2|
|V2|
P?(G1, G2) =
|V1?V2|
|V1|
F?(G1, G2) = 2.
R?(G1,G2).P?(G1,G2)
R?(G1,G2)+P?(G1,G2)
F-scores of pairs of comparable graphs (same lan-

The value of F?(G1, G2) measures the relative
lexical coverage of G1 and G2 but does not eval-
uate the agreement between the synonymy judge-
ments modelled by the graphs? edges. The Kappa
of Cohen (Cohen, 1960) is a common measure of
agreement between different judges who categorize
the same set of objects. In the case of graphs, the
judgements are not applied to simple entities but to
relations between pairs of entities. Two synonymy
graphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) give two
judgements on pairs of vertices. For example, if a
pair (u, v) ? V1 ? V1 is judged as synonymous then
(u, v) ? E1, else (u, v) ? E1. To measure the
agreement between edges of G1 and G2, one first
has to reduce the two graphs to their common ver-
tices:
? G?1 =
(
V ? = (V1?V2), E?1 = E1? (V
??V ?)
)
;
? G?2 =
(
V ? = (V1?V2), E?2 = E2? (V
??V ?)
)
;
For each pair of vertices (a, b) ? (V ? ? V ?), four
cases are possible:
? (a, b) ? E?1
?
E?2: agreement on pair (a, b),
(a, b) is synonymous for G?1 and for G
?

? (a, b) ? E?1

(a, b) is neither synonymous forG?1 nor forG

The value of agreement on synonymy judgements
Kl(G

dictionary pairs of our sample, however it remains
quite low. For example: Kl(Rob

and Kl(PWN
?

?
V ) = 0.247 (cf. Table 3). On
the whole sample studied in this work this agreement
value ranges from 0.25 to 0.63 averaging to 0.39.
This shows that, although standard dictionaries of
synonyms show similar structural properties, they
considerably disagree on which pairs of words are
synonymous.
6Here, we do not consider reflexivity edges, that link ver-
tices to themselves, as they are obviously in agreement across
graphs and are not informative synonymy judgements.

3 Analysis of the disagreement between
synonymy networks
When comparing two lexical resources built by lexi-
cographers, one can be surprised to find such a level
of disagreement on synonymy relations. This diver-
gence in judgements can be explained by editorial
policies and choices (regarding, for example printed
size constraints, targeted audiences...). Furthermore,
lexicographers also have their subjectivity. Since
synonymy is more a continuous gradient than a dis-
crete choice (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002), an alterna-
tive limited to synonym/not synonym leaves ample
room for subjective interpretation. However, these
justifications do not account for such discrepancies
between resources describing the semantic relations
of words of the same language. Therefore, we ex-
pect that, if two words are deemed not synonyms
in one resource G1, but synonyms in another G2,
they will nevertheless share many neighbours in G1
and G2. In other words they will belong to the same
dense zones. Consequently the dense zones (or clus-
ters) found in G1 will be similar to those found in
G2. Random walks are an efficient way to reveal
these dense zones (Gaume et al, 2010). So, to eval-
uate the hypothesis, let us begin by studying the sim-
ilarity of random walks on various synonymy net-
works.
3.1 Random walks on synonymy networks
If G = (V,E) is a reflexive and undirected graph,
let us define dG(u) = |{v ? V/(u, v) ? E}| the
degree of vertex u in graph G, and let us imagine a
walker wandering on the graph G:
? At a time t ? N, the walker is on one vertex
u ? V ;
? At time t + 1, the walker can reach any neigh-
bouring vertex of u, with uniform probability.
This process is called a simple random walk (Bol-
lobas, 2002). It can be defined by a Markov chain
on V with a n? n transition matrix [G]:
[G] = (gu,v)u,v?V
with gu,v =
?
?
?
1
dG(u)
if (u, v) ? E,
0 else.
Since G is reflexive, each vertex has at least one
neighbour (itself) thus [G] is well defined. Further-
more, by construction, [G] is a stochastic matrix:
?u ? V,
?
v?V gu,v = 1.
The probability P tG(u v) of a walker starting on
vertex u to reach a vertex v after t steps is:
P tG(u v) = ([G]
t)u,v (4)
One can then prove (Gaume, 2004), with the
Perron-Frobenius theorem (Stewart, 1994), that if G
is connected8 (i.e. there is always at least one path
between any two vertices), reflexive and undirected,
then ?u, v ? V :
lim
t??
P tG(u v) = limt??
([G]t)u,v =
dG(v)
?
x?V dG(x)
(5)
It means that when t tends to infinity, the probability
of being on a vertex v at time t does not depend on
the starting vertex but only on the degree of v. In the
following we will refer to this limit as piG(v).
3.2 Confluence in synonymy networks
The dynamics of the convergence of random walks
towards the limit (Eq. (5)) is heavily dependent on
the starting node. Indeed, the trajectory of the ran-
dom walker is completely governed by the topology
of the graph: after t steps, any vertex v located at a
distance of t links or less can be reached. The prob-
ability of this event depends on the number of paths
between u and v, and on the structure of the graph
around the intermediary vertices along those paths.
The more interconnections between the vertices, the
higher the probability of reaching v from u.
For example, if we take G1 = RobV and
G2 = LarV , and choose the three vertices
u = ?plucher (peel), r = d?pecer (tear apart) and
s = sonner (ring), which are such that:
? u= ?plucher (peel) and r= d?pecer (tear apart)
are synonymous in RobV : (u, r) ? E1;
? u= ?plucher (peel) and r= d?pecer (tear apart)
are not synonymous in LarV : (u, r) /? E2;
? r= d?pecer (tear apart) and s= sonner (ring)
have the same number of synonyms in G1 :
dG1(r) = dG1(s) = d1;
8The graph needs to be connected for Eq. 5 to be valid but,
in practice, the work presented here also holds on disconnected
graphs.
18
? r= d?pecer (tear apart) and s= sonner (ring)
have the same number of synonyms in G2 :
dG2(r) = dG2(s) = d2.
Then Equation (5) states that (P tG1(u r))1?t and
(P tG1(u s))1?t converge to the same limit:
piG1(r) = piG1(s) =
d1
?
x?V1
dG1(x)
as do (P tG2(u r))1?t and (P
t
G2(u s))1?t:
piG2(r) = piG2(s) =
d2
?
x?V2
dG2(x)
However the two series do not converge with the
same dynamics. At the beginning of the walk, for t
small, one can expect that P tG1(u r) > P
t
G1(u s)
and P tG2(u r) > P
t
G2(u s) because ?plucher is
semantically closer to d?pecer than to sonner. In-
deed the number of short paths between ?plucher
and d?pecer is much greater than between ?plucher
and sonner.
Figure 1(a) shows the values of P tG1(u r)
and P tG1(u s) versus t, and compares them
to their common limit. Figure 1(b) shows
the values of P tG2(u r) and P
t
G2(u s) ver-
sus t, and compares them to their common limit.
These figures confirm our intuition that, since
?plucher (peel) and d?pecer (tear apart) are seman-
tically close, P tG1(u r) and P
t
G2(u r) decrease to
their limit. We call this phenomenon strong con-
fluence. It is worth noting that this remains true
even if ?plucher (peel) and d?pecer (tear apart)
are not synonyms in LarV . Conversely, since
?plucher (peel) and sonner (ring) are semantically
distant, P tG1(u s) and P
t
G2(u s) increase to their
asymptotic value. We call this phenomenon weak
confluence.
3.3 Correlation of the confluence of
disagreeing synonymy pairs
When two graphs G1 and G2 disagree on a pair of
vertices (a, b) (a is a neighbour of b in one graph but
not in the other) there are three possible cases for the
strength of the confluence between vertices a and b:
(1) strong in both graphs (confluence agreement),

in RobV and LarV .
(2) weak in both graphs (confluence agreement),
(3) strong in one graph, but weak in the other (con-
fluence disagreement).
To contrast cases (1) and (2) from case (3) we
measure the correlation between the confluences of
disagreeing pairs of two synonymy networks G?1
and G?2. We compare it to this same correlation on
two reflexive and undirected random graphs RG?1 =
(V ?, ER1 ) and RG?2 = (V
?, ER2 ) built such that:
|ER1 ? E
R
2 | = |E
?
1 ? E
?
2|,
|ER1 ? E
R
2 | = |E
?
1 ? E
?
2|,
|ER1 ? E
R
2 | = |E
?
1 ? E
?
2|,
19
which means that the Kappa agreement between
RG?1 and RG?2 is the same as between G
?
1 and G
?
2.
For a given t > 1 and a set of vertex pairs X ?
V ??V ?, the correlation of confluences ?X(G?1, G
?
2)
is defined by the Pearson?s linear correlation coef-
ficient of the two value tables
(
P tG?1
(u v)
)
(u,v)?X
and
(
P tG?2
(u v)
)
(u,v)?X .
For all comparable pairs of our sample, we
see that disagreeing pairs tend to have a much
higher correlation of confluence than disagreeing
pairs of equivalent random networks. As an ex-
ample, for G1 = RobV , G2 = LarV and
t = 3, we have ?E?1
T
E?2
(G?1, G
?
2) = 0.41 and
?E?1
T
E?2
(G?1, G
?
2) = 0.38, whereas in the case of
the equivalent random graphs the same figures are
close to zero.
This suggests that even if graphs disagree on the
synonymy of a significant number of pairs, they nev-
ertheless generally agree on the strength of their
confluence. In other words, occurrences of cases (1)
and (2) are the majority whereas occurrences of case
(3) are rare. We propose in the next section an exper-
iment to verify if we can rely on confluence to find a
greater agreement between two graphs that disagree
at the level of synonymy links.
4 Self mediated agreement by confluence
4.1 Hypothesis: Conciliation reveals structural
similarity beyond disagreement of local
synonymy
We saw in section 2.2 that the rate of agreement be-
tween edges of two standard synonymy networksG?1
and G?2, Kl(G
?
1, G
?
2), is usually low. However, we
have noticed in Section 3.3 that the confluences of
pairs on which synonymy graphs disagree are sig-
nificantly more correlated (? ? 0.4) than the conflu-
ence of equivalent random networks (? ? 0). This
suggests the following hypothesis: synonymy net-
works are in agreement at a level that is not taken
into account by the Kappa measure on edges.
To verify this hypothesis, we try to make each pair
of graphs conciliate on the basis of confluence val-
ues. We propose a conciliation process by which
a graph can accept the addition of another?s edges
if they do not contradict its structure (i.e. there
is a strong confluence value). We then assess if a
strong agreement is found between the two resulting
graphs.
Let G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) be two
synonymy networks, both reflexive, undirected, con-
nected, and a given t ? N?. We define:
? G?1 =
(
V ? = (V1 ?V2), E?1 = E1 ? (V
??V ?)
)
? G?2 =
(
V ? = (V1 ?V2), E?2 = E2 ? (V
??V ?)
)
? G(+G2)1 = (V
?, E+1 = E
?
1 ? C1) where
C1 =
n
(u, r) ? E?1 ? E
?
2
?
P tG?1
(u r) > piG?1 (r)
o
(6)
? G(+G1)2 = (V
?, E+2 = E
?
2 ? C2) where
C2 =
n
(u, r) ? E?1 ? E
?
2
?
P tG?2
(u r) > piG?2 (r)
o
(7)
G(+G2)1 and G
(+G1)
2 are called accommodating
graphs. The construction of the accommodating
graphs may be metaphorically understood as a con-
ciliation protocol by which two graphs accept pro-
posals of the other that they can reconsider. For ex-
ample, G(+G2)1 is the graph G
?
1 enriched by edges
(u, r) of G?2 such that there is a strong confluence
between vertices u and r in G?1
The following property is worth noticing:
Proposition 1. ?t ? N? :
(E?1 ? E
?
2) ? (E
+
1 ? E
+
2 ) ? (E
?
1 ? E
?
2) (8)
Proof. By definition, E+1 = E
?
1 ? C1 and E
+
2 =
E?2?C2, thus (E
?
1?E
?
2) ? (E
+

+
2 ), furthermore,
by definition, C1 ? E?1?E
?

?
1?E
?
2 thus
(E+1 ? E
+
2 ) ? (E
?
1 ? E
?
2).
4.2 Experimental protocol
If, for any (G1, G2) synonymy resources of the
same language, Kl(G
(+G2)
1 , G
(+G1)
2 ) is signifi-
cantly greater than Kl(G
?
1, G
?
2), then the hypothe-
sis is verified. The conciliation process depends on
confluence measures that depend on a given t, the
number of steps of the random walk. For t = 1,
only vertices in the neighbourhood of the starting
vertex are reachable. Consequently only pairs of
vertices that are edges have a non null confluence.
Thus Kl(G
(+G2)
1 , G
(+G1)
2 ) = Kl(G
?
1, G
?
2) which
does not help us to contrast conciliated graphs from
20
initial binary synonymy graphs. So we fix t = 2
the shortest walk length that still yields informative
results.
We propose a control experiment that consists
in applying the conciliation process to random net-
works that have the same Kappa as the pairs of syn-
onymy networks. The construction of these random
graphs is described above, in section 3.3. We mea-
sure the agreement after conciliation of 20 different
random graphs. With this control experiment we as-
sess that the observed results are specific to graphs
describing the same resource, and not a mere bias of
the protocol (let us imagine a protocol whereby one
would add all the disagreeing edges to the graphs:
not only the Kappa of the pseudo accommodating
synonymy graphs would be equal to one, but also the
Kappa of pseudo accommodating random graphs,
which would disqualify the protocol).
4.3 Results
Table 3 summarizes Kappa and conciliated Kappa
values on the pairs of synonymy graphs of verbs.
It shows a significant improvement of agreement
after conciliation. For example, from a moder-
ate Kappa (0.518) between graphs Rob?V and Lar
?
V
(constructed by experts), the conciliation process
leads to an excellent Kappa (0.852). Conversely the
random networks only increase their agreement by
0.01 (with a very low standard deviation ? < 0.001).
In English, from a poor (0.247) Kappa between
PWN ?V (constructed by experts) and Wik
?
V (con-
structed by the ?crowds?), the conciliation process
leads to a moderate Kappa (0.530), whereas the ran-
dom networks only marginally increase their agree-
ment (0.004).
Results are similar for other parts of speech. This
means that the conciliation process significantly im-
proves the agreement between resources, even if
they are originally significantly diverge.
It is interesting to notice that the most sim-
ilar pairs in terms of edge agreement do not
necessarily produce the most agreeing pairs
of accommodating graphs. For example, the
pair(BaiV , RobV ) agrees more than the pair
(BaiV , LarV ), whereas for their accommodating
graphs, the pair(Bai(+RobV )V , Rob
(+BaiV )
V ) agrees
less than the pair (Bai(+LarV )V , Lar
(+BaiV )
V ).

So, when G1 and G2 are two synonymy graphs
of a given language, then they are able to address
their local synonymy disagreement and to reach a
significantly better agreement. On the other hand,
the agreement of random networks does not really
improve after conciliation. This proves that the syn-
onymy networks of the same language share specific
similar structures that can be detected with the help
of confluence measures.
5 Conclusion
Although graphs that encode synonymy judgements
of standard semantic lexical resources share simi-
lar HSW properties they diverge on their synonymy
judgements as measured by a low Kappa of edges.
So, one could wonder whether the notion of syn-
onymy is well defined, or if synonymy judgements
are really independent. Without directly address-
ing this question, we nevertheless have shown that
strong confluence measures help two synonymy
graphs accommodate each others? conflicting edges.
They reach a much better agreement, whereas ran-
dom graphs? divergence is maintained. Since the
graphs are HSW, they draw clusters of synonyms
in which pairs of vertices have a strong confluence.
21
This suggests two conclusions. First, different syn-
onymy resources that describe the same lexicon re-
veal dense zones that are much more similar across
graphs than the binary synonymy categorisation (the
synonym/not synonym alternative). These dense
zones convey information about the semantic organ-
isation of the lexicon. Second, random walks and
confluence measures seem an appropriate technique
to detect and compare the dense zones of various
synonymy graphs.
This theoretical work validates the random
walk/confluence approach as a potentially valid tool
for detecting semantic similarities. This opens many
perspectives for applications. For example, it can
be used to enrich resources as was done for the
Wisigoth project (Sajous et al, 2010). It may also
help to merge, or aggregate, resources. If we apply
the conciliation process to two graphs G1 and G2,
obtaining two accommodating graphs G(+G2)1 =
(V ?, E+1 )) and G
(+G1)
2 = (V
?, E+2 )) then the graph
G = (V ?, E?? = (E+1 ? E
+
2 )) could be a merged
resource. Indeed, G?s set of edges, E?? seems like
a good compromise because, according to the prop-
erty 1, (E?1 ? E
?
2) ? E
?? ? (E?1 ? E
?
2). This new
aggregation method would need to be validated by
comparing the quality of the merged resource to the
results of the union or intersection.
Furthermore, this work is a first step for defin-
ing a similarity measure between graphs, that could
take into account the structural agreement rather
than a simple edge-to-edge disagreement. Subse-
quent work should generalise the conciliation pro-
cess along several axes:
? The number of steps t was chosen as the short-
est possible for the confluence measures. It
would be worthwhile to investigate the effect
of the length of the walks on the agreement of
the accommodating graphs.
? Another line of research would be to alter the
conciliation ability of graphs, by increasing or
decreasing the criterion for strong confluence.
One can for example introduce a k parameter in
the definition of C1 (resp. C2), in Equation 6:
P tG?1(u r) > k.piG
?
1
(r) (9)
? The conciliation process seems unbalanced in-
sofar as graphs only accept to add edges. It
should be extended to a negotiating process
where a graph could also accept to remove one
edge if the other does not have it and its conflu-
ence is weak.
? The conciliation process could also be gen-
eralised to graphs that have different vertices,
such as two synonymy networks of different
languages. In that case the issue is not anymore
to reveal a deeper similarity, beyond a local
disagreement, because one can not compare
the graphs vertex by vertex or edge by edge.
However, questioning whether the semantic
structures revealed by dense zones are similar
from one lexicon to another is an interesting
line of research. One approach to compare two
synonymy graphs of two different languages
would be to draw edges between vertices that
are translations of each other. Random walks
could then reach vertices of the two lexicons,
so that the conciliation process could be
generalised to accommodating two synonymy
graphs via translation links.
