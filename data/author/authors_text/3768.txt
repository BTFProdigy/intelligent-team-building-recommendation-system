This paper reports on an evaluation performed 
on the Grammar Checker for Norwegian 
(NGC), developed at The Text Laboratory, 
University of Oslo.1 The ability of the NGC to 
find errors made by different ?non-standard? 
linguistic groups is analysed and compared to 
its performance when tested on texts written 
by ?standard? users. Then possible ways of 
adapting the NGC for use on deviant language 
input are discussed.
