Abstract
Domain adaptation has been popularly stud-
ied on exploiting labeled information from a
source domain to learn a prediction model in
a target domain. In this paper, we develop a
novel representation learning approach to ad-
dress domain adaptation for text classification
with automatically induced discriminative la-
tent features, which are generalizable across
domains while informative to the prediction
task. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent
variables to conduct supervised word cluster-
ing on labeled documents from both source
and target domains, and then use the produced
cluster distribution of each word as its la-
tent feature representation for domain adapta-
tion. We train this latent graphical model us-
ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. We empirically evaluate the pro-
posed method with both cross-domain doc-
ument categorization tasks on Reuters-21578
dataset and cross-domain sentiment classifica-
tion tasks on Amazon product review dataset.
The experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed approach achieves superior perfor-
mance compared with alternative methods.
1 Introduction
Supervised prediction models typically require a
large amount of labeled data for training. However,
manually collecting data annotations is expensive in
many real-world applications such as document cat-
egorization or sentiment classification. Recently, do-
main adaptation has been proposed to exploit exist-
ing labeled data in a related source domain to assist
the prediction model training in the target domain
(Ben-David et al, 2006; Blitzer et al, 2006; Daume?
III, 2007; Blitzer et al, 2011; Chen et al, 2012). As
an effective tool to reduce annotation effort, domain
adaptation has achieved success in various cross-
domain natural language processing (NLP) systems
such as document categorization (Dai et al, 2007),
sentiment classification (Blitzer et al, 2007; Chen
et al, 2012; Mejova and Srinivasan, 2012; Chen
et al, 2011), email spam detection (Jiang and Zhai,
2007), and a number of other NLP tasks (Blitzer
et al, 2011; Daume? III, 2007).
One primary challenge of domain adaptation lies
in the distribution divergence of the two domains
in the original feature representation space. For ex-
ample, documents about books may contain very
different high-frequency words and discriminative
words from documents about kitchen. A good cross-
domain feature representation thus has been viewed
as critical for bridging the domain divergence gap
and facilitating domain adaptation in the NLP area
(Ben-David et al, 2006, 2010). Many domain adap-
tation works have been proposed to learn new
cross-domain feature representations (Blitzer et al,
2006, 2011). Though demonstrated good perfor-
mance on certain problems, these works mostly in-
duce new feature representations in an unsupervised
way, without taking the valuable label information
into account.
In this work, we present a novel supervised rep-
resentation learning approach to discover a latent
representation of words which is not only general-
izable across domains but also informative to the
classification task. Specifically, we propose a hier-
152
archical multinomial Naive Bayes model with la-
tent word cluster variables to perform supervised
word clustering on labeled documents from both do-
mains. Our model directly models the relationships
between the observed document label variables and
the latent word cluster variables. The induced clus-
ter representation of each word thus will be infor-
mative for the classification labels, and hence dis-
criminative for the target classification task. We train
this directed graphical model using an expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm, which maximizes the
log-likelihood of the observations of labeled docu-
ments. The induced cluster distribution of each word
can then be used as its generalizable representa-
tion to construct new cluster-based representation of
each document. For domain adaptation, we train a
supervised learning system with labeled data from
both domains in the new representation space and
apply it to categorize test documents in the target do-
main. In order to evaluate the proposed technique,
we conduct extensive experiments on the Reuters-
21578 dataset for cross-domain document catego-
rization and on Amazon product review dataset for
cross-domain sentiment classification. The experi-
mental results show the proposed approach can pro-
duce more effective representations than the com-
parison domain adaptation methods.
2 Related Work
Domain adaptation has recently been popularly
studied in natural language processing and a variety
of domain adaptation approaches have been devel-
oped, including instance weighting adaptation meth-
ods and feature representation learning methods.
Instance weighting adaptation methods improve
the transferability of a prediction model by training
an instance weighted learning system. Much work in
this category has been developed to address differ-
ent weighting schemas (Sugiyama et al, 2007; Wan
et al, 2011). Jiang and Zhai (2007) applied instance
weighting algorithms to tackle cross-domain NLP
tasks and proposed to remove misleading source
training data and assign less weights to labeled data
from the source domain than labeled data from the
target domain. Dai et al (2007) proposed to increase
the weights of mistakenly predicted instances from
the target domain and decrease the weights of incor-
rectly predicted instances from the source domain
during an iterative training process.
Representation learning methods bridge do-
main divergence either by differentiating domain-
invariant features from domain-specific features
(Daume? III, 2007; Daume? III et al, 2010; Blitzer
et al, 2011; Finkel and Manning, 2009) or seeking
generalizable latent features across domains (Blitzer
et al, 2006, 2007; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).
Daume? III (2007); Daume? III et al (2010) proposed
a simple heuristic feature replication method to rep-
resent common, source specific and target specific
features. Finkel and Manning (2009) proposed a for-
mer version of it based on the use of a hierarchi-
cal Bayesian prior. Blitzer et al (2011) proposed
a coupled subspace learning method, which learns
two projectors, one for each domain, to project the
original features into domain-sharing and domain-
specific features. Blitzer et al (2006) proposed a
structural correspondence learning (SCL) method to
model the correlation between pivot features and
non-pivot features. It uses the correlation to in-
duce latent domain-invariant features as augment-
ing features for supervised learning. Extensions of
this work include improving pivot feature selection
(Blitzer et al, 2007; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010),
and improving the correlation modeling between
pivot and non-pivot features (Tan, 2009).
The proposed approach in this paper belongs to
representation learning methods. However, unlike
the unsupervised representation learning methods
reviewed above, our proposed approach learns gen-
eralizable feature representations of words by ex-
ploiting data labels from the two domains.
3 Learning Latent Word Representations
using Supervised Word Clustering
In this paper, we address domain adaptation for
text classification. Given a source domain DS with
plenty of labeled documents, and a target domain
DT with a very few labeled documents, the task is
to learn a classifier from the labeled documents in
both domains, and use it to classify the unlabeled
documents in the target domain. The documents in
the two domains share the same universal vocabu-
lary V = {w1, w2, ? ? ? , wn}, but the word distri-
butions in the two domains are typically different.
153
Therefore, training the classification model directly
from the original word feature space V may not gen-
eralize well in the target domain.
We propose to address this problem by first learn-
ing a supervised mapping function ? : V ?? Z
from the labeled documents in both domains, which
maps the input word features in the large vocabu-
lary set V into a low dimensional latent feature space
Z . By filtering out unimportant details and noises,
we expect the low dimensional mapping can cap-
ture the intrinsic structure of the input data that is
discriminative for the classification task and gener-
alizable across domains. In particular, we learn such
a mapping function by conducting supervised word
clustering on the labeled documents using a hierar-
chical multinomial Naive Bayes model. Below, we
will first introduce this supervised word clustering
model and then use the mapping function produced
to transform documents in different domains into the
same low-dimensional space for training cross do-
main text classification systems.
3.1 Supervised Word Clustering
Given all labeled documents from the source and
target domains, D = {(wt, yt)}Tt=1, where the t-th
labeled document is expressed as a bag of words,
wt = {wt1, wt2, ? ? ? , wtNt}, and its label value is
yt ? Y for Y = {1, ? ? ? ,K}, we propose to per-
form supervised word clustering by modeling the
document-label pair distribution using a hierarchical
multinomial Naive Bayes model given in Figure 1,
which has a middle layer of latent cluster variables.
In this plate model, the variable Yt denotes the
observed class label for the t-th document, and all
the label variables, {Yt}Tt=1, share the same multi-
nomial distribution ?Y across documents. The la-
tent variable Ct,i denotes the cluster membership
of the word Wt,i, and all the cluster variables,
{Ct,i}T,Ntt=1,i=1, share the same set of conditional dis-
tributions {?C|y}Ky=1 across documents and words.
The variable Wt,i denotes the i-th observed word
in the t-th document, and all the word variables,
{Wt,i}T,Ntt=1,i=1, share the same set of conditional dis-
tributions {?W |c}mc=1. Here we assume the number
of word clusters is m. For simplicity, we do not show
the distribution parameter variables in the Figure.
Following the Markov property of directed graph-
Figure 1: Supervised word clustering model.
ical models, we can see that given the cluster vari-
able values, the document label variables will be
completely independent of the word variables. By
learning this latent directed graphical model, we
thus expect the important classification information
expressed in the input observation words can be
effectively summarized into the latent cluster vari-
ables. This latent model is much simpler than the
supervised topic models (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007),
but we will show later that it can suitably produce a
generalizable feature mapping function for domain
adaptation.
To train the latent graphical model in Fig-
ure 1 on labeled documents D, we use a standard
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Demp-
ster et al, 1977) to maximize the marginal log-
likelihood of the observations:
LL(D;?) =
?
t
logP (yt,wt|?) (1)
The EM algorithm is an iterative procedure. In each
iteration, it takes an alternative E-step and M-step
to maximize the lower bound of the marginal log-
likelihood function. In our experiments, we start
from a random initialization of the model parame-
ters and the latent variable values, and then perform
iterative EM updates until converge to a local opti-
mal solution.
3.2 Induced Word Representation
After training the supervised clustering model using
EM algorithm, a set of local optimal model parame-
ters ?? will be returned, which define a joint distri-
bution over the three groups of variables in the di-
rected graphical model. Next we define a supervised
latent feature mapping function ? from this trained
154
model to map each word w in the vocabulary V into
a conditional distribution vector over the word clus-
ter variable, such as
?(w)=[P (c=1|w,??), ? ? ? , P (c=m|w,??)]. (2)
The conditional distributions involved in this map-
ping function can be computed as
P (c|w,??)=
?
y?YP (w|c,??)P (c|y,??)P (y|??)
P (w)
(3)
where P (w|c,??) = ??w|c P (c|y,??) = ??c|y and
P (y|??) = ??y can be determined from the model
parameters directly, and p(w) can be computed as
the empirical frequency of word w among all the
other words in all the training documents.
We then define a transformation matrix ? ?
Rn?m based on the mapping function ? defined in
Eq. (2), such that ?i: = ?(wi) where wi is the i-th
word in the vocabulary V . That is, each row of ?
is the induced representation vector for one word. ?
can be viewed as a soft word clustering matrix, and
?i,j denotes the probability of word wi belongs to
the j-th cluster. Given the original document-word
frequency matrix Xtr ? RT?n for the labeled train-
ing documents from the two domains, we can con-
struct its representations Ztr ? RT?m in the pre-
dictive latent clustering space by performing the fol-
lowing transformation:
Ztr = Xtr?. (4)
Similarly, we can construct the new representation
matrix Zts for the test data Xts in the target domain.
We then train a classification model on the labeled
data Ztr and apply it to classify the test data Zts.
4 Experiments
We evaluate the proposed approach with experi-
ments on cross domain document categorization of
Reuters data and cross domain sentiment classifi-
cation of Amazon product reviews, comparing to a
number of baseline and existing domain adaptation
methods. In this section, we report the experimental
setting and results on these two data sets.
4.1 Approaches
We compared our proposed supervised word cluster-
ing approach (SWC) with the following five compar-
ison methods for domain adaptation:
(1) BOW: This is a bag-of-word baseline method,
which trains a SVM classifier with labeled data
from both domains using the original bag-of-
word features.
(2) PLSA: This is an unsupervised word clustering
method, which first applies the probabilistic la-
tent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999)
to obtain word clusterings with both labeled and
unlabeled data from the two domains and then
uses the soft word clusterings as augmenting
features to train SVM classifiers.
(3) FDLDA: This is an alternative supervised word
clustering method we built by training the
Fast-Discriminative Latent Dirichlet Allocation
model (Shan et al, 2009) with all labeled data
from the two domains. After training the model,
we used the learned topic distribution p(z) and
the conditional word distributions p(w|z) to
compute the conditional distribution over topics
p(z|w) for each word as the soft clustering of the
word. We then used the soft word clusterings as
augmenting features to train SVM classifiers.
(4) SCL: This is the structural correspondence
learning based domain adaptation method
(Blitzer et al, 2006). It first induces generaliz-
able features with all data from both domains
by modeling the correlations between pivot fea-
tures and non-pivot features, and then uses the
produced generalizable features as augmenting
features to train SVM classifiers.
(5) CPSP: This is coupled subspace learning based
domain adaptation method (Blitzer et al, 2011).
It first learns two domain projectors using all
data from the two domains by approximating
multi-view dimensionality reduction, and then
projects the labeled data to low dimensional la-
tent feature space to train SVM Classifiers.
We used the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin,
2011) with its default parameter setting to train lin-
ear SVM classifiers as the base classification model
for all comparison methods.

4.2 Experiments on Reuters Data Set
We used the popularly studied Reuters-21578
dataset (Dai et al, 2007), which contains three cross-
domain document categorization tasks, Orgs vs Peo-
ple, Orgs vs Places, People vs Places. The source
and target domains of each task contain documents
sampled from different non-overlapping subcate-
gories. From example, the task of Orgs vs People
assigns a document into one of the two top cate-
gories (Orgs, People), and the source domain doc-
uments and the target domain documents are sam-
pled from different subcategories of Orgs and Peo-
ple. There are 1237 source documents and 1208 tar-
get documents for the task of Orgs vs People, 1016
source documents and 1043 target documents for the
task of Orgs vs Places, and 1077 source documents
and 1077 target documents for the task ofPeople vs
Places. For each task, we built a unigram vocabulary
based on all the documents from the two domains
and represented each document as a feature vector
containing term frequency values.
4.2.1 Experimental Results for Cross-Domain
Document Categorization
For each of the three cross-domain document cat-
egorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset, we used
all the source documents as labeled training data
while randomly selecting 100 target documents as
labeled training data and setting the rest as unla-
beled test data. For the BOW baseline method, we
used the term-frequency features. The other five ap-
proaches are based on representation learning, and
we selected the dimension size of the representation
learning, i.e., the cluster number in our proposed ap-
proach, from {5, 10, 20, 50, 100} according to the
average classification results over 3 runs on the task
of Orgs vs People. The dimension sizes of the in-
duced representations for the five approaches, PLSA,
FDLDA, SCL, CPSP and SWC are 20, 20, 100, 100
and 20 respectively.
We then repeated each experiment 10 times on
each task with different random selections of the 100
labeled target documents to compare the six compar-
ison approaches. The average classification results
in terms of accuracy and standard deviations are re-
ported in Table 1. We can see that by simply combin-
ing labeled documents from the two domains with-
out adaptation, the BOW method performs poorly
across the three tasks. The PLSA method outper-
forms the BOW method over all the three tasks with
small improvements. The supervised word cluster-
ing method FDLDA, though performing slightly bet-
ter than the unsupervised clustering method PLSA,
produces poor performance comparing to the pro-
posed SWC method. One possible reason is that
the FDLDA model is not specialized for supervised
word clustering, and it uses a logistic regression
model to predict the labels from the word topics,
while the final soft word clustering is computed from
the learned distribution p(z) and p(w|z). That is,
in the FDLDA model the labels only influence the
word clusterings indirectly and hence its influence
can be much smaller than the influence of labels as
direct parent variables of the word cluster variables
in the SWC model. The two domain adaptation ap-
proaches, SCL and CPSP, both produce significant
improvements over BOW, PLSA and FDLDA on the
two tasks of Orgs vs People and Orgs vs Places,
while the CPSP method produces slightly inferior
performance than PLSA and FDLDA on the task of
People vs Places. The proposed method SWC on
the other hand consistently and significantly outper-
forms all the other comparison methods across all
the three tasks.
We also studied the sensitivity of the proposed
approach with respect to the number of clusters,

i.e., the dimension size of the learned representa-
tion. We experimented with a set of different val-
ues m ? {5, 10, 20, 50, 100} as the number of clus-
ters. For each m value, we used the same experimen-
tal setting as above and repeated the experiments 10
times to obtain the average comparison results. The
classification accuracy results on the three tasks are
reported in Figure 2. We can see that the proposed
method is not very sensitive to the number of clus-
ters, across the set of increasing values we consid-
ered, and its performance becomes very stable after
the cluster number reaches 20.
4.2.2 Document Categorization Accuracy vs
Label Complexity in Target Domain
We next conducted experiments to compare the
six approaches by varying the amount of the labeled
data from the target domain. We tested a set of dif-
ferent values, s ? {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}, as the
number of labeled documents from the target do-
main. For each different s value, we repeated the ex-
periments 10 times by randomly selecting s labeled
documents from the target domain using the same
experimental setting as before. The comparison re-
sults across the set of s values are plotted in Fig-
ure 3. We can see that in general the performance of
each method improves with the increase of the num-
ber of labeled documents from the target domain.
The proposed method SWC and the domain adapta-
tion method SCL clearly outperform the other four
methods. Moreover, the proposed method SWC not
only maintains consistent and significant advantages
over all other methods across the range of differ-
ent s values, its performance with 300 labeled tar-
get instances is even superior to the other methods
with 500 labeled target instances. All these results
suggest the proposed approach is very effective for
adapting data across domains.
4.3 Experiments on Amazon Product Reviews
We conducted cross-domain sentiment classification
on the widely used Amazon product reviews (Blitzer
et al, 2007), which contains review documents dis-
tributed in four categories: Books(B), DVD(D), Elec-
tronics(E) and Kitchen(K). Each category contains
1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. We con-
structed 12 cross-domain sentiment classification
tasks, one for each source-target domain pair, B2D,
B2E, B2K, D2B, D2E, D2K, E2B, E2D, E2K, K2B,
K2D, K2E. For example, the task B2D means that
we use the Books reviews as the source domain and
the DVD reviews as the target domain. For each pair
of domains, we built a vocabulary with both uni-
gram and bigram features extracted from all the doc-
uments of the two domains, and then represented
each review document as a feature vector with term
frequency values.
4.3.1 Experimental Results for Cross-Domain
Sentiment Classification
For each of the twelve cross-domain sentiment
classification tasks on Amazon product reviews, we
used all the source reviews as labeled data and ran-
domly selected 100 target reviews as labeled data
while treating the rest as unlabeled test data. For the
baseline method BOW, we used binary indicator val-
ues as features, which has been shown to work better
than the term-frequency features for sentiment clas-
sification tasks (Pang et al, 2002; Na et al, 2004).
For all the other representation learning based meth-
ods, we selected the dimension size of learned repre-
sentation according to the average results over 3 runs
on the B2D task. The dimension sizes selected for
the methods PLSA, FDLDA, SCL, CPSP, and SWC
are 10, 50, 50, 100 and 10, respectively.1
150 and 100 are also the suggested values for SCL (Blitzer
et al, 2007) and CPSP (Blitzer et al, 2011) respectively on this
cross-domain sentiment classification dataset.

We then repeated each experiment 10 times based
on different random selections of 100 labeled re-
views from the target domain to compare the six
methods on the twelve tasks. The average classifica-
tion results are reported in Table 2. We can see that
the PLSA and FDLDA methods do not show much
advantage over the baseline method BOW. CPSP
performs better than PLSA and BOW on many of
the twelve tasks, but with small advantages, while
SCL outperforms CPSP on most tasks. The proposed
method SWC however demonstrates a clear advan-
tage over all the other methods and produces the best
results on all the twelve tasks.
We also conducted sensitivity analysis over the
proposed approach regarding the number of clus-
ters on the twelve cross-domain sentiment classifi-
cation tasks, by testing a set of cluster number val-
ues m = {5, 10, 20, 50, 100}. The average results
are plotted in Figure 5. Similar as before, we can
see the proposed approach has stable performance
across the set of different cluster numbers. More-
over, these results also clearly show that domain
adaptation is not a symmetric process, as we can see
it is easier to conduct domain adaptation from the
source domain Books to the target domain Kitchen
(with an accuracy around 82%), but it is more diffi-
cult to make domain adaptation from the source do-
main Kitchen to the target domain Books (with an ac-

curacy around 75%). It also shows that the degree of
relatedness of the two domains is an important factor
for the effectiveness of knowledge adaptation. For
example, one can see that it is much easier to con-
duct domain adaptation from Kitchen to Electronics
(with an accuracy around 84%) than from Kitchen to
Books (with an accuracy around 75%), as Kitchen is
more closely related to Electronics than Books.
4.3.2 Sentiment Classification Accuracy vs
Label Complexity in Target Domain
Similar as before, we tested the proposed ap-
proach using a set of different values s ?
{100, 200, 300, 400, 500} as the number of labeled
reviews from the target domain. For each given s
value, we conducted the comparison experiments us-
ing the same setting above. The average results are
reported in Figure 4. We can see that the perfor-
mance of each approach in general improves with
the increase of the number of labeled reviews from
the target domain. The proposed approach maintains
a clear advantage over all the other methods on all
the twelve tasks across different label complexities.
All those empirical results demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach for cross-domain
sentiment classification.
4.3.3 Illustration of the Word Clusters
Finally, we would also like to demonstrate the
hard word clusters produced by the proposed su-
pervised word clustering method. We assign a word
into the cluster it most likely belongs to according
to its soft clustering representation, such as c? =
argmaxc P (c|w,??). Table 3 presents the top repre-
sentative words (i.e., the most frequent words) of the
10 word clusters produced on the task of B2K. We
can see that the first three clusters (C1, C2, and C3)
contain words with positive sentiment polarity in
different degrees. The two clusters (C4 and C5) con-
tain words used to express the degree of opinions.
The next four clusters (C6, C7, C8, and C9) contain
content words related to Books or Kitchen. The last
cluster (C10) contains words of negative sentiment
polarity. These results demonstrate that the proposed
supervised word clustering can produce task mean-
ingful word clusters and hence label-informative la-
tent features, which justifies its effectiveness.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel supervised rep-
resentation learning method to tackle domain adap-
tation by inducing predictive latent features based
on supervised word clustering. With the soft word
clustering produced, we can transform all docu-
ments from the two domains into a unified low-
dimensional feature space for effective training of
cross-domain NLP prediction system. We conducted
extensive experiments on cross-domain document
categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and
cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Ama-
zon product reviews. Our empirical results demon-
strated the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract
Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a pre-
diction model in a label-scarce target lan-
guage by exploiting labeled data from a label-
rich source language. An effective cross-
lingual adaptation system can substantially re-
duce the manual annotation effort required in
many natural language processing tasks. In
this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual
adaptation approach for document classifica-
tion based on learning cross-lingual discrim-
inative distributed representations of words.
Specifically, we propose to maximize the log-
likelihood of the documents from both lan-
guage domains under a cross-lingual log-
bilinear document model, while minimizing
the prediction log-losses of labeled docu-
ments. We conduct extensive experiments on
cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of
Amazon product reviews. Our experimental
results demonstrate the efficacy of the pro-
posed cross-lingual adaptation approach.
1 Introduction
With the rapid development of linguistic resources
in different languages, developing cross-lingual nat-
ural language processing (NLP) systems becomes
increasingly important (Bel et al, 2003; Shanahan
et al, 2004). Recently, cross-lingual adaptation
methods have been studied to exploit labeled infor-
mation from an existing source language domain
where labeled training data is abundant for use in
a target language domain where annotated training
data is scarce (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010). Pre-
vious work has shown that cross-lingual adaptation
can greatly reduce labeling effort for a variety of
cross language NLP tasks such as document catego-
rization (Bel et al, 2003; Amini et al, 2009), genre
classification (Petrenz and Webber, 2012), and sen-
timent classification (Shanahan et al, 2004; Wei and
Pal, 2010; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).
The fundamental challenge of cross-lingual adap-
tation stems from a lack of overlap between the fea-
ture space of the source language data and that of
the target language data. To address this challenge,
previous work in the literature mainly relies on au-
tomatic machine translation tools. They first trans-
late all the text data from one language domain into
the other and then apply techniques such as domain
adaptation (Wan et al, 2011; Rigutini and Maggini,
2005; Ling et al, 2008) and multi-view learning
(Amini et al, 2009; Guo and Xiao, 2012b; Wan,
2009) to achieve cross-lingual adaptation. However,
machine translation tools may not be freely available
for all languages. Moreover, translating all the text
data in one language into the other language is too
time-consuming in reality. As an economic alter-
native solution, cross-lingual representation learn-
ing has recently been used in the literature to learn
language-independent representations of the data for
cross language text classification (Prettenhofer and
Stein, 2010; Petrenz and Webber, 2012).
In this paper, we propose to tackle cross language
text classification by inducing cross-lingual predic-
tive data representations with both labeled and un-
labeled documents from the two language domains.
Specifically, we propose a cross-lingual log-bilinear
document model to learn distributed representations
of words, which can capture both the semantic sim-
1465
ilarities of words across languages and the predic-
tive information with respect to the target classifi-
cation task. We conduct the representation learn-
ing by maximizing the log-likelihood of all docu-
ments from both language domains under the cross-
lingual log-bilinear document model and minimiz-
ing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents.
We formulate the learning problem as a joint non-
convex minimization problem and solve it using a
local optimization algorithm. To evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct ex-
periments on the task of cross language sentiment
classification of Amazon product reviews. The em-
pirical results show the proposed approach is very
effective for cross-lingual document classification,
and outperforms other comparison methods.
2 Related Work
Much work in the literature proposes to construct
cross-lingual representations by using aligned paral-
lel data. Basically, they first employ machine trans-
lation tools to translate documents from one lan-
guage domain to the other one and then induce low
dimensional latent representations as interlingual
representations (Littman et al, 1998; Vinokourov
et al, 2002; Platt et al, 2010; Pan et al, 2011; Guo
and Xiao, 2012a). Littman et al (1998) proposed
a cross-language latent semantic indexing method
to induce interlingual representations by perform-
ing latent semantic indexing over a dual-language
document-term matrix, where each dual-language
document contains its original words and the corre-
sponding translation text. Vinokourov et al (2002)
proposed a cross-lingual kernel canonical corre-
lation analysis method, which learns two projec-
tions (one for each language) by conducting kernel
canonical correlation analysis over a paired bilin-
gual corpus and then uses the two projections to
project documents from language-specific feature
spaces to the shared multilingual semantic feature
space. Platt et al (2010) employed oriented prin-
cipal component analysis (Diamantaras and Kung,
1996) over concatenated parallel documents, which
learns a multilingual projection by simultaneously
minimizing the projected distance between paral-
lel documents and maximizing the projected covari-
ance of documents across different languages. Pan
et al (2011) proposed a bi-view non-negative matrix
tri-factorization method for cross-lingual sentiment
classification on the parallel training and test data.
Guo and Xiao (2012a) developed a transductive
subspace representation learning method for cross-
lingual text classification based on non-negative ma-
trix factorization. Some other works exploited par-
allel data by using multilingual topic models to ex-
tract cross-language latent topics as interlingual rep-
resentations (Mimno et al, 2009; Ni et al, 2011;
Platt et al, 2010; Smet et al, 2011) and using neu-
ral probabilistic language modes to learn word em-
beddings as cross-lingual distributed representations
(Klementiev et al, 2012). Most of them were de-
veloped by applying the latent Dirichlet alocation
(LDA) model (Blei et al, 2003) in a multilingual set-
ting, including the polylingual topic model (Mimno
et al, 2009), the bilingual LDA model (Smet et al,
2011), and the multilingual LDA model (Ni et al,
2011). Platt et al (2010) extended the probabilis-
tic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model (Hof-
mann, 1999) and presented two variants of multilin-
gual topic models: the joint PLSA model and the
coupled PLSA model. Recently, Klementiev et al
(2012) extended the neural probabilistic language
model (Bengio et al, 2000) to induce cross-lingual
word distributed representations on a set of word-
level aligned parallel sentences. The applicability
of these approaches however is limited by the avail-
ability of parallel corpus. Translating the whole set
of documents to produce parallel corpus is too time-
consuming, expensive and even practically impossi-
ble for some language pairs. We thus do not evaluate
those approaches in our empirical study.
Another group of works propose to use bilin-
gual dictionaries to learn interlingual representa-
tions (Gliozzo, 2006; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).
Gliozzo (2006) first translated each term from one
language to the other using a bilingual dictionary
and used the translated terms to augment origi-
nal documents. Then they conducted latent se-
mantic analysis (LSA) over the document-term ma-
trix with concatenated vocabularies to obtain in-
terlingual representations. Prettenhofer and Stein
(2010) proposed a cross-language structural cor-
respondence learning (CL-SCL) method to induce
language-independent features by using word trans-
lation oracles. They first selected a subset of source
1466
language features, which have the highest mutual in-
formation with respect to the class labels in the la-
beled documents from the source language domain,
to translate them into the target language domain,
and then used these pivot pairs to induce cross-
lingual representations by modeling the correlations
between pivot features and non-pivot features. Our
proposed approach shares a similarity with the CL-
SCL method in (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010) on
only requiring a small amount of word translations.
But our approach performs representation learning
in a semi-supervised manner by directly incorporat-
ing discriminative information with respect to the
target prediction task, while CL-SCL only exploits
labels when selecting pivot features and the struc-
tural correspondence learning process is conducted
in a fully unsupervised fashion.
Some other bilingual resources, such as multilin-
gual WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and universal part-
of-speech (POS) tags (Petrov et al, 2012), have also
been exploited in the literature for interlingual learn-
ing. Gliozzo (2006) proposed to use MultiWordNet
to map words from different languages to a common
synset-id as language-sharing terms. A similar work
was proposed in A.R. et al (2012), which trans-
formed words from different languages to WordNet
synset identifiers as interlingual sense-based rep-
resentations. However, multilingual WordNet re-
sources are not always available for different lan-
guage pairs. Recently, Petrenz and Webber (2012)
used language-specific POS taggers to tag each word
and then mapped those language-specific POS tags
to twelve universal POS tags as interlingual features
for cross language fine-grained genre classification.
This approach requires a POS tagger for each lan-
guage and it may be adversely affected by the POS
tagging accuracy.
3 Semi-Supervised Representation
Learning for Cross-Lingual Text
Classification
In this section, we introduce a semi-supervised
cross-lingual representation learning method and
then use it for cross language text classification.
Assume we have ?s labeled and us unlabeled doc-
uments in the source language domain S and ?t la-
beled and ut unlabeled documents in the target lan-
guage domain T . We assume all the documents are
independent and identically distributed in each lan-
guage domain, and each document xi is represented
as a bag of words, xi = {wi1, wi2, . . . , wiNi}. We
use (x?i , yi) to denote the i-th labeled document and
its label, and consider exploiting the labeled docu-
ments in the source domain S for learning classifiers
in the target domain T .
To build connections between the two language
domains, we first construct a set of critical bilingual
word pairs M = {(wsi , wtj)}mi=1, where wsi is a crit-
ical word in the source language domain, wtj is its
translation in the target language domain, and m is
the number of word pairs. Here being critical means
the word should be discriminative for the prediction
task and occur frequently in both language domains.
Following the work (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010),
we select bilingual word pairs in a heuristic way.
First we select a subset of words from the source lan-
guage domain, which have the highest mutual infor-
mation with the class labels in labeled source docu-
ments. The mutual information is computed based
on the empirical distributions of words and labels
in the labeled source documents. Then we translate
the selected words into the target language using a
translation tool to produce word pairs. Finally we
produce the M set by eliminating any candidate pair
(ws, wt), if either ws occurs less than a predefined
threshold value ? in all source language documents
or wt occurs less than ? in all target language docu-
ments. Given the constructed bilingual word pair set
M , the words appearing in the source language doc-
uments but not in M can be put together to form a
source specific vocabulary set Vs = {ws1, . . . , wsvs}.
Similarly, the words appearing in the target language
documents but not in M can be put together to form
a target specific vocabulary set Vt = {wt1, . . . , wtvt}.
An overall cross-lingual vocabulary set can then be
constructed as V = Vs ? Vt ? M , which has a total
of v = vs + vt + m entries. This cross-lingual vo-
cabulary set covers all words appearing in both do-
mains, while mapping each bilingual pair in M into
the same entry.
To tackle cross language text classification, we
then propose a cross-lingual log-bilinear document
model to learn a predictive cross-lingual represen-
tation of words, which maps each entry in the vo-
cabulary set V to one row vector in a word embed-
1467
ding matrix R ? Rv?k. Similar to the log-bilinear
language model (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) and the
log-bilinear document model (Maas et al, 2011),
our proposed model learns a dense feature vector for
each word to capture semantic similarities between
the vocabulary entries. But unlike the previous two
models which only work with a monolingual lan-
guage, our model also captures semantic similarities
across different languages. Moreover, we explicitly
incorporate the label information into our proposed
approach, rendering the induced word embeddings
more discriminative to the target prediction task.
3.1 Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings
As mentioned above, we assume a unified embed-
ding matrix R which contains the distributed vec-
tor representations of words in the two language
domains. However, even in a unified representa-
tion space, the distribution of words in the two do-
mains will be different. To capture the distribution
divergence of the two domains and facilitate cross-
lingual learning, we split the word embedding ma-
trix into three parts: source language specific part
Rs ? Rv?ks , common part Rc ? Rv?kc and tar-
get language specific part Rt ? Rv?kt , such that
k = ks + kc + kt. Intuitively, we assume that source
language words contain no target language specific
representations and target language words contain
no source language specific representations. Thus
for words in the two language domains, we retrieve
their distributed vector representations from the em-
bedding matrix R using two mapping functions, ?S
and ?T , one for each language domain. The two
mapping functions are defined as
?S(w) =[Rs(w), Rc(w),0t]T (1)
?T (w) =[0s, Rc(w), Rt(w)]T (2)
where 0t is a kt-dimensional row vector of zeros,
0s is a ks-dimensional row vector of zeros, Rs(w)
denotes the row vector of Rs matrix corresponding
to the word w, Rc(w) denotes the row vector of Rc
matrix corresponding to the word w, and Rt(w) de-
notes the row vector of Rt matrix corresponding to
the word w. It is easy to see that each pair of words
in M will share the same vector from Rc. To encode
more information into the common part of represen-
tation for better knowledge transfer from the source
language domain to the target language domain, we
assume kc ? ks and kc ? kt. The form of three part
feature representations has been exploited in previ-
ous work of domain adaptation with heterogeneous
feature spaces (Duan et al, 2012). However, their
approach simply duplicates the original features as
language-specific representations, while we will au-
tomatically learn those three part latent representa-
tions in our approach.
3.2 Semi-Supervised Cross-Lingual
Representation Learning
Given the word representation scheme above, we
conduct cross-lingual representation learning by si-
multaneously maximizing the log-likelihood of all
documents and the conditional likelihood of labeled
documents from the two language domains
max
?

?
?
L?{S,T }
?
x?i?L
logPL(yi|x?i , ?) (3)
where ? denotes the model parameters and ? is a
trade-off parameter. The first part of the objective
function captures the likelihood of the documents
being generated with the learned representation R.
PL(wij |?) is the probability of word wij appearing
in the document xi from the language domain L, and
is defined as
PL(wij |?) =
exp (?EL(wij , ?))
?
w??V exp (?EL(w?, ?))
(4)
The term EL(wij , ?) is a log-bilinear energy func-
tion, defined as
EL(wij , ?) = ?dTi ?L(wij) ? bwij (5)
where di is a k-dimensional weight vector for docu-
ment xi and bwij is the bias for word wij . Below we
will use b to denote a v-dimensional vector contain-
ing all words? biases.
The second part of the objective function in (3)
takes the label information into account and aims
to render the latent word representations more task-
predictive. We use a logistic regression model to
1468
compute the conditional probability of the class la-
bel given the document with the induced word rep-
resentations, such that
PL(yi|x?i , ?) =
1
1 + exp
(
?yi
(
wT?L(x?i) + q
))
(6)
where w, q are model parameters of the logistic re-
gression model, ?L(xi) is the k-dimensional vector
representation of the document xi in the language
domain L. We compute ?L(xi) by taking average
over all words in the document xi such as
?L(xi) =
1
Ni

?
j=1
?L(wij) (7)
By summing over all descriptions above, we can
see that the proposed semi-supervised representa-
tion learning has a set of model parameters, ? =
{R, {di},b,w, q}. In order to avoid overfitting, we
add regularization terms for the parameters R, {di}
and w, which leads to the final optimization problem
below

? ??R?2F ? ??w?22 (8)
where ?, ?, ? are trade-off parameters, ? ? ?F denote
the Frobenius norm and ? ? ?2 denote the Euclidean-
norm. This objective function is not jointly convex
in all model parameters. We develop a gradient-
based iterative optimization procedure to seek a lo-
cal optimal solution. We first randomly initialize the
model parameters {di}, R,w and set b and q to ze-
ros. Then we iteratively make gradient-based up-
dates over the model parameters until reach a local
optimal solution.
3.3 Cross-Lingual Document Classification
After solving (8), we obtain a word embedding ma-
trix R. The distributed vector representation of any
given document can then be computed using Eq. (7)
based on Eq. (1) or Eq. (2). Under the distributed
vector representations of the documents in both lan-
guage domains, we perform cross-lingual document
classification by training a supervised classification
model using labeled data from both language do-
mains and then applying it to classify test documents
in the target language domain .
4 Experiments
We empirically evaluate the proposed approach us-
ing the cross language sentiment classification tasks
of Amazon product reviews in four languages. In
this section, we report our experimental results.
4.1 Dataset
We used the multilingual sentiment classification
dataset1 provided by Prettenhofer and Stein (2010),
which contains Amazon product reviews in four dif-
ferent languages, English (E), French (F), German
(G) and Japanese (J). The English product reviews
were sampled from previous cross-domain senti-
ment classification datasets (Blitzer et al, 2007),
while the other three language product reviews were
crawled from Amazon by the authors in November
2009. In the dataset, each language contains three
categories of product reviews, Books (B), DVD (D)
and Music (M). Each language-category pair con-
tains a balanced training set and test set, each of
which consists of 1000 positive reviews and 1000
negative reviews. Each review is represented as
a unigram bag-of-word feature vector with term-
frequency values. Following the work (Prettenhofer
and Stein, 2010), we used the original English re-
views as the source language while treating the other
three languages as target languages. Thus, we con-
struct nine cross language sentiment classification
tasks (GB, GD, GM, FB, FD, FM, JB, JD, JM), one
for each target language-category pair. For example,
the task GB means that the target language is Ger-
man and the training and test data are samples from
Books reviews.
4.2 Approaches
We compare our proposed semi-supervised cross-
lingual representation learning (CL-RL) approach
to the following approaches for cross-lingual doc-
ument classification.

? TB: This is a target baseline method, which
trains a supervised monolingual classifier on
the labeled training data from the target lan-
guage domain without representation learning.
? CL-Dict: This is a simple baseline compar-
ison method, which uses the bilingual word
pairs directly to align features from different
language domains into a unified feature dictio-
nary and then trains a supervised classifier on
this aligned feature space with labeled training
data from both language domains.
? CLD-LSA: This is the cross-lingual represen-
tation learning method developed in (Gliozzo,
2006), which first translates each document
from one language into the other language via
a bilingual dictionary to produce augmenting
features, and then performs latent semantic
analysis (LSA) over the augmented bilingual
document-term matrix.
? CL-SCL: This is the cross language structural
correspondence learning method developed in
(Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).
? MT: This is a machine translation based com-
parison method, which first uses an existing
machine translation tool (google translation) to
translate the target language documents into the
source language and then trains a monolingual
classifier with labeled training data from both
domains in the source language.
In all experiments, we used a linear support vec-
tor machine (SVM) for sentiment classification. For
implementation, we used the liblinear package (Fan
et al, 2008) with all of its default parameters. For
the CL-SCL method, we used the same parame-
ter setting as suggested in the paper (Prettenhofer
and Stein, 2010): the number of pivot features is
set as 450, the threshold value for selecting pivot
features is 30, and the reduced dimensionality af-
ter singular value decomposition is 100. For the
CLD-LSA method, we set the dimensionality of la-
tent representation as 1000. Similarly, for our pro-
posed approach, we built the cross-lingual vocabu-
lary M by setting m = 450 and ? = 30. For
our representation learning, we set ? = 1, ? =
? = ? = 1e?4, and set ks, kc, kt to be 25, 50,
25, respectively. The values of ?, ?, ? and ? are
selected using the first cross language classifica-
tion task GB. We selected the ? value from the
set {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100} and selected ?, ?, ? values
from the set {1e?5, 1e?4, 1e?3, 1e?2, 1e?5} by re-
peating the experiment three times with random data
partitions and choosing the parameter values that led
to the best average classification accuracy.
4.3 Classification Accuracy
For each of the nine cross language sentiment classi-
fication tasks with different target language-category
pairs, we used the training set in the source language
domain (English) as labeled data while treating the
test set in the source language domain as unlabeled.

Figure 1: Average classification accuracies and standard deviations for 10 runs with respect to different numbers of
labeled training documents in the target language domain.
For target language domain, we used the test set as
test data while randomly selecting 100 documents
from the training set as labeled data and treating the
rest as unlabeled data. Thus, for each task, we have
2000 labeled documents and 2000 unlabeled docu-
ments from the source language domain, and 100
labeled and 1900 unlabeled documents from the tar-
get language domain for training. We have 2000 test
documents from the target language domain as test-
ing data. In each experiment, a classifier is produced
by each approach with the training data and tested
on the testing data. We repeated each experiment
10 times with different random selections of 100 la-
beled training documents from the target language
domain. The average classification accuracies and
standard deviations are reported in Table 1.
From Table 1, we can see that the proposed semi-
supervised cross-lingual representation learning ap-
proach, CL-RL, clearly outperforms all other com-
parison methods on eight out of the nine tasks. The
target baseline TB performs poorly on all the nine
tasks, which suggests that 100 labeled instances
from the target language is far from enough to ob-
tain an accurate sentiment classifier in the target lan-

guage domain. By exploiting the large amount of
labeled training data from the source language do-
main, even the simple cross-lingual adaptation ap-
proach, CL-Dict, produces effective improvements
over TB. However, its performance is not consis-
tent across the nine tasks. It has inferior perfor-
mance than TB on the three tasks of adapting En-
glish to the Japanese language domain. This sug-
gests the simple bilingual word-pair based feature
space unification method is far from ideal for pro-
viding effective cross-lingual representations, espe-
cially when two languages (English, Japanese) are
very different. With a better designed representa-
tion learning, CLD-LSA outperforms CL-Dict on all
the nine tasks, but the improvements are very small
on some tasks (e.g., GM). CL-SCL not only out-
performs CL-Dict on all tasks, but also performs
much better than CLD-LSA on most tasks. Its per-
formance nevertheless is inferior to the method of
MT. Though MT can greatly increase the test accu-
racies comparing to the other four methods, TB, CL-
Dict, CLD-LSA, and CL-SCL, the benefit is obtained
at the cost of whole document translations. In con-
trast, our proposed approach does not require whole
document translations, but relies on the same sim-
ple word-pair translations used in CL-Dict. It how-
ever consistently and significantly outperforms TB,
CL-Dict, CLD-LSA, and CL-SCL on all tasks, and
outperforms MT on eight out of the nine tasks.
We also conduct significance tests for our pro-
posed approach and MT using a McNemar paired
test for labeling disagreements (Gillick and Cox,
1989). The results in bold format indicate that they
are significant with p < 0.05. All these results
demonstrate the efficacy of our cross-lingual repre-
sentation learning method.
4.4 Classification Accuracy vs the Number of
Labeled Target Documents
Next, we investigated the performance of the six ap-
proaches by varying the number of labeled train-
ing documents from the target language domain.
We maintained the same experimental setting as be-
fore, but investigated a range of different values,
?t = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}, as the number of la-
beled training documents from the target language
domain. In each experiment, for a given value ?t,
we randomly selected ?t documents from the train-
ing set of the target language domain as labeled data
and used the rest as unlabeled data. We still per-
formed prediction on the same 2000 test documents
in the target language domain. We repeated each
experiment 10 times based on different random se-
lections of the labeled training data from the target
language domain. The average classification accura-
cies and standard deviations across different ?t val-
ues for all comparison methods on all the nine tasks
are plotted in Figure 1.
We can see when the number of labeled target
documents is small, TB performs poorly, especially
for the first six tasks (GB, GD, GM, FB, FD, FM).
By increasing the size of labeled target training data,
TB can greatly increase its prediction accuracies and
even outperform the CL-Dict method. The sim-
ple CL-Dict method has inconsistent performance
across the nine tasks. Its performance is better than
1472
TB when the labeled training data in the target lan-
guage domain is very limited and is poor than TB
when the labeled target data reaches 300 for the six
tasks using German and French as target languages.
Moreover, when adapting a system from English to
a much more different target language (Japanese),
CL-Dict produces much lower accuracies for all the
three tasks comparing with TB. These results show
that CL-Dict has very limited capacity on transfer-
ring labeled information from a related source lan-
guage domain. Similar performance is observed for
CLD-LSA. With a more sophisticated representation
learning, the CL-SCL method consistently outper-
forms CL-Dict. However, it produces inferior per-
formance than CLD-LSA on the tasks of JB and JM.
By using more translation resources, the MT method
outperforms TB, CL-Dict, CLD-LSA, CL-SCL in all
the nine tasks across almost all scenarios. Our pro-
posed method CL-RL significantly outperforms all
the other five comparison methods across all experi-
ments except on the task of FD, where MT produces
similar performance. Moreover, it is especially im-
portant to notice that CL-RL achieves high test ac-
curacies even when the number of labeled target in-
stances is small. This is important for transferring
knowledge from a source language to reduce the la-
beling effort in the target language.
4.5 Sensitivity Analysis
We also investigated the sensitivity of the proposed
approach over the dimensionality of the induced
cross-lingual representations. We used the same ex-
perimental setting as before, and conducted experi-
ments with a set of different dimensionality values,
k = {100, 200, 300, 400}. For each value k, we
set ks = 0.25k, kc = 0.5k, kt = 0.25k. We re-
peated each experiment for 10 times based on dif-
ferent random selections of labeled target training
data and plotted the average prediction accuracies
and standard deviations in Figure 2 for all the nine
cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks. We can
see the proposed approach produces stable accuracy
results across the range of different k values. This
suggests the proposed approach is not very sensitive
to the dimensionality of the cross-lingual embedding
features within the considered range of values, and
with a small dimensionality of 100, the induced rep-
resentation can already perform very well.
4.6 Cross-Lingual Word Representations
Finally, we used the first task GB, which adapts the
Books reviews from English to German, to gain in-
tuitive understandings over the learned cross-lingual
word representations. Given an English word as
seed word, we find its five closest neighboring En-
glish words and German words according to the Eu-
clidean distances calculated in the induced cross-
lingual representation space. We present a few re-
sults in Table 2. From Table 2, we can see that the re-
trieved words in both language domains are seman-
tically close to the seed words, which indicates that
our proposed method can capture semantic similar-
ities of words not only in a monolingual setting but
also in a multilingual setting.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a semi-supervised cross-
lingual representation learning approach to address
cross-lingual text classification. The distributed
word representation induced by the proposed ap-
proach can capture semantic similarities of words
across languages while maintaining predictive infor-
mation with respect to the target classification tasks.
To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted
experiments on nine cross language sentiment clas-
sification tasks constructed from the Amazon prod-
uct reviews in four languages, comparing to a num-
ber of comparison methods. The empirical results
showed that the proposed approach can produce
effective cross-lingual adaptation performance and
significantly outperform other comparison methods.

Abstract
Active learning and domain adaptation are
both important tools for reducing labeling
effort to learn a good supervised model in
a target domain. In this paper, we inves-
tigate the problem of online active learn-
ing within a new active domain adapta-
tion setting: there are insufficient labeled
data in both source and target domains,
but it is cheaper to query labels in the
source domain than in the target domain.
Given a total budget, we develop two cost-
sensitive online active learning methods, a
multi-view uncertainty-based method and
a multi-view disagreement-based method,
to query the most informative instances
from the two domains, aiming to learn a
good prediction model in the target do-
main. Empirical studies on the tasks of
cross-domain sentiment classification of
Amazon product reviews demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed methods on re-
ducing labeling cost.
1 Introduction
In many application domains, it is difficult or ex-
pensive to obtain labeled data to train supervised
models. It is critical to develop effective learning
methods to reduce labeling effort or cost. Active
learning and domain adaptation are both impor-
tant tools for reducing labeling cost on learning
good supervised prediction models. Active learn-
ing reduces the cost of labeling by selecting the
most informative instances to label, whereas do-
main adaptation obtains auxiliary label informa-
tion by exploiting labeled data in related domains.
Combining the efforts from both areas to further
reduce the labeling cost is an important research
direction to explore.
In this paper, we consider online active learn-
ing with domain adaptations. Online learning has
been widely studied (Borodin and El-Yaniv, 1998)
due to its advantages of low memory requirement
and fast computation speed. Dredze and Crammer
(2008) applied online learning on domain adap-
tation and proposed to combine multiple similar
source domains to perform online learning for the
target domain, which provides a new opportunity
for conducting active learning with domain adap-
tation. Online active learning with domain adap-
tation, to our knowledge, has just gained atten-
tion recently and has been addressed in (Rai et al,
2010; Saha et al, 2011). The active online do-
main adaptation methods developed in (Rai et al,
2010; Saha et al, 2011) leverage information from
the source domain by domain adaptation to intelli-
gently query labels for instances only in the target
domain in an online fashion with a given budget.
They assumed a large amount of labeled data is
readily available in the source domain.
In this work, we however tackle online active
learning with domain adaptation in a different set-
ting, where source domains with a large amount of
free labeled data are not available. Instead we as-
sume there are very few labeled instances in both
the source and target domains and labels in both
domains can be acquired with a cost. Moreover,
we assume the annotation cost for acquiring la-
bels in the source domain is much lower than the
annotation cost in the target domain. This is a
practical setting in many domain adaptation sce-
narios. For example, one aims to learn a good
review classification model for high-end comput-
ers. It may be expensive to acquire labels for such
product reviews. However, but it might be rela-
tively much cheaper (but not free) to acquire la-
bels for reviews on movies or restaurants. In such
an active learning scenario, will a source domain
with lower annotation cost still be helpful for re-
ducing the labeling cost required to learn a good
prediction model in the target domain? Our re-
search result in this paper will answer this ques-

tion. Specifically, we address this online active do-
main adaptation problem by extending the online
active learning framework in (Cesa-Bianchi et al,
2006) to consider active label acquirement in both
domains. We first initialize the prediction model
based on the initial labeled data in both the source
and target domains (LS and LT ). Then in each
round of the online learning, we receive one un-
labeled instance from each domain (DS and DT ),
on which we need to decide whether to query la-
bels. Whenever a label is acquired, we update the
prediction model using the newly labeled instance
if necessary. The framework of this online active
learning setting is demonstrated in Figure 1. We
exploit multi-view learning principles to measure
the informativeness of instances and propose two
cost-sensitive online active learning methods, a
multi-view uncertainty-based method and a multi-
view disagreement-based method, to acquire la-
bels for the most informative instances. Our em-
pirical studies on the tasks of cross-domain sen-
timent classification of Amazon product reviews
show the proposed methods can effectively ac-
quire the most informative labels given a budget,
comparing to alternative methods.
2 Related Work
The proposed work in this paper involves re-
search developments in multiple areas, including
online active learning, active domain adaptation
and multi-view active learning. In this section, we
will cover the most related work in the literature.
Online active learning has been widely stud-
ied in the literature, including the perceptron-type
methods in (Cesa-Bianchi et al, 2006; Monteleoni
and Ka?a?ria?inen, 2007; Dasgupta et al, 2009).
Cesa-Bianchi et al (2006) proposed a selective
sampling perceptron-like method (CBGZ), which
serves as a general framework of online active
learning. Monteleoni and Ka?a?ria?inen (2007) em-
pirically studied online active learning algorithms,
including the CBGZ, for optical character recogni-
tion applications. Dasgupta et al (2009) analyzed
the label complexity of the perceptron algorithm
and presented a combination method of a modifi-
cation of the perceptron update with an adaptive
filtering rule. Our proposed online active learn-
ing methods are placed on an extended framework
of (Cesa-Bianchi et al, 2006), by incorporating
domain adaptation and multi-view learning tech-
niques in an effective way.
Active domain adaptation has been studied in
(Chan and Ng, 2007; Rai et al, 2010; Saha et al,
2011; Li et al, 2012). Chan and Ng (2007) pre-
sented an early study on active domain adaptation
and empirically demonstrated that active learn-
ing can be successfully applied on out-of-domain
word sense disambiguation systems. Li et al
(2012) proposed to first induce a shared subspace
across domains and then actively label instances
augmented with the induced latent features. On-
line active domain adaptation, however, has only
been recently studied in (Rai et al, 2010; Saha
et al, 2011). Nevertheless, the active online do-
main adaptation method (AODA) and its vari-
ant method, domain-separator based AODA (DS-
AODA), proposed in these works assume a large
amount of labeled data in the source domain and
conduct online active learning only in the target
domain, which is different from our problem set-
ting in this paper.
Multi-view learning techniques have recently
been employed in domain adaptation (Tur, 2009;
Blitzer et al, 2011; Chen et al, 2011). In par-
ticular, instead of using data with conditional in-
dependent views assumed in standard multi-view
learning (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), Blitzer et al
(2011) and Chen et al (2011) randomly split
original features into two disjoint subsets to pro-
duce two views, and demonstrate the usefulness
of multi-view learning with synthetic two views.
On the other hand, multi-view active learning has
been studied in (Muslea et al, 2000, 2002; Wang
and Zhou, 2008, 2010). These works all suggest
to query labels for contention points (instances
on which different views predict different labels).
Our proposed methods will exploit this multi-view
2
principle and apply it in our multi-view online ac-
tive domain adaptation setting.
In addition, our proposed work is also related
to cost-sensitive active learning. But different
from the traditional cost-sensitive active learn-
ing, which assumes multiple oracles with different
costs exist for the same set of instances (Donmez
and Carbonell, 2008; Arora et al, 2009), we as-
sume two oracles, one for the source domain and
one for the target domain. Overall, the problem we
study in this paper is novel, practical and impor-
tant. Our research will demonstrate a combination
of advances in multiple research areas.
3 Multi-View Online Active Learning
with Domain Adaptation
Our online active learning is an extension of the
online active perceptron learning framework of
(Cesa-Bianchi et al, 2006; Rai et al, 2010) in the
cost-sensitive online active domain adaption set-
ting. We will present two multi-view online ac-
tive methods in this section under the framework
shown in Figure 1.
Assume we have a target domain (DT ) and a
related source domain (DS) with a few labeled in-
stances, LT and LS , in each of them respectively.
The instances in the two domains are drawn from
the same input space but with two different distri-
butions specified by each domain. An initial pre-
diction model (w0) can then be trained with the
current labeled data from both domains. Many
domain adaptation techniques (Sugiyama, 2007;
Blitzer et al, 2011) can be used for training here.
However, for simplicity of demonstrating the ef-
fectiveness of online active learning strategies, we
use vanilla Perceptron to train the initial prediction
model on all labeled instances, as the perceptron
algorithm is widely used in various works (Saha
et al, 2011) and can be combined seamlessly with
the online perceptron updates. It can be viewed as
a simple supervised domain adaptation training.
The very few initial labeled instances are far
from being sufficient to train a good prediction
model in the target domain. Additional labeled
data needs to be acquired to reach a reasonable
prediction model. However it takes time, money,
and effort to acquire labels in all problem domains.
For simplicity of demonstration, we use money to
measure the cost and effort of labeling instances
in each domain. Assume the cost of labeling one
instance in the source domain is cs and the cost
of labeling one instance in the target domain is ct,
where ct > cs. Note the condition ct > cs is
one criterion to be guaranteed when selecting use-
ful source domains. It does not make sense to se-
lect source domains with more expensive labeling
cost. Given a budget B, we need to make wise de-
cisions about which instances to query in the on-
line learning setting. We aim to learn the best pre-
diction model in the target domain with the labels
purchased under the given budget.
Then online active learning will be conducted in
a sequence of rounds. In each round r, we will re-
ceive two randomly sampled unlabeled instances
in parallel, xs,r and xt,r, one from each domain,
xs,r ? DS and xt,r ? DT . Active learning strate-
gies will be used to judge the informativeness of
the two instances in a cost-sensitive manner and
decide whether to query labels for any one of them
to improve the prediction model in the target do-
main. After new labels being acquired, we use the
newly labeled instances to make online perceptron
updates if the true labels are different from the pre-
dicted labels.
In this work, we focus on binary prediction
problems where the labels have binary values, y ?
{+1,?1}. We adopt the online perceptron-style
learning model of (Cesa-Bianchi et al, 2006) for
the online updates of the supervised perceptron
model. Moreover, we extend principles of multi-
view active learning into our online active learn-
ing framework. As we introduced before, syn-
thetic multi-views produced by splitting the orig-
inal feature space into disjoint subsets have been
demonstrated effective in a few previous work
(Blitzer et al, 2011; Chen et al, 2011). We adopt
this idea to generate two views of the instances
in both domains by randomly splitting the com-
mon feature space into two disjoint feature sub-
sets, such that xs,r = {x(1)s,r ,x(2)s,r} and xt,r =
{x(1)t,r ,x
(2)
t,r }. Thus the initial prediction model will
include two predictors (f (1), f (2)) with model pa-
rameters (w(1)0 ,w
(2)
0 ), each trained on one view
of the labeled data using the perceptron algorithm.
Correspondingly, the online updates will be made
on the two predictors.
The critical challenge of this cost-sensitive on-
line active learning problem nevertheless lies in
how to select the most informative instances for
labeling. Based on different measurements of
instance informativeness, we propose two on-
line active learning algorithms: a Multi-view
3
Uncertainty-based instance Selection (MUS) al-
gorithm and a Multi-view Disagreement-based
instance Selection (MDS) algorithm for cost-
sensitive online active domain adaptation, which
we will present below.
3.1 Multi-View Uncertainty-based Instance
Selection Algorithm
We use the initial model (f (1), f (2)), trained on
the two views of the initial labeled data and rep-
resented by the model parameters (w(1)0 ,w
(2)
0 ), as
the starting point of the online active learning.
In each round r of the online active learning,
we receive two instances xs,r = {x(1)s,r ,x(2)s,r} and
xt,r = {x(1)t,r ,x
(2)
t,r }, one for each domain. For the
received instances, we need to make two sequen-
tial decisions:
1. Between the instance (xs,r) from the source
domain and the instance (xt,r) from the tar-
get domain, which one should we select for
further consideration?
2. For the selected instance, do we really need
to query its label?
We answer the first question based on the label-
ing cost ratio, ct/cs, from the two domains and
define the following probability
Pc = e??(ct/cs?1) (1)
where ? is a domain preference weighting param-
eter. Then with a probability Pc we select the tar-
get instance xt,r and with a probability 1 ? Pc we
select the source instance xs,r. Our intuition is that
one should query the less expensive source domain
more frequently. Thus more labeled instances can
be collected within the fix budget. On the other
hand, the more useful and relevant but expensive
instances from the target domain should also be
queried at a certain rate.
For the selected instance x?,r, we then use a
multi-view uncertainty strategy to decide whether
to query its label. We first calculate the prediction
confidence and predicted labels of the selected in-
stance based on the current predictors trained from
each view
mk = |w(k)?x(k)?,r |, y?(k) = sign(w(k)?x(k)?,r ) (2)
where k = 1 or 2, standing for each of the two
views. If the two predictors disagree over the pre-
diction label, i.e., y?(1) 6= y?(2), the selected in-
stance is a contention point and contains useful

for each round r = 1, 2, ? ? ? do
Receive two instances xs,r, xt,r
Sample d ? U(0, 1)
if B < ct then d = 1 end if
if d > Pc then x?,r= xs,r, c = cs
else x?,r= xt,r, c = ct
end if
Compute m1,m2, y?(1), y?(2) by Eq.(2)
Compute z1, z2 by Eq.(3)
if z1 = 1 or z2 = 1 or y?(1) 6= y?(2) then
Query label y for x?,r, B = B? c
Update (w(1),w(2)) by Eq (4)
end if
if B < cs then break end if
end for
information for at least one predictor, according
to the principle of multi-view active learning. We
then decide to pay a cost (cs or ct) to query its la-
bel. Otherwise, we make the query decision based
on the two predictors? uncertainty (i.e., the inverse
of the prediction confidence mk) over the selected
instance. Specifically, we sample two numbers,
one for each view, according to
zk = Bernoulli(b/(b + mk)) (3)
where b is a prior hyperparameter, specifying the
tendency of querying labels. In our experiments,
we use b = 0.1. If either z1 = 1 or z2 = 1,
which means that at least one view is uncertain
about the selected instance, we will query for the
label y. The prediction model will be updated us-
ing the new labeled instances when the true labels
are different from the predicted ones; i.e.,
w(k) = w(k) + (yx(k)?,r )I[y 6= y?(k)] (4)
for k = 1, 2, where I[?] is an indicator function.
This multi-view uncertainty-based instance selec-
tion algorithm (MUS) is given in Algorithm 1.
3.2 Multi-View Disagreement-based Instance
Selection Algorithm
MUS is restrained to query at most one instance
at each round of the online active learning. In
this section, we present an alternative multi-view
4
disagreement-based instance selection algorithm
(MDS) within the same framework.
In each round r of the online active learning,
given the two instances xs,r and xt,r we received,
the MDS algorithm evaluates both instances for
potential label acquisition using the multi-view in-
formation provided by the two per-view predic-
tors. Let y?(1)s and y?(2)s denote the predicted la-
bels of instance xs,r produced by the two predic-
tors according to Eq (2). Similarly let y?(1)t and
y?(2)t denote the predicted labels of instance xt,r.
Follow the principle suggested in the multi-view
active learning work (Muslea et al, 2000, 2002;
Wang and Zhou, 2008, 2010) that querying labels
for contention points (instances on which different
views predict different labels) can lead to superior
information gain than querying uncertain points,
we identify the non-redundant contention points
from the two domains for label acquisition.
Specifically, there are three cases: (1) If only
one of the instances is a contention point, we query
its label with probability Pc (Eq (1)) when the in-
stance is from the target domain, and query its la-
bel with probability 1 ? Pc when the instance is
from the source domain. (2) If both instances are
contention points, i.e., y?(1)s 6= y?(2)s and y?(1)t 6= y?
(2)
t ,
but the predicted labels for the two instances are
the same, i.e., y?(k)s = y?(k)t for k = 1, 2, it suggests
the two instances contain similar information with
respect to the prediction model and we only need
to query one of them. We then select the instance
in a cost-sensitive manner stated in the MUS algo-
rithm by querying the target instance with a prob-
ability Pc and querying the source instance with a
probability 1 ? Pc. (3) If both instances are con-
tention points but with different predicted labels, it
suggests the two instances contain complementary
information with respect to the prediction model,
and we thus query labels for both of them.
For any new labeled instance from the target
domain or the source domain, we update the pre-
diction model of each review using Equation (4)
when the acquired true label is different from the
predicted label. The overall MDS algorithm is
given in Algorithm 2.
3.3 Multi-View Prediction
After the training process, we use the two predic-
tors to predict labels of the test instances from
the target domain. Given a test instance xt =

if d ? Pc then qt = 1 end if
else if ds = 1 and dt = 1
if y?(1)s = y?(1)t then

end if

k?{1,2}
|w(k)?x(k)t | (5)

With this multi-view prediction on the test data,
the multi-view strengths can be exploited in the
testing phase as well.

4 Experiments
In this section, we present the empirical evaluation
of the proposed online active learning methods on
the task of sentiment classification comparing to
alternative baseline methods. We first describe the
experimental setup, and then present the results
and discussions.
4.1 Experimental Setup
Dataset For the sentiment classification task, we
use the dataset provided in (Prettenhofer and Stein,
2010). The dataset contains reviews with four
different language versions and in three domains,
Books (B), DVD (D) and Music (M). Each domain
contains 2000 positive reviews and 2000 negative
reviews, with a term-frequency (TF) vector rep-
resentation. We used the English version and con-
structed 6 source-target ordered domain pairs from
the original 3 domains: B2D, D2B, B2M, M2B,
D2M, M2D. For example, for the task of B2D, we
use the Books reviews as the source domain and
the DVD reviews as the target domain. For each
pair of domains, we built a unigram vocabulary
over the combined 4000 source reviews and 4000
target reviews. We further preprocessed the data
by removing features that appear less than twice
in either domain, replacing TF with TFIDF, and
normalizing the attribute values into [0, 1].
Approaches In the experiments, we mainly
compared the proposed MUS and MDS algorithms
with the following three baseline methods. (1)
MTS (Multi-view Target instance Selection): It
is a target-domain variant of the MUS algorithm,
and selects the most uncertain instance received
from the target domain to query according to the
procedure introduced for MUS method. (2) TCS
(Target Contention instance Selection): It is a
target-domain variant of the MDS algorithm, and
uses multi-view predictors to query contention in-
stances received from the target domain. (3) SUS
(Single-view Uncertainty instance Selection): It
selects target vs source instances according to Pc
(see Eq.(1)), and then uses uncertainty measure to
make query decision. This is a single view vari-
ant of the MUS algorithm. In the experiments, we
used ? = 1 for the Pc computation in Eq.(1).
4.2 Classification Accuracy
We first conducted experiments over the 6 do-
main adaptation tasks constructed from the sen-
timent classification data with a fixed cost ratio
ct/cs = 3. We set cs = 1 and ct = 3. Given a bud-
getB = 900, we measure the classification perfor-
mance of the prediction model learned by each on-
line active learning method during the process of
budget being used. We started with 50 labeled in-
stances from the source domain and 10 labeled in-
stances from the target domain. The classification
performance is measured over 1000 test instances
from the target domain. All other instances are
used as inputs in the online process. We repeated
the experiments 10 times using different random
online instance input orders. The average results
are reported in Figure 2.
The results indicate the proposed two algo-
rithms, MUS and MDS, in general greatly out-
perform the other alternative methods. The SUS
method, which is a single-view variant of MUS,
presents very poor performance across all 6 tasks
comparing to the other multi-view based methods,
which demonstrates the efficacy of the multi-view
instance selection mechanism. Among the multi-
view based active learning methods, the MTS
method and TCS method, which only query labels
for more relevant but expensive instances from
the target domain, demonstrated inferior perfor-
mance, comparing to their cost-sensitive counter-
parts, MUS and MDS, respectively. This suggests
that a cheaper source domain is in general helpful
on reducing the labeling cost for learning a good
prediction model in the target domain and our pro-
posed active learning strategies are effective.
4.3 Domain Divergence
To further validate and understand our experimen-
tal results on the sentiment classification data, we
evaluated the domain divergence over the three
pairs of domains we used in the experiments
above. Note, if the domain divergence is very
small, it will be natural that a cheaper source do-
main should help on reducing the labeling cost in
the target domain. If the domain divergence is very
big, the space of exploring a cheaper source do-
main will be squeezed.
The divergence of two domains can be mea-
sured using the A-distance (Ben-David et al,
2006). We adopted the method of (Rai et al, 2010)
to proximate the A-distance. We train a linear
classifier over all 8000 instances, 4000 instances
from each domain, to separate the two domains.
The average per-instance hinge-loss for this sepa-
rator subtracted from 1 was used as the estimate

of the proxy A-distance. A score of 1 means per-
fectly separable distributions and 0 means the two
distributions from the two domains are identical.
In general, a higher score means a larger diver-
gence between the two domains.
Table 1: Proxy A-distance over domain pairs.
Domains A-distance
Books vs. DVD 0.7221
Books vs. Music 0.8562
DVD vs. Music 0.7831
The proxy A-distances over the 3 domain pairs
from the sentiment classification dataset are re-
ported in Table 1. It shows that all the 3 pairs
of domains are reasonably far apart. This justi-
fied the effectiveness of the online active domain
adaptation methods we developed and the results
we reported above. It suggests the applicability of
the proposed active learning scheme is not bound
to the existence of highly similar source domains.
Moreover, the A-distance between Books and Mu-
sic is the largest among the three pairs. Thus it
is most challenging to exploit the source domain
in the adaptation tasks, B2M and M2B. This ex-
plains the good performance of the target-domain
method TCS on these two tasks. Nevertheless, the
proposed MUS and MDS maintained consistent
good performance even on these two tasks.
4.4 Robustness to Cost Ratio
We then studied the empirical behavior of the pro-
posed online active domain adaptation algorithms
with different cost ratio values ct/cs.
Given a fixed budget B = 900, we set cs = 1
and run a few sets of experiments on the senti-
ment classification data by setting ct as different
values from {1, 2, 3, 4}, under the same experi-
mental setting described above. In addition to
the five comparison methods used before, we also
added a baseline marker, SCS, which is a source-
domain variant of the MDS algorithm and queries
contention instances from only the source domain.
The final classification performance of the predic-
tion model learned with each approach is recorded

after the whole budget being used. The average
results over 10 runs are reported in Figure 3.
We can see that: (1) With the increasing of
the labeling cost in the target domain, the perfor-
mance of all methods except SCS decreases since
the same budget can purchase fewer labeled in-
stances from the target domain. (2) The three cost-
sensitive methods (SUS, MUS, and MDS), which
consider the labeling cost when making query de-
cisions, are less sensitive to the cost ratios than the
MTS and TCS methods, whose performance de-
grades very quickly with the increasing of ct/cs.
(3) It is reasonable that when ct/cs is very big,
the SCS, which simply queries source instances,
produces the best performance. But the proposed
two cost-sensitive active learning methods, MUS
and MDS, are quite robust to the cost ratios across
a reasonable range of ct/cs values, and outper-
form both source-domain only and target-domain
only methods. When ct = cs, the proposed cost-
sensitive methods automatically favor target in-
stances and thus achieve similar performance as
TCS. When ct becomes much larger than cs, the
proposed cost-sensitive methods automatically ad-
just to favor cheaper source instances and maintain
their good performance.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the online active do-
main adaptation problem in a novel but practical
setting where we assume labels can be acquired
with a lower cost in the source domain than in the
target domain. We proposed two multi-view on-
line active learning algorithms, MUS and MDS, to
address the proposed problem. The proposed al-
gorithms exploit multi-view active learning learn-
ing principles to measure the informativeness of
instances and select instances in a cost-sensitive
manner. Our empirical studies on the task of cross-
domain sentiment classification demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed methods. This research
shows that a cheaper source domain can help on
reducing labeling cost for learning a good pre-
diction model in the related target domain, with
proper designed active learning algorithms.

Abstract
This paper proposes to learn language-
independent word representations to ad-
dress cross-lingual dependency parsing,
which aims to predict the dependency
parsing trees for sentences in the target
language by training a dependency parser
with labeled sentences from a source lan-
guage. We first combine all sentences
from both languages to induce real-valued
distributed representation of words under
a deep neural network architecture, which
is expected to capture semantic similari-
ties of words not only within the same lan-
guage but also across different languages.
We then use the induced interlingual word
representation as augmenting features to
train a delexicalized dependency parser on
labeled sentences in the source language
and apply it to the target sentences. To in-
vestigate the effectiveness of the proposed
technique, extensive experiments are con-
ducted on cross-lingual dependency pars-
ing tasks with nine different languages.
The experimental results demonstrate the
superior cross-lingual generalizability of
the word representation induced by the
proposed approach, comparing to alterna-
tive comparison methods.
1 Introduction
With the rapid development of linguistic resources
and tools in multiple languages, it is very im-
portant to develop cross-lingual natural language
processing (NLP) systems. Cross-lingual depen-
dency parsing is the task of inferring dependency
trees for observed sentences in a target language
where there are few or no labeled training sen-
tences by using a dependency parser trained on
a large amount of sentences with annotated de-
pendency trees in a source language (Durrett et
al., 2012; McDonald et al., 2011; Zhao et al.,
2009). Cross-lingual dependency parsing is pop-
ularly studied in natural language processing area
as it can greatly reduce the expensive manual an-
notation effort in the target language by exploit-
ing the dependency annotations from a source lan-
guage (Durrett et al., 2012; McDonald et al., 2011;
Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012).
One fundamental challenge of cross-lingual de-
pendency parsing stems from the word-level rep-
resentation divergence across languages. Since
sentences in different languages are expressed
using different vocabularies, if we train a de-
pendency parser on the word-level features of
sentences from a source language, it will fail
to parse the sentences in a different target lan-
guage. A variety of work in the literature has at-
tempted to bridge the word-level representation di-
vergence across languages. One intuitive method
delexicalizes the dependency parser by replac-
ing the language-specific word-level features with
language-independent features such as universal
part-of-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2012). With the
universal POS tag features, this method provides
a possible way to transfer dependency parsing in-
formation from the source language to the target
language and has demonstrated some good empir-
ical results (McDonald et al., 2011). However, the
number of universal POS tags is small, which lim-
its their discriminative capacity as input features
for dependency parsing. A few other works hence
propose to improve the delexicalized system by
learning more effective cross-lingual features such
as bilingual word clusters (Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012)
and other interlingual representations (Durrett et
al., 2012).
In this paper, we propose to address cross-
lingual dependency parsing by learning distributed
interlingual word representations using a deep
neural network architecture. We first combine
all the sentences from two language domains and
119
build cross language word connections based on
Wikitionary, which works as a free bilingual dic-
tionary. Then by exploiting a deep learning archi-
tecture, we learn real-valued dense feature vectors
for the words in the given sentences as the high-
level interlingual representations, which capture
semantic similarities across languages. Finally, we
use the induced distributed word representation as
augmenting features to train a delexicalized de-
pendency parser on the annotated sentences in the
source language and applied it on the sentences in
the target language. In order to evaluate the pro-
posed cross-lingual learning technique, we con-
duct extensive experiments on eight cross-lingual
dependency parsing tasks with nine different lan-
guages. The experimental results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed approach in transferring
dependency parsers across languages, comparing
to other methods.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section
3 describes the main approach of cross-lingual
word representation learning with deep neural net-
works and cross-lingual dependency parsing with
induced interlingual features. Section 4 presents
the empirical study on eight cross language depen-
dency parsing tasks. We then conclude the paper
in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Previous works developed in the literature have
tackled cross-lingual dependency parsing by us-
ing cross-lingual annotation projection methods,
multilingual model learning methods, and cross-
lingual representation learning methods.
Cross-lingual annotation projection methods
use parallel sentences to project the annotations
from the source language side to the target lan-
guage side and then train dependency parsers on
the target data with projected annotations (Hwa
et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2013; Smith and Eis-
ner, 2009; Zhao et al., 2009). For cross-lingual
annotation projection methods, both the word
alignment training step and the annotation pro-
jection step can introduce errors or noise. Thus
much work developed in the literature has fo-
cused on designing robust projection algorithms
such as graph-based projection with label prop-
agations (Das and Petrov, 2011), improving pro-
jection performance by using auxiliary resources
such as Wikipedia metadata (Kim and Lee, 2012)
or WordNet (Khapra et al., 2010), or boosting pro-
jection performance by heuristically modifying or
correcting the projected annotations (Hwa et al.,
2005; Kim et al., 2010). Some work has also
proposed to project the discrete dependency arc
instances instead of treebank as the training set
(Liu et al., 2013). Moreover, besides cross-lingual
dependency parsing, cross-lingual annotation pro-
jection methods have also demonstrated success
in various other sequence labeling tasks includ-
ing POS tagging (Das and Petrov, 2011; Yarowsky
and Ngai, 2001), relation extraction (Kim et al.,
2012), named entity recognition (Kim et al., 2010;
Kim and Lee, 2012), constituent syntax parsing
(Jiang et al., 2011), and word sense disambigua-
tion (Khapra et al., 2010).
Multilingual model learning methods train
cross-lingual dependency parsers with parameter
constraints obtained from parallel data (Liu et al.,
2013; Ganchev et al., 2009) or linguistic knowl-
edges (Naseem et al., 2010; Naseem et al., 2012).
Among these methods, some proposed to train
a joint dependency parsing system with parame-
ters shared across the dependency parsing models
in individual languages (Liu et al., 2013). Other
works used posterior regularization techniques to
encode the linguistic constraints in learning de-
pendency parsing models (Ganchev et al., 2009;
Naseem et al., 2010; Naseem et al., 2012). The
linguistic constraints may either come from man-
ually constructed universal dependency parsing
rules (Naseem et al., 2010) or manually specified
typological features (Naseem et al., 2012), or be
learned from parallel sentences (Ganchev et al.,
2009). Besides cross-lingual dependency parsing,
multilingual model learning methods have also
achieved good empirical results for other multilin-
gual NLP tasks, including named entity recogni-
tion (Burkett et al., 2010; Che et al., 2013; Wang
and Manning, 2014), syntactic parsing (Burkett
et al., 2010), semantic role labeling (Zhuang and
Zong, 2010; Kozhevnikov and Titov, 2012), and
word sense disambiguation (Guo and Diab, 2010).
Cross-lingual representation learning methods
induce language-independent features to bridge
the cross-lingual difference in the original word-
level representation space and build connections
across different languages. They train a depen-
dency parser in the induced representation space
by exploiting labeled data from the source lan-
guage and apply it in the target language (Dur-
120
rett et al., 2012; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012; Zhang
et al., 2012). A variety of auxiliary resources
have been used to induce interlingual features, in-
cluding bilingual lexicon (Durrett et al., 2012),
and unlabeled parallel sentences (Ta?ckstro?m et al.,
2013). Based on different learning mechanisms
(whether or not using labeled data) for induc-
ing language-independent features, cross-lingual
representation learning methods can be cate-
gorized into unsupervised representation learn-
ing (Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2013) and supervised
representation learning (Durrett et al., 2012).
The language-independent features include bilin-
gual word clusters (Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012),
language-independent projection features (Durrett
et al., 2012), and automatically induced language-
independent POS tags (Zhang et al., 2012). Be-
sides cross-lingual dependency parsing, in the lit-
erature cross-lingual representation learning meth-
ods have also demonstrated efficacy in different
NLP applications such as cross language named
entity recognition (Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012) and
cross language semantic role labeling (Titov and
Klementiev, 2012). Our work shares similarity
with these cross-lingual representation learning
methods on inducing new language-independent
features, but differs from them in that we learn
cross-lingual word embeddings. Though multilin-
gual word embeddings have been employed in the
literature, they are developed for other NLP tasks
such as cross-lingual sentiment analysis (Klemen-
tiev et al., 2012), and machine translation (Zou
et al., 2013). Moreover, the method in (Klemen-
tiev et al., 2012) requires parallel sentences with
observed word-level alignments, and the method
in (Zou et al., 2013) first learns language-specific
word embeddings in each language separately
and then transforms representations from one lan-
guage to another language with machine trans-
lation alignments, while we jointly learn cross-
lingual word embeddings in the two languages by
only exploiting a small set of bilingual word pairs.
From the perspective of applying deep networks
in natural language processing systems, there are
a number of works in the literature (Collobert and
Weston, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011; Henderson,
2004; Socher et al., 2011; Titov and Henderson,
2010; Turian et al., 2010). Socher et al. (2011) ap-
plied recursive autoencoders to address sentence-
level sentiment classification problems. Collobert
and Weston (2008) and Collobert et al. (2011)
employed a deep learning framework for jointly
multi-task learning and empirically evaluated it
with four NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tag-
ging, chunking, named entity recognition, and se-
mantic role labeling. Henderson (2004) proposed
discriminative training methods for learning a neu-
ral network statistical parser. Titov and Hender-
son (2010) extended the incremental sigmoid Be-
lief networks (Titov and Henderson, 2007) to a
generative latent variable model for dependency
parsing. Turian et al. (2010) employed neural net-
works to induce word representations for sequence
labeling tasks such as named entity recognition.
3 Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing
with Word Representation Learning
In this work, we aim to tackle cross-lingual depen-
dency parsing by learning language-independent
distributed word representations with deep neural
networks. We first build connections across lan-
guages using free bilingual dictionaries. Then we
introduce the deep neural network framework for
cross-lingual word representation learning and de-
scribe how to employ the induced dense word em-
beddings for cross-lingual dependency parsing.
3.1 Building Cross Language Connections
To induce cross-lingual word representations, we
first need to build connections between the source
and target languages. In this work, we produce
such connections by finding cross-lingual word
pairs using the Wikitionary1, which works as free
bilingual dictionaries between language pairs.
Specifically, we first constructed a source lan-
guage dictionary with all words that appeared in
the sentences from the source language domain
and translate these words to the target language
using the Wikitionary. Then we filtered the pro-
duced word-to-word translations by dropping the
ones where either the same source language word
has multiple different word translations in the tar-
get language or the same target language word
corresponds to multiple different source language
words. We further dropped the word pairs where
the translated word in the target language does not
appear in the given sentences in the target lan-
guage domain. After the processing, we have a set
of one-to-one bilingual word pairs to build con-
nections between the two language domains. Fi-
nally, we built a unified bilingual vocabulary V

work for learning cross-lingual word representa-
tions. Each word w

from the training sample x

R(w
i
) through the embedding matrix R.
with words from all sentences of the two language
domains. For each one-to-one bilingual word pair
we constructed, we assume the two words have
equivalent semantic meaning and map them to the
same entry in V . Next we will learn a distributed
vector representation for each entry of the bilin-
gual vocabulary V using deep neural networks.
By sharing the same representation vectors, the
constructed bilingual word pairs will serve as the
bridge across languages.
3.2 Interlingual Word Representation
Learning with Deep Neural Networks
Given the constructed bilingual vocabulary V with
v entries, we will learn a latent word embedding
matrix R ? Rk?v over the sentences in the two
language domains by using a deep neural network
model. This embedding matrix will map each
word w in the vocabulary V into a real valued rep-
resentation vector R(w) with length k. For each
bilingual pair of words that are mapped into the
same entry of V , they will be mapped into the
same vector in R as well. Following the strat-
egy of (Collobert et al., 2011), we construct a
simple two-class classification problem over the
given sentences. We use the sub-sentences with
fixed window size c constructed from the given
sentences in the two language domains as posi-
tive samples and construct the negative samples by
replacing the middle word of each positive sub-
sentence with a random word from V . We then
train a deep neural network for this two-class clas-
sification problem, while simultaneously learning
the latent embedding matrix R.
The deep neural network architecture is given
in Figure 1. The bottom layer of the deep archi-
tecture is the input layer, which takes a sequence
of word tokens, x = w
1
, w
2
, . . . , w
c
, with a fixed
window size c as the input instance. Then we map
each word w
i
in this sequence to an embedding
vector R(w
i
) by treating the bilingual embedding
matrix R as a look-up table. The embedding vec-
tors of the sequence of words x will be concate-
nated into a long vector R(x) ? Rck such that
R(x) = [R(w
1
);R(w
2
); . . . ;R(w
c
)]. (1)
R(x) will then be used as input for the hidden
layer above it. The deep neural network has mul-
tiple hidden layers. The first hidden layer applies
a nonlinear hyperbolic tangent activation function
over the linear transformation of its input vector
R(x), such that
H
1
(x) = tanh (W
1
?R(x) + b
1
) (2)
where W
1
? R
h
1
?ck is the weight parameter
matrix, b
1
? R
h
1 is the bias parameter vector,
H
1
(x) ? R
h
1 is the output vector, and h
1
is the
number of hidden units in the first hidden layer.
Similarly, each of the other hidden layers takes the
previous layer?s output as its input and performs
a nonlinear transformation to produce an output
vector. For example, for the i-th hidden layer, we
used H
i?1
(x) as its input and H
i
(x) as its output
such that
H
i
(x) = tanh (W
i
?H
i?1
(x) + b
i
) (3)
where W
i
? R
h
i
?h
i?1 is the weight parameter ma-
trix and b
i
is the bias parameter vector for the i-
th hidden layer; h
i
denotes the number of hidden
units of the i-th hidden layer.
Given t hidden layers, the output representation
of the last layer will then be used to generate a
final score value for the prediction task, such that
s(x) = ? ?H
t
(x) + u (4)
122
where ? ? Rht is the weight parameter vector and
u is the bias parameter for the output layer.
In summary, the model parameters of the deep
neural network architecture include the look-up ta-
ble R, the parameters {W
i
,b
i
}
t
i=1
for the hidden
layers, and the output layer parameters (?, u).
3.3 The Training Procedure
The model parameters of the deep network archi-
tecture are learned by training a two-class classifi-
cation model over the the constructed positive and
negative samples. Let D = {x
i
,
?
x
i
}
N
i=1
denote
the constructed training set, where x
i
is a positive
sample and ?x
i
is a negative sample constructed by
replacing the middle word of x
i
with a random
word from V . It is desirable for the model to pro-
duce an output score s(x
i
) that is much larger than
the score s(?x
i
) for each pair of training instances.
Thus we perform training to maximize the separa-
tion margins between the pairs of scores over pos-
itive and negative samples under a hinge loss; that
is we minimize the following training loss
J(D) =
1
N
N
?
i=1
max(0, 1? s(x
i
) + s(
?
x
i
)) (5)
We perform a random initialization over the
look-up table and weight model parameters, and
set all the bias model parameters to zeros. Then we
use a stochastic gradient descent (Bottou, 1991)
algorithm to perform optimization.
3.4 Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing
The training of deep network model above will
produce a word embedding matrix R for all words
in the two language domains. Moreover, by hav-
ing each translated bilingual pair of words shar-
ing the same representation vector in R in the
training process, the embedding matrix R is ex-
pected to capture consistent and comparable se-
mantic meanings across languages, and provide a
language-independent and distributed representa-
tion for each word in the bilingual dictionary V .
Given R, for each sentence x = w
1
, w
2
, . . . , w
n
from the two language domains, we retrieved the
representation vector R(w
i
) for each word w
i
.
Moreover, we further delexicalized the sentence
by replacing the sequence of language-specific
words with a sequence of universal POS tags
(Petrov et al., 2012). Finally we train a delexical-
ized dependency parser on the labeled sentences
in the source language based on the universal POS
tag features and the learned distributed features.
and apply it to perform dependency parsing on the
sentences in the target language domain.
4 Experiments
We empirically evaluated the proposed cross-
lingual word representation learning for cross-
lingual dependency parsing. In this section, we
present the experimental setup and the results.
4.1 Dataset
We used the dataset from the CoNLL shared task
(Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007) for
cross-lingual dependency parsing. We conducted
experiments with the following nine languages:
English (EN), Danish (DA), German (DE), Greek
(EL), Spanish (ES), Italian (IT), Dutch (NL), Por-
tuguese (PT) and Swedish (SV). For each lan-
guage, there is a separate training set and a test set.
We used English, which usually has more labeled
resources, as the source language, while treat-
ing the others as target languages. We thus con-
structed eight cross-lingual dependency parsing
tasks (EN2DA, EN2DE, EN2EL, EN2ES, EN2IT,
EN2NL, EN2PT, EN2SV), one for each of the
eight target languages. For example, the task
EN2DA means that we used Danish (DA) as the
target language while using English (EN) as the
source language. For each cross language de-
pendency parsing task, we first performed repre-
sentation learning and then conducted dependency
parsing training and test.
In this dataset, each sentence is labeled with
gold standard part-of-speech tags. To produce
delexicalized cross-lingual dependency parsers,
we mapped these language-specific part-of-speech
tags into twelve universal POS tags (Petrov et al.,
2012): ADJ (adjectives), ADP (prepositions or
postpositions), ADV (adverbs), CONJ (conjunc-
tions), DET (determiners), NOUN (nouns), NUM
(numerals), PRON (pronouns), PRT (particles),
PUNC (punctuation marks), VERB (verbs) and X
(for others).
4.2 Representation Learning
For each language pair, we produced a set of one-
to-one bilingual word pairs using Wikitionary to
build cross language connections. The numbers
of bilingual word pairs produced for all the eight
language pairs and the numbers of words in each
language are given in Table 1.

of the eight language pairs.

To perform distributed cross-lingual representa-
tion learning using the proposed deep network ar-
chitecture, we first constructed the two-class train-
ing dataset from all the sentences (training and
test sentences) of the two language domains. This
requires the creation of sub-sentences with fixed
window size c from the given sentences. We used
window size c = 5 in the experiments. For ex-
ample, for a given sentence ?I visited New York
.? , we can produce a number of sub-sentences,
including ?<PAD> <S> I visited New?, ?<S> I
visited New York?, ?I visited New York .?, ?vis-
ited New York . </S>?, and ?New York . </S>
<PAD>?, where <PAD> is special token to fill
the length requirement. Negative samples are con-
structed by simply replace the middle word of each
sub-sentence with a random word.
With the constructed training data, we then per-
formed training over the deep neural network. We
used 3 hidden layers with 100 hidden units in
each layer, considering the model capacity and the
training effort. The dimension k of the embedding
word vectors in R is set as 200.
4.3 Cross-lingual Dependency Parsing
We used the MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005a;
McDonald et al., 2005b) as the basic dependency
parsing model. MSTParser uses spanning tree
algorithms to seek for the candidate dependency
trees and employs an online large margin train-
ing optimization algorithm. MSTParser is widely
used in the literature for dependency parsing tasks
and has demonstrated good empirical results in the
CoNLL shared tasks on multilingual dependency
parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al.,
2007). For this dependency parsing model, there
are a few parameters to be set: the number of max-
imum iterations for the perceptron training, and
the number of best-k dependency tree candidates.
We set the number of iterations to be 10 and only
considered the best-1 dependency tree candidate.
For the proposed cross-lingual dependency
parsing approach, we used both the delexi-

calized universal POS tag based features and
the language-independent word features produced
from the deep learning as input features for the
MSTParser. The set of universal POS tag based
feature templates is given in Table 2. For each
dependency relationship between a head word w
h
and a dependent word w
d
, a set of features can
be produced from the feature templates in Ta-
ble 2, which can be further augmented by R(w
h
)
and R(w
d
). We compared our proposed approach
(Proposed) with three other methods, Baseline,
Proj and X-lingual. The Baseline method uses a
delexicalized MSTParser based only on the uni-
versal POS tag features. The Proj method is devel-
oped in (Durrett et al., 2012), which uses a bilin-
gual dictionary to learn cross-lingual features and
then uses them as augmenting features to train a
delexicalized MSTParser. The X-lingual method
uses unlabeled parallel sentences to learn cross-
lingual word clusters and used them as augment-
ing features to train a delexicalized MSTParser
(Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012). All parsers except X-
lingual are trained on the labeled sentences in the
source language domain and tested on the test
sentences in the target language domain in the
given dataset. The performance is measured using
the standard unlabeled attachment score (UAS).
The X-lingual method uses different auxiliary re-
sources (parallel sentences), and we hence directly
cited the results reported in (Ta?ckstro?m et al.,
2012) on the same dataset.
4.4 Results and Discussions
We reported the empirical comparison results in
terms of unlabeled attachment score (UAS) in Ta-
ble 3. We can see that the Baseline method per-
Table 4: Statistic differences. For each task, we
report the percentage of sentences in the test data
from the target language which share the same se-
quence of universal POS tags with some sentences
in the source language but with different depen-
dency trees.
Target Language Sentence Difference
Danish 0.31%
Dutch 1.81%
German 1.40%
Greek 1.20%
Italian 2.40%

forms poorly across all the tasks. The average un-
labeled attachment score for this approach across
all the eight tasks is very low (about 55.14), which
suggests that the twelve universal POS tags are far
from enough to produce a good cross-lingual de-
pendency parser. Considering the small number
of universal POS tags, its limited discriminative
capacity as input features for dependency pars-
ing is understandable. To further verify this, we
calculated the percentage of sentences in the test
data which share the same sequence of universal
POS tags with a training sentence in the source
language but have different dependency parsing
structures. The values for the eight tasks are pre-
sented in Table 4. The non-trivial values reported
verified the universal POS tags? drawback on lack-
ing discriminative capacity.
By relexicalizing the delexicalized MSTParser
125
via augmenting the POS tag sequences with
learned interlingual features, both the Proj method
and the proposed method overcome the draw-
back of using solely universal POS tags and pro-
duce significant improvements over the Baseline
method across all the tasks. Moreover, the pro-
posed method consistently outperforms both Base-
line and Proj for all the eight tasks. By exploit-
ing only free bilingual dictionaries, the proposed
method achieves similar average performance to
the X-lingual method which requires additional
parallel sentences. All these results demonstrated
the efficacy of our word representation learning
method for cross-lingual dependency parsing.
4.5 Impact of Labeled Training Data in
Target Language
In the experiments above, all the labeled sen-
tences for dependency parsing training are from
the source language. We wonder how much bene-
fit we can get if there are a small number of labeled
sentences in the target language as well. To answer
this question, we conducted experiments by using
a small number (?
t
) of labeled sentences in the
target language domain together with the labeled
sentences in the source language domain to train
cross-lingual dependency parsers. Again the per-
formance of the parsers are evaluated on the test
sentences in the target language. We tested a few
different ?
t
values with ?
t
? {500, 1000, 1500}.
We reported the unlabeled attachment score for all
the eight cross-lingual dependency parsing tasks
in Figure 2. We can see that the Baseline method
still performs poorly across the range of different
setting for all the eight tasks. The Proj method
and the proposed method again consistently out-
perform the baseline method across all the tasks,
while the proposed method achieves the best re-
sults across all the eight tasks.
4.6 Impact of the Number of Bilingual Word
Pairs
For the eight language pairs, we have reported
the numbers of words in each language domain
and the numbers of selected bilingual word pairs
in Table 1. Next we investigated how the num-
ber of word pairs affects the performance of the
proposed cross-lingual dependency parsing. With
the selected full set of bilingual word pairs in
Table 1, we random selected m% of them with
m ? {50, 75, 100} to conduct experiments. Note
when m = 50, we only used 435 word pairs for
the EN2EL (English vs. Greek) task, which is
1.6% of the number of source words and 3.3% of
the number of target words. The results are re-
ported in Figure 3. We can see that by reducing the
number of bilingual word pairs, the performance
of the proposed cross-lingual dependency parsing
method degrades on all tasks. This is reasonable
since the word pairs serve as the pivots for learn-
ing cross-lingual word embeddings. Nevertheless,
by preserving 75% of the selected word pairs, the
proposed approach can still outperform the Proj
method across all the tasks. Even with only 50%
of the word pairs, our method still outperforms
the Proj method on most tasks. These results sug-
gest that the proposed cross-lingual word embed-
ding method only requires a reasonable amount of
bilingual word pairs to effectively transfer a de-
pendency parser from the source language to the
target language.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed to automatically learn
language-independent features within a deep neu-
ral network architecture to address cross-lingual
dependency parsing problems. We first con-
structed a set of bilingual word pairs with Wiki-
tionary, which serve as the pivots in the bilingual
vocabulary for building connections across lan-
guages. We then conducted distributed word rep-
resentation learning by training a constructed aux-
iliary classifier using deep neural networks, which
induced a real-valued embedding vector for each
word of the bilingual vocabulary to capture con-

sistent semantic similarities for words in the two
language domains. The distributed word embed-
ding vectors were then used to augment the uni-
versal POS tags to train cross-lingual dependency
parsers. We empirically evaluated the proposed
method on eight cross-lingual dependency parsing
tasks between eight language pairs. The experi-

the proposed method, comparing to other cross-
