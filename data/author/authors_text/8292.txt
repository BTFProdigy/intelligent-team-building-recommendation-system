Abstract
Coedition of a natural language text and its representation in some interlingual form seems the best and simplest way to
share text revision across languages. For various reasons, UNL graphs are the best candidates in this context. We are
developing a prototype where, in the simplest sharing scenario, naive users interact directly with the text in their
language (L0), and indirectly with the associated graph. The modified graph is then sent to the UNL-L0 deconverter and
the result shown. If is is satisfactory, the errors were probably due to the graph, not to the deconverter, and the graph is
sent to deconverters in other languages. Versions in some other languages known by the user may be displayed, so that
improvement sharing is visible and encouraging. As new versions are added with appropriate tags and attributes in the
original multilingual document, nothing is ever lost, and cooperative working on a document is rendered feasible. On the
internal side, liaisons are established between elements of the text and the graph by using broadly available resources
such as a L0-English or better a L0-UNL dictionary, a morphosyntactic parser of L0, and a canonical graph2tree
transformation. Establishing a "best" correspondence between the "UNL-tree+L0" and the "MS-L0 structure", a lattice,
may be done using the dictionary and trying to align the tree and the selected trajectory with as few crossing liaisons as
possible. A central goal of this research is to merge approaches from pivot MT, interactive MT, and multilingual text
authoring.

satisfaisant, les erreurs ?taient probablement dues au graphe et non au d?convertisseur, et le graphe est envoy? aux

travail coop?ratif sur un m?me document est rendu possible. Du c?t? interne, des liaisons sont ?tablies entre des
?l?ments du texte et du graphe en utilisant des ressources largement disponibles comme un dictionnaire L0-anglais, ou
mieux L0-UNL, un analyseur morphosyntaxique de L0, et une transformation canonique de graphe UNL ? arbre. On
peut ?tablir une "meilleure" correspondance entre "l'arbre-UNL+L0" et la "structure MS-L0", une treille, en utilisant le
dictionnaire et en cherchant ? aligner l'arbre et une trajectoire avec aussi peu que possible de croisements de liaisons. Un
but central de cette recherche est de fusionner les approches de la TA par pivot, de la TA interactive, et de la g?n?ration
multilingue de texte.

Introduction
Creating and maintaining aligned multilingual
documents is a growing necessity. In the current
practice, a multilingual document consists in many
parallel monolingual files, which may be technical
documentation as well as help files, message files,
or simply thematic information put on the web and
intended for a multilingual audience (medicine,
cooking, travel?). The task is difficult even for a
document managed in a centralized manner.
Ususally, it is first created in a unique source
language, and translated into several target
languages. There must be a way to keep trak of
modifications, possibly done at various places on
different linguistic versions. From time to time,
somebody has to decide which modifications to
integrate in the next release of the document. For
that, modifications done in target languages have to
be translated back into the source language. The
new and the old source versions are then compared
using (fuzzy) matching techniques, so that only
really new segments are sent for translation.
The problem arises even more if the documents are
not managed centrally, so that the monolingual files
are often in various formats (Word, EgWord,
Interleaf, FileMaker, DBMS formats, etc.).
A. Assimi [1, 2] has shown how to "realign"
parallel decentralized documents and apply the
methodology sketched above. However, in both
cases, human translators have to retranslate the
modified or new source segments, or to revise them
if they are retranslated by a quality MT system.
Contrary to what is often said, quality MT exists,
but for specific contexts only. (See [14]).
What we would like to do is to make it possible to
share the revision work across languages, whatever
the domain and the context. It is clearly impossible
to reflect changes on a file in language L0 into files
in L1,? Ln automatically and faithfully, without
any intermediate structure to bridge the gap,
because that would necessitate at least a perfect
fine-grained aligner in case of changing articles or
common nouns (provided the gender and number
stay the ame in each Li version). In case of
replacing a verb by another with a different valency
frame in a target Li, the sentence in Li would have
to be reanalyzed, transformed accordingly, and
regenerated without introducing any new error or
imprecision, thereby keeping the manual
improvements coming from previous manual
revisions. Or we would need a more than perfect
MT system, namely one which would be able to
analyze the changed utterance in L0, and to transfer
and generate it into a sentence of Li as close as
possible as the previous sentence in Li, which again
could have been improved manually before.
The best and simplest way to go seems to use some
formalized interlingua IL and to
(1) reflect the modifications from L0 to the IL,
(2) regenerate into L1,? Ln from the IL.
We should also allow for direct manual
improvements, considering that the IL form will not
always be present, or not always improvable
enough for lack of expressivity, or that generators
will never be perfect. We choose UNL [3, 4, 10,
11] as our IL of choice for various reasons:
(1) it is specifically designed for linguistic and
semantic machine processing,
(2) it derives with many improvements from
H.Uchida's pivot used in ATLAS-II (Fujitsu)
[13], still evaluated as the best quality MT system
for English-Japanese, with a large coverage
(586,000 lexical entries in each language),
(3) participants of the UNL project1 have built
"deconverters" from UNL into about 12
languages, and at least the Arabic, Indonesian,
Italian, French, Russian, Spanish, and Thai

deconverters were accessible for experimentation
through a web interface at the time of writing,
(4) although formal, UNL graphs (see below) are
quite easy to understand with little training and
may be presented in a "localized" way to naive
users by translating UNL symbols (semantic
relations, attributes) and lexemes (UWs) into
symbols and lexemes of their language,
(5) the UNL project has defined a format embed-
ded in html for files containing a complete
multilingual document aligned at the level of
utterances, and produced a "visualizer" trans-
forming a UNL file into as many html files as
languages, and sending them to any web browser.
The UNL representation of a text is a list of
"semantic graphs", each expressing the meaning of
a natural language utterance. Nodes contain lexical
units and attributes, arcs bear semantic relations.
Connex subgraphs may be defined as "scopes", so
that a UNL graph may be a hypergraph.
The lexical units, called Universal Words (UW),
represent (sets of) word meanings, something less
ambitious than concepts. Their denotations are built
to be intuitively understood by developers knowing
English, that is, by all developers in NLP. AUW is
an English term or special symbol (number?)
possibly completed by semantic restrictions : the
UW "process" represents all word meanings of that
lemma, seen as citation form (verb or noun here),
and "process(icl>do, agt>person)" covers only the
meanings of processing, working on, etc.
The attributes are the (semantic) number, genre,
time, aspect, modality, etc., and the 40 or so
semantic relations are traditional "deep cases" such
as agent, (deep) object, location, goal, time, etc.
One way of looking at a UNL graph corresponding
to an utterance in language L is to say that it
represents the abstract structure of an equivalent
English utterance "seen from L", that is, where
semantic attributes not necessarily expressed in L
may be absent (e.g., aspect coming from French,
determination or number from Japanese, etc.).
We will first present scenarios of increasing internal
complexity for the situation where somebody reads
a UNL document in her language, corrects it, and
wants the corrections to carry over to the corres-
ponding fragment in other languages. We will then
study more precisely the correspondence between a
text in language L0 and its representation in UNL,
and show the advantage of breaking it into 3 parts:
text ? morpho-syntactic lattice or chart ? abstract
"UNL-tree" ? UNL graph. Finally, we present the
current status of this work: an experimentation web
site, a method to establish the second part of the
correspondence, and related research.
1 .  Scenarios for sharing revision across
languages
Suppose a collection of multilingual documents is
stored on a server as multilingual files in UNL-html
format, or in any other form, e.g. in a data base,
provided (1) it is possible to easily produce the
version in any language contained in the document,
(2) the versions are aligned at the level of utterance-
like segments (a segment may contain more than 1
utterance), (3) UNL-graphs may be stored and
aligned with the segments. Here is a slightly
simplified example of a file in UNL-html format.
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Example 1  El/UNL

Mein Hund bellte zu mir.{/de}

Mon chien aboya pour moi. [/S] [/P][/D]
</BODY></HTML>
The French versions have been produced
automatically, the German and Chinese manually.
The output of the UNL viewer for French is:
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>
Example 1  El/UNL
</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
J?ai couru dans le parc hier.
Mon chien aboya pour moi.
</BODY></HTML>
and will probably be displayed by a browser as:
Example 1  El/UNL
J?ai couru dans le parc hier. Mon chien aboya pour
moi.
and similarly for all other languages. In all
scenarios, the user is reading the text in the normal
display, not seing any tags, and wants to make some
modification, such as moving "hier" after "couru"
and changing "pour" to "vers". Activating some
button or menu item, she enters a revision interface.
1.1 Multiple revision without sharing
In this first scenario, we don't suppose that there are
UNL graphs associated with the segments. The
problem is to transmit and add the user's modifi-
cations to the original form of the multilingual
document. That is impossible by editing the html
documents displayed, because they have no links to
the original form. The UNL-html format predates
XML, hence the special tags like [S] and {unl}, but
we may transform it into an equivalent "UNL-xml"
format. Then, using DOM and javaScript, it is
possible to produce various views: that of a viewer,
a bilingual or multilingual editable presentation,
and a revision (coedition) interface.
This is an example from an experiment performed
for the "Forum Barcelona 2004" on Spanish,
Italian, Russian, French and Hindi.
Hindi and Russian are not shown, but
Japanese has been added by hand. The
XML form is simplified.
Correct sentences are produced by the
deconverters from correct and
complete UNL graphs. We suppose
here that the UNL graph has been
produced from a Chinese version, and
does not countain definiteness and
aspectual information. Now all results
are wrong wrt articles, and some wrt
aspect.

The following interface, designed to be used with sharing, may also be used by a reader knowing several
languages, displayed on demand.
For example, a
nat ive  Spanish
speaker knowing
French and English
would put the
correct articles ("La
ciudad", "La cit?",
"The city", etc.) and
the perfective as-
pect ("habra reco-
brado", "will have
recovered"), but a
native French spea-
ker would probably
not correct the
aspect in English

because aspect is
often underspecified
in French, e.g. in
"retrouvera".
