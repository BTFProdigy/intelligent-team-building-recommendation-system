Abstract
We report the results of our work on automat-
ing the transliteration decision of named en-
tities for English to Arabic machine trans-
lation. We construct a classification-based
framework to automate this decision, evalu-
ate our classifier both in the limited news and
the diverse Wikipedia domains, and achieve
promising accuracy. Moreover, we demon-
strate a reduction of translation error and
an improvement in the performance of an
English-to-Arabic machine translation sys-
tem.
1 Introduction
Translation of named entities (NEs) is important
for NLP applications such as Machine Translation
(MT) and Cross-lingual Information Retrieval. For
MT, NEs are major subset of the out-of-vocabulary
terms (OOVs). Due to their diversity, they cannot
always be found in parallel corpora, dictionaries or
gazetteers. Thus, state-of-the-art of MT needs to
handle NEs in specific ways. For instance, in the
English-Arabic automatic translation example given
in Figure 1, the noun ?North? has been erroneously
translated to ? ?J
?A?
??@ /Al$mAlyp ? (indicating the
north direction in English) instead of being translit-
erated to ? HP?	K / nwrv?.
As shown in Figure 1, direct translation of in-
vocabulary terms could degrade translation quality.
Also blind transliteration of OOVs does not neces-
sarily contribute to translation adequacy and may ac-
tually create noisy contexts for the language model
and the decoder.
