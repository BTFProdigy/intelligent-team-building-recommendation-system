Abstract
The present paper describes procedures to
visualise diachronic language changes in
academic discourse to support analysis.
These changes are reflected in the distri-
bution of different lexico-grammatical fea-
tures according to register. Findings about
register differences are relevant for both lin-
guistic applications (e.g., discourse analysis
and translation studies) and NLP tasks (no-
tably automatic text classification).
1 Introduction
The present paper describes procedures to visu-
alise diachronic language changes in academic
discourse with the aim to facilitate analysis
and interpretation of complex data. Diachronic
changes are reflected by linguistic features of reg-
isters under analysis. Registers are patterns of lan-
guage according to use in context, cf. (Halliday
and Hasan, 1989).
To analyse register change, we extract lexico-
grammatical features from a diachronic corpus of
academic English, and visualise our extraction re-
sults with Structured Parallel Coordinates (SPC),
a tool for the visualisation of structured multidi-
mensional data, cf. (Culy et al, 2011).
Our approach is based on the inspection and
comparison of how different features change over
time and registers. The major aim is to deter-
mine and describe tendencies of features, which
might become rarer, more frequent or cluster in
new ways. The amount and complexity of the in-
terrelated data, which is obtained for nine disci-
plines in two time periods (see section 2) makes
the analysis more difficult.
Structured Parallel Coordinates provide a tool
for the compact visual presentation of complex
data. The visualisation of statistical values for
different linguistic features laid out over time and
register supports data analysis as tendencies be-
come apparent. Furthermore, interactive features
allow for taking different views on the data and
focussing on interesting aspects.
2 Data to Analyse
2.1 Features and theoretical background
When defining lexico-grammatical features, we
refer to Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)
and register theory, e.g., (Quirk, 1985), (Halliday
and Hasan, 1989) and (Biber, 1995), which are
concerned with linguistic variation according to
contexts of use, typically distinguishing the three
contextual variables of field, tenor and mode of
discourse. Particular settings of these variables
are associated with the co-occurrences of certain
lexico-grammatical features, creating distinctive
registers (e.g., the language of linguistics in aca-
demic discourse). We also consider investiga-
tions of recent language change, observed, e.g.,
by (Mair, 2006), who analyses changes in prefer-
ences of lexico-grammatical selection in English
in the 1960s vs. the 1990s.
As a case study, we show an analysis of
modal verbs (falling into the contextual variable
of tenor), which we group according to (Biber,
1999) into three categories of meaning that rep-
resent three features: obligation, permission and
volition (see Table 1).
2.2 Resources
The selected features are extracted from SciTex,
cf. (Degaetano et al, 2012) and (Teich and
44
categories of meanings (feature) realisation
obligation/necessity (obligaton) can, could, may, etc.
permission/possibility/ability (permission) must, should, etc.
volition/prediction (volition) will, would, shall, etc.
Table 1: Categories of modal meanings for feature extraction
Fankhauser, 2010), an English corpus which con-
tains full English scientific journal articles from
nine disciplines (see Figure 1). The corpus covers
two time periods: the 1970/early 1980s (SaSci-
Tex) and the early 2000s (DaSciTex), and in-
cludes ca. 34 million tokens. Our focus is espe-
cially on the subcorpora representing contact reg-
isters, i.e. registers emerged out of register con-
tact, in our case with computer science: computa-
tional linguistics (B1), bioinformatics (B2), digi-
tal construction (B3), and microelectronics (B4).

Figure 1: Scientific disciplines in the SciTex corpus
SciTex is annotated1 with information on to-
ken, lemma, part-of-speech and sentence bound-
ary, as well as further information on text bound-
ary, register information, etc., and can be queried
in form of regular expressions by the Corpus
Query Processor (CQP), cf. (Evert, 2005).
2.3 Feature Extraction and Analysis
To extract the above described features for the two
time slices (1970/80s and 2000s) and for all nine
registers of SciTex, we elaborate queries, which
include both lexical (based on token and lemma
information) and grammatical (based on part-of-
speech or sentence boundary information) con-
straints.
1Annotations were obtained by means of a dedicated pro-
cessing pipeline (Kermes, 2011).
Annotations on the register information allow
us to sort the extracted material according to spe-
cific subcorpora. This enables the analysis of fea-
tures possibly involved in creating distinctive reg-
isters. Comparing differences and/or common-
alities in the distribution of features for A-B-C
triples of subcorpora (e.g., A-computer science,
B1-computational linguistics, C1-linguistics, cf.
Figure 1), we analyse whether the contact disci-
plines (B-subcorpora) are more similar to com-
puter science (A-subcorpus), the discipline of ori-
gin (C-subcorpus) or distinct from both (A and C).
The two time periods in SciTex (70/80s vs. 2000s)
enable a diachronic analysis. A more fine-grained
diachronic analysis is also possible with the infor-
mation on the publication year annotated in the
corpus.
3 Analysing language changes with SPC
3.1 SPC visualisation
Structured Parallel Coordinates (Culy et al, 2011)
are a specialisation of the Parallel Coordinates
visualisation (cf. (d?Ocagne, 1885), (Inselberg,
1985), (Inselberg, 2009)) for representing mul-
tidimensional data using a two-dimensional dis-
play. Parallel Coordinates place data on vertical
axes, with the axes lined up horizontally. Each
axis represents a separate data dimension and can
hold either categorical or numerical data. Data
points on different axes are related which is indi-
cated by colored lines connecting all data items
belonging to one record.
Targeted to the application to language data,
SPC additionally provide for ordered characteris-
tics of data within and across data dimensions. In
the n-grams with frequencies/KWIC2 implemen-
tations of SPC, ordered axes represent the linear
ordering of words in text.
In our analysis of language change based on
linguistic features, we are interested in two di-
rections of changes across data sets that can be
represented by ordering: changes over time and
2www.eurac.edu/linfovis
45
changes across registers, e.g., from linguistics and
computer science to computational linguistics.
3.2 Adjustments to SPC
For the analysis of linguistic features with SPC,
we start off with the n-grams with frequencies im-
plementation. In analyzing just two time dimen-
sions the ordered aspect of SPC is not as crucial
and a similar analysis could have been done with
Parallel Coordinates. However, the setup of n-
grams with frequencies conveniently provides us
with the combination of categorical and numerical
data dimensions in one display but separated visu-
ally. For our diachronic register analysis, we cre-
ate a subcorpus comparison application where the
feature under analysis as well as some of the cor-
pus data are placed on the unordered categorical
axes, and frequencies for the two time periods are
placed on ordered axes with numerical scales. As
shown in Figure 2 below, unordered dimensions
are followed by ordered dimensions, the inverse
situation to n-grams with frequencies. To visu-
ally support the categorical nature of data on the
first three axes, SPC was adjusted to display the
connecting lines in discrete colors instead of the
default color scale shading from red to blue. To
improve the comparability of values on numerical
axes, a function for switching between compara-
ble and individual scales was added that applies to
all axes right of the separating red line. Figure 2
and 3 present numerical values as percentages on
comparable scales scaled to 100.
3.3 Interactive features for analysis
SPC provide a number of interactive features that
support data analysis. To highlight and accentuate
selected parts of the data, an axis can be put into
focus and parts of axes can be selected. Lines are
colored according to the axis under focus, and fil-
ters apply to the selected portions of axes, with the
other data rendered in gray. Users can switch be-
tween discrete colors and scaled coloring of con-
necting lines. The scales of numerical axes can be
adjusted interactively, as described above. Hover-
ing over a determined connecting line brings it out
as a slightly wider line and gives a written sum-
mary of the values of that record.
4 Interpreting Visualisation Results
Visualised structures provided by SPC supply us
with information on development tendencies, and
thus, deliver valuable material for further interpre-
tation of language variation across registers and
time.
To analyse the frequencies of modal meanings
(see Table 1) for A-B-C triples of subcorpora, we
use the subcorpus comparison option of SPC. The
interactive functionality of SPC allows us to focus
on different aspects and provides us with dynam-
ically updated versions of the visualisation.
First, by setting focus on the axis of modal
meanings, the visualisation in Figure 2 shows di-
achronic changes of the modal meanings from the
1970/80s to the early 2000s. In both time periods
the permission (blue) meaning is most prominent
and has considerably increased over time. The
volition (green) and obligation (orange) meanings
are less prominent and we can observe a decrease
of volition and a very slight decrease of obliga-
tion.
Second, by setting the axis of the registers into
focus and selecting the disciplines one by one, we
can explore whether there are changes in the use
of modal meanings between the A register, the
contact registers (B), and the respective C regis-
ters. In Figure 3, for example, computer science
and biology have been selected (gray shaded) on
the ?disciplines? axis. For this selection, the struc-
tures starting from the ?registers? axis represent
(1) computer science (blue) being the A regis-
ter, (2) biology (green) from the C registers, and
(3) bioinformatics (orange) from the B registers
as the corresponding contact register. In terms
of register changes, Figure 3 shows that bioin-
formatics differs in the development tendencies
(a) of permission from biology and computer sci-
ence (less increase than the former, more increase
than the latter) and (b) of obligation from biology
(decrease for biology, whereas nearly stable for
bioinformatics and computer science).
5 Conclusion and Future Work
The results described above show that Structured
Parallel Coordinates provides us with a means for
the interactive inspection of complex data sets fa-
cilitating our diachronic register analysis. The vi-
sualisation allows to gain an overview and detect
tendencies by accomodating a complex set of data
in one display (nine registers over two time peri-
ods for three meanings).
The interactive features of SPC give the possi-
bility to put different aspects of the data into fo-

and biology (from C-subcorpus; green)
47
cus, and thus to successively zoom into specific
subsets of the data for detailed analyses. In this
way, we can determine general tendencies (e.g.,
increase of permission over time) or provide de-
tailed analyses for certain linguistic features and
registers by selecting subparts of the data and by
highlighting different data dimensions (e.g., com-
paring changes between different registers).
Future work comprises to use the data obtained
from the corpus to feed several different SPC vi-
sualisations. For example, the data presented in
Figure 2 can also be layed out to place values for
registers instead of values for time periods on the
numerical axes.
Future analyses will focus on inspecting fur-
ther tendencies in the feature development for the
three contextual variables mentioned in 2.1, e.g.,
verb valency patterns for field or conjunctive re-
lations expressing cohesion for mode. We also
aim at analysing several linguistic features at the
same time to possibly detect feature sets involved
in register variation of contact registers. Addition-
ally, a more fine-grained diachronic analysis ac-
cording to the publication years, which are anno-
tated in the corpus, might also prove to be useful.
From a technical point of view, the issue with
fully overlapping lines being displayed in one
color only will be tackled by experimenting with
semi-transparent or stacked lines. Furthermore,
SPC should in the future be expanded by a func-
tion for restructuring the underlying data to cre-
ate different layouts. This could also include the
merging of axes with categorical values (e.g., axes
registers and disciplines in Figure 2 above). Fur-
thermore on each data dimension a ?summary?
category could be introduced that would repre-
sent the sum of all individual values, and would
provide an extra point of reference for the analy-
sis. For interactive data analysis, support could be
provided to select data items based on crossings
or declination of their connecting lines.

Abstract
PAIS
`
A is a Creative Commons licensed,
large web corpus of contemporary Italian.
We describe the design, harvesting, and
processing steps involved in its creation.
1 Introduction
This paper provides an overview of the PAIS
`
A cor-
pus of Italian web texts and an introductory de-
scription of the motivation, procedures and facili-
ties for its creation and delivery.
Developed within the PAIS
`
A project, the cor-
pus is intended to meet the objective to help over-
come the technological barriers that still prevent
web users from making use of large quantities of
contemporary Italian texts for language and cul-
tural education, by creating a comprehensive and
easily accessible corpus resource of Italian.
The initial motivation of the initiative stemmed
from the awareness that any static repertoire of
digital data, however carefully designed and de-
veloped, is doomed to fast obsolescence, if con-
tents are not freely available for public usage, con-
tinuously updated and checked for quality, incre-
mentally augmented with new texts and annota-
tion metadata for intelligent indexing and brows-
ing. These requirements brought us to design a
resource that was (1) freely available and freely
re-publishable, (2) comprehensively covering con-
temporary common language and cultural content
and (3) enhanced with a rich set of automatically-
annotated linguistic information to enable ad-
vanced querying and retrieving of data. On top

of that, we set out to develop (4) a dedicated in-
terface with a low entry barrier for different target
groups. The end result of this original plan repre-
sents an unprecedented digital language resource
in the Italian scenario.
The main novelty of the PAIS
`
A web corpus is
that it exclusively draws on Creative Commons li-
censed data, provides advanced linguistic annota-
tions with respect to corpora of comparable size
and corpora of web data, and invests in a carefully
designed query interface, targeted at different user
groups. In particular, the integration of richly an-
notated language content with an easily accessible,
user-oriented interface makes PAIS
`
A a unique and
flexible resource for language teaching.
2 Related Work
The world wide web, with its inexhaustible
amount of natural language data, has become an
established source for efficiently building large
corpora (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). Tools
are available that make it convenient to bootstrap
corpora from the web based on mere seed term
lists, such as the BootCaT toolkit (Baroni and
Bernardini, 2004). The huge corpora created by
the WaCky project (Baroni et al., 2009) are an ex-
ample of such an approach.
A large number of papers have recently been
published on the harvesting, cleaning and pro-
cessing of web corpora.

able, large, contemporary, linguistically anno-
tated, easily accessible web corpora are still miss-

3 Corpus Composition
3.1 Corpus design
PAIS
`
A aimed at creating a comprehensive corpus
resource of Italian web texts which adheres to the
criteria laid out in section 1. For these criteria to
be fully met, we had to address a wide variety of
issues covering the entire life-cycle of a digital text
resource, ranging from robust algorithms for web
navigation and harvesting, to adaptive annotation
tools for advanced text indexing and querying and
user-friendly accessing and rendering online inter-
faces customisable for different target groups.
Initially, we targeted a size of 100M tokens, and
planned to automatically annotate the data with
lemma, part-of-speech, structural dependency, and
advanced linguistic information, using and adapt-
ing standard annotation tools (cf. section 4). In-
tegration into a querying environment and a dedi-
cated online interface were planned.
3.2 Licenses
A crucial point when planning to compile a cor-
pus that is free to redistribute without encounter-
ing legal copyright issues is to collect texts that are
in the public domain or at least, have been made
available in a copyleft regime. This is the case
when the author of a certain document decided to
share some rights (copy and/or distribute, adapt
etc.) on her work with the public, in a way that
end users do not need to ask permission to the cre-
ator/owner of the original work. This is possible
by employing licenses other than the traditional
?all right reserved? copyright, i.e. GNU, Creative
Commons etc., which found a wide use especially
on the web. Exploratory studies (Brunello, 2009)
have shown that Creative Commons licenses are
widely employed throughout the web (at least on
the Italian webspace), enough to consider the pos-
sibility to build a large corpus from the web ex-
clusively made of documents released under such
licenses.
In particular, Creative Commons provides five
basic ?baseline rights?: Attribution (BY), Share
Alike (SA), Non Commercial (NC), No Deriva-
tive Works (ND). The licenses themselves are
composed of at least Attribution (which can be
used even alone) plus the other elements, al-
lowing six different combinations:
3
(1) Attribu-
tion (CC BY), (2) Attribution-NonCommercial
3
For detailed descriptions of each license see http://
creativecommons.org/licenses/
(CC BY-NC), (3) Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-
SA), (4) Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND), (5)
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-
NC-SA), and (6) Attribution-NonCommercial-
NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND).
Some combinations are not possible because
certain elements are not compatible, e.g. Share
Alike and No Derivative Works. For our purposes
we decided to discard documents released with the
two licenses containing the No Derivative Works
option, because our corpus is in fact a derivative
work of collected documents.
3.3 The final corpus
The corpus contains approximately 388,000 docu-
ments from 1,067 different websites, for a total of
about 250M tokens. All documents contained in
the PAIS
`
A corpus date back to Sept./Oct. 2010.
The documents come from several web sources
which, at the time of corpus collection, provided
their content under Creative Commons license
(see section 3.2 for details). About 269,000 texts
are from Wikimedia Foundation projects, with
approximately 263,300 pages from Wikipedia,
2380 pages from Wikibooks, 1680 pages from
Wikinews, 740 pages from Wikiversity, 410 pages
from Wikisource, and 390 Wikivoyage pages.
The remaining 119,000 documents come
from guide.supereva.it (ca. 19,000),
italy.indymedia.org (ca. 10,000) and
several blog services from more than another
1,000 different sites (e.g. www.tvblog.it
(9,088 pages), www.motoblog.it (3,300),
www.ecowebnews.it (3,220), and
www.webmasterpoint.org (3,138).
Texts included in PAIS
`
A have an average length
of 683 words, with the longest text
4
counting
66,380 running tokens. A non exhaustive list of
average text lengths by source type is provided in
table 1 by way of illustration.
The corpus has been annotated for lemma, part-
of-speech and dependency information (see sec-
tion 4.2 for details). At the document level, the
corpus contains information on the URL of origin
and a set of descriptive statistics of the text, includ-
ing text length, rate of advanced vocabulary, read-
ability parameters, etc. (see section 4.3). Also,
each document is marked with a unique identifier.

4 Corpus Creation
4.1 Collecting and cleaning web data
The web pages for PAIS
`
A were selected in two
ways: part of the corpus collection was made
through CC-focused web crawling, and another
part through a targeted collection of documents
from specific websites.
4.1.1 Seed-term based harvesting
At the time of corpus collection (2010), we used
the BootCaT toolkit mainly because collecting
URLs could be based on the public Yahoo! search
API
5
, including the option to restrict search to CC-
licensed pages (including the possibility to specify
even the particular licenses). Unfortunately, Ya-
hoo! discontinued the free availability of this API,
and BootCaT?s remaining search engines do not
provide this feature.
An earlier version of the corpus was collected
using the tuple list originally employed to build
itWaC
6
. As we noticed that the use of this list, in
combination with the restriction to CC, biased the
final results (i.e. specific websites occurred very
often as top results) , we provided as input 50,000
medium frequent seed terms from a basic Italian
vocabulary list
7
, in order to get a wider distribu-
tion of search queries, and, ultimately, of texts.
As introduced in section 3.2, we restricted the

Results were downloaded and automatically
cleaned with the KrdWrd system, an environment
for the unified processing of web content (Steger
and Stemle, 2009).
Wrongly CC-tagged pages were eliminated us-
ing a black-list that had been manually populated
following inspection of earlier corpus versions.
4.1.2 Targeted
In September 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation de-
cided to release the content of their wikis under
CC BY-SA
8
, so we decided to download the large
and varied amount of texts made available through
the Italian versions of these websites. This was
done using the Wikipedia Extractor
9
on official
dumps
10
of Wikipedia, Wikinews, Wikisource,
Wikibooks, Wikiversity and Wikivoyage.
4.2 Linguistic annotation and tools
adaptation
The corpus was automatically annotated with
lemma, part-of-speech and dependency infor-
mation, using state-of-the-art annotation tools
for Italian. Part-of-speech tagging was per-
formed with the Part-Of-Speech tagger described
in Dell?Orletta (2009) and dependency-parsed by
the DeSR parser (Attardi et al., 2009), using Mul-
tilayer Perceptron as the learning algorithm. The
systems used the ISST-TANL part-of-speech
11
and dependency tagsets
12
. In particular, the pos-
tagger achieves a performance of 96.34% and
DeSR, trained on the ISST-TANL treebank con-
sisting of articles from newspapers and period-
icals, achieves a performance of 83.38% and
87.71% in terms of LAS (labelled attachment
score) and UAS (unlabelled attachment score) re-
spectively, when tested on texts of the same type.
However, since Gildea (2001), it is widely ac-
knowledged that statistical NLP tools have a drop
of accuracy when tested against corpora differing
from the typology of texts on which they were
trained. This also holds true for PAIS
`
A: it contains

lexical and syntactic structures of non-canonical
languages such as the language of social media,
blogs, forum posts, consumer reviews, etc. As re-
ported in Petrov and McDonald (2012), there are
multiple reasons why parsing the web texts is dif-
ficult: punctuation and capitalization are often in-
consistent, there is a lexical shift due to increased
use of slang and technical jargon, some syntactic
constructions are more frequent in web text than
in newswire, etc.
In order to overcome this problem, two main ty-
pologies of methods and techniques have been de-
veloped: Self-training (McClosky et al., 2006) and
Active Learning (Thompson et al., 1999).
For the specific purpose of the NLP tools adap-
tation to the Italian web texts, we adopted two dif-
ferent strategies for the pos-tagger and the parser.
For what concerns pos-tagging, we used an active
learning approach: given a subset of automatically
pos-tagged sentences of PAIS
`
A, we selected the
ones with the lowest likelihood, where the sen-
tence likelihood was computed as the product of
the probabilities of the assignments of the pos-
tagger for all the tokens. These sentences were
manually revised and added to the training corpus
in order to build a new pos-tagger model incor-
porating some new knowledge from the target do-
main.
For what concerns parsing, we used a self-
training approach to domain adaptation described
in Dell?Orletta et al. (2013), based on ULISSE
(Dell?Orletta et al., 2011). ULISSE is an unsu-
pervised linguistically-driven algorithm to select
reliable parses from a collection of dependency
annotated texts. It assigns to each dependency
tree a score quantifying its reliability based on a
wide range of linguistic features. After collect-
ing statistics about selected features from a cor-
pus of automatically parsed sentences, for each
newly parsed sentence ULISSE computes a reli-
ability score using the previously extracted feature
statistics. From the top of the parses (ranked ac-
cording to their reliability score) different pools of
parses were selected to be used for training. The
new training contains the original training set as
well as the new selected parses which include lex-
ical and syntactic characteristics specific of the tar-
get domain (Italian web texts). The parser trained
on this new training set improves its performance
when tested on the target domain.
We used this domain adaptation approach for
the following three main reasons: a) it is unsuper-
vised (i.e. no need for manually annotated training
data); b) unlike the Active Learning approach used
for pos-tagging, it does not need manual revision
of the automatically parsed samples to be used for
training; c) it was previously tested on Italian texts
with good results (Dell?Orletta et al., 2013).
4.3 Readability analysis of corpus documents
For each corpus document, we calculated several
text statistics indicative of the linguistic complex-
ity, or ?readability? of a text.
The applied measures include, (1) text length in
tokens, that is the number of tokens per text, (2)
sentences per text, that is a sentence count, and (3)
type-token ratio indicated as a percentage value.
In addition, we calculated (4) the advanced vo-
cabulary per text, that is a word count of the text
vocabulary which is not part of the the basic Ital-
ian vocabulary (?vocabolario di base?) for written
texts, as defined by De Mauro (1991)
13
, and (5)
the Gulpease Index (?Indice Gulpease?) (Lucisano
and Piemontese, 1988), which is a measure for the
readability of text that is based on frequency rela-
tions between the number of sentences, words and
letters of a text.
All values are encoded as metadata for the cor-
pus. Via the PAIS
`
A online interface, they can
be employed for filtering documents and building
subcorpora. This facility was implemented with
the principal target group of PAIS
`
A users in mind,
as the selection of language examples according
to their readability level is particularly relevant for
language learning and teaching.
4.4 Attempts at text classification for genre,
topic, and function
Lack of information about the composition of cor-
pora collected from the web using unsupervised
methods is probably one of the major limitations
of current web corpora vis-`a-vis more traditional,
carefully constructed corpora, most notably when
applications to language teaching and learning are
envisaged. This also holds true for PAIS
`
A, es-
13
The advanced vocabulary was calculated on the ba-
sis of a word list consisting of De Mauro?s ?vocabolario
fondamentale? (http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vocabolario_fondamentale) and ?vocabolario
di alto uso? (http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vocabolario_di_alto_uso), together with high
frequent function words not contained in those two lists.
39
pecially for the harvested
14
subcorpus that was
downloaded as described in section 4.1. We there-
fore carried out some experiments with the ulti-
mate aim to enrich the corpus with metadata about
text genre, topic and function, using automated
techniques.
In order to gain some insights into the com-
position of PAIS
`
A, we first conducted some man-
ual investigations. Drawing on existing literature
on web genres (e.g. (Santini, 2005; Rehm et al.,
2008; Santini et al., 2010)) and text classification
according to text function and topic (e.g. (Sharoff,
2006)), we developed a tentative three-fold taxon-
omy to be used for text classification. Following
four cycles of sample manual annotation by three
annotators, categories were adjusted in order to
better reflect the nature of PAIS
`
A?s web documents
(cf. (Sharoff, 2010) about differences between do-
mains covered in the BNC and in the web-derived
ukWaC). Details about the taxonomy are provided
in Borghetti et al. (2011). Then, we started to
cross-check whether the devised taxonomy was
indeed appropriate to describe PAIS
`
A?s composi-
tion by comparing its categories with data result-
ing from the application of unsupervised methods
for text classification.
Interesting insights have emerged so far re-
garding the topic category. Following Sharoff
(2010), we used topic modelling based on La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation for the detection of top-
ics: 20 clusters/topics were identified on the ba-
sis of keywords (the number of clusters to re-
trieve is a user-defined parameter) and projected
onto the manually defined taxonomy. This re-
vealed that most of the 20 automatically iden-
tified topics could be reasonably matched to
one of the 8 categories included in the tax-
onomy; exceptions were represented by clus-
ters characterised by proper nouns and gen-
eral language words such bambino/uomo/famiglia
(?child?/?man?/?family?) or credere/sentire/sperare
(?to believe?/?feel?/?hope?), which may in fact be
indicative of genres such as diary or personal com-
ment (e.g. personal blog). Only one of the cate-
gories originally included in the taxonomy ? natu-
ral sciences ? was not represented in the clusters,
which may indicate that there are few texts within
PAIS
`
A belonging to this domain. One of the ma-
14
In fact, even the nature of the targeted texts is not pre-
cisely defined: for instance, Wikipedia articles can actually
encompass a variety of text types such as biographies, intro-
ductions to academic theories etc. (Santini et al., 2010, p. 15)
jor advantages of topic models is that each corpus
document can be associated ? to varying degrees ?
to several topics/clusters: if encoded as metadata,
this information makes it possible not only to fil-
ter texts according to their prevailing domain, but
also to represent the heterogeneous nature of many
web documents.
5 Corpus Access and Usage
5.1 Corpus distribution
The PAIS
`
A corpus is distributed in two ways: it is
made available for download and it can be queried
via its online interface. For both cases, no restric-
tions on its usage apply other than those defined
by the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. For
corpus download, both the raw text version and the
annotated corpus in CoNLL format are provided.
The PAIS
`
A corpus together with all project-
related information is accessible via the project
web site at http://www.corpusitaliano.it
5.2 Corpus interface
The creation of a dedicated open online interface
for the PAIS
`
A corpus has been a declared primary
objective of the project.
The interface is aimed at providing a power-
ful, effective and easy-to-employ tool for mak-
ing full use of the resource, without having to go
through downloading, installation or registration
procedures. It is targeted at different user groups,
particularly language learners, teachers, and lin-
guists. As users of PAIS
`
A are expected to show
varying levels of proficiency in terms of language
competence, linguistic knowledge, and concern-
ing the use of online search tools, the interface
has been designed to provide four separate search
components, implementing different query modes.
Initially, the user is directed to a basic keyword
search that adopts a ?Google-style? search box.
Single search terms, as well as multi-word combi-
nations or sequences can be searched by inserting
them in a simple text box.
The second component is an advanced graph-
ical search form. It provides elaborated search
options for querying linguistic annotation layers
and allows for defining distances between search
terms as well as repetitions or optionally occurring
terms. Furthermore, the advanced search supports
regular expressions.
The third component emulates a command-line
search via the powerful CQP query language of
40
the Open Corpus Workbench (Evert and Hardie,
2011). It allows for complex search queries in
CQP syntax that rely on linguistic annotation lay-
ers as well as on metadata information.
Finally, a filter interface is presented in a fourth
component. It serves the purpose of retriev-
ing full-text corpus documents based on keyword
searches as well as text statistics (see section 4.3).
Like the CQP interface, the filter interface is also
supporting the building of temporary subcorpora
for subsequent querying.
By default, search results are displayed as
KWIC (KeyWord In Context) lines, centred
around the search expression. Each search hit can
be expanded to its full sentence view. In addition,
the originating full text document can be accessed
and its source URL is provided.
Based on an interactive visualisation for depen-
dency graphs (Culy et al., 2011) for each search
result a graphical representations of dependency
relations together with the sentence and associated
lemma and part-of-speech information can be gen-
erated (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: Dependency diagram
Targeted at novice language learners of Italian,
a filter for automatically restricting search results
to sentences of limited complexity has been in-
tegrated into each search component. When ac-
tivated, search results are automatically filtered
based on a combination of the complexity mea-
sures introduced in section 4.3.
5.3 Technical details
The PAIS
`
A online interface has been developed in
several layers: in essence, it provides a front-end
to the corpus as indexed in Open Corpus Work-
bench (Evert and Hardie, 2011). This corpus
query engine provides the fundamental search ca-
pabilities through the CQP language. Based on
the CWB/Perl API that is part of the Open Corpus
Workbench package, a web service has been de-
veloped at EURAC which exposes a large part of
the CQP language
15
through a RESTful API.
16
The four types of searches provided by the on-
line interface are developed on top of this web ser-
vice. The user queries are translated into CQP
queries and passed to the web service. In many
cases, such as the free word order queries in the
simple and advanced search forms, more than one
CQP query is necessary to produce the desired
result. Other functionalities implemented in this
layer are the management of subcorpora and the
filtering by complexity. The results returned by
the web service are then formatted and presented
to the user.
The user interface as well as the mechanisms
for translation of queries from the web forms into
CQP have been developed server-side in PHP.
The visualizations are implemented client-side in
JavaScript and jQuery, the dependency graphs
based on the xLDD framework (Culy et al., 2011).
5.4 Extraction of lexico-syntactic information
PAIS
`
A is currently used in the CombiNet project
?Word Combinations in Italian ? Theoretical and
descriptive analysis, computational models, lexi-
cographic layout and creation of a dictionary?.
17
The project goal is to study the combinatory prop-
erties of Italian words by developing advanced
computational linguistics methods for extracting
distributional information from PAIS
`
A.
In particular, CombiNet uses a pattern-based
approach to extract a wide range of multiword
expressions, such as phrasal lexemes, colloca-
tions, and usual combinations. POS n-grams
are automatically extracted from PAIS
`
A, and then
ranked according to different types of associa-
tion measures (e.g., pointwise mutual informa-
tion, log-likelihood ratios, etc.). Extending the
LexIt methodology (Lenci et al., 2012), CombiNet
also extracts distributional profiles from the parsed
layer of PAIS
`
A, including the following types of
information:
1. syntactic slots (subject, complements, modi-
15
To safeguard the system against malicious attacks, secu-
rity measures had to be taken at several of the layers, which
unfortunately also make some of the more advanced CQP fea-
tures inaccessible to the user.
16
Web services based on REST (Representational State
Transfer) principles employ standard concepts such as a URI
and standard HTTP methods to provide an interface to func-
tionalities on a remote host.
17
3-year PRIN(2010/2011)-project, coordination by Raf-
faele Simone ? University of Rome Tre
41
fiers, etc.) and subcategorization frames;
2. lexical sets filling syntactic slots (e.g. proto-
typical subjects of a target verb);
3. semantic classes describing selectional pref-
erences of syntactic slots (e.g. the direct obj.
of mangiare/?to eat? typically selects nouns
referring to food, while its subject selects an-
imate nouns); semantic roles of predicates.
The saliency and typicality of combinatory pat-
terns are weighted by means of different statisti-
cal indexes and the resulting profiles will be used
to define a distributional semantic classification of
Italian verbs, comparable to the one elaborated in
the VerbNet project (Kipper et al., 2008).
6 Evaluation
We performed post-crawl evaluations on the data.
For licensing, we analysed 200,534 pages that
were originally collected for the PAIS
`
A corpus,
and only 1,060 were identified as containing no
CC license link (99.95% with CC mark-up). Then,
from 10,000 randomly selected non-CC-licensed
Italian pages 15 were wrongly identified as CC li-
censed containing CC mark-up (0.15% error). For
language identification we checked the harvested
corpus part with the CLD2 toolkit
18
, and > 99%
of the data was identified as Italian.
The pos-tagger has been adapted to peculiari-
ties of the PAIS
`
A web texts, by manually correct-
ing sample annotation output and re-training the
tagger accordingly. Following the active learning
approach as described in section 4.2 we built a new
pos-tagger model based on 40.000 manually re-
vised tokens. With the new model, we obtained
an improvement in accuracy of 1% on a test-set
of 5000 tokens extracted from PAIS
`
A. Final tag-
ger accuracy reached 96.03%.
7 Conclusion / Future Work
In this paper we showed how a contemporary and
free language resource of Italian with linguistic
annotations can be designed, implemented and de-
veloped from the web and made available for dif-
ferent types of language users.
Future work will focus on enriching the cor-
pus with metadata by means of automatic clas-
sification techniques, so as to make a better as-
sessment of corpus composition. A multi-faceted
18
Compact Language Detection 2, http://code.
google.com/p/cld2/
approach combining linguistic features extracted
from texts (content/function words ratio, sentence
length, word frequency, etc.) and information
extracted from document URLs (e.g., tags like
?wiki?, ?blog?) might be particularly suitable for
genre and function annotation.
Metadata annotation will enable more advanced
applications of the corpus for language teaching
and learning purposes. In this respect, existing
exemplifications of the use of the PAIS
`
A inter-
face for language learning and teaching (Lyding et
al., 2013) could be followed by further pedagogi-
cal proposals as well as empowered by dedicated
teaching guidelines for the exploitation of the cor-
pus and its web interface in the class of Italian as
a second language.
In a more general perspective, we envisage
a tighter integration between acquisition of new
texts, automated text annotation and development
of lexical and language learning resources allow-
ing even non-specialised users to carve out and
develop their own language data. This ambitious
goal points in the direction of a fully-automatised
control of the entire life-cycle of open-access Ital-
ian language resources with a view to address an
increasingly wider range of potential demands.
