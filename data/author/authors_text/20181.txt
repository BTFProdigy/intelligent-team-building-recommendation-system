Abstract
We present a human judgments dataset
and an adapted metric for evaluation of
Arabic machine translation. Our medium-
scale dataset is the first of its kind for Ara-
bic with high annotation quality. We use
the dataset to adapt the BLEU score for
Arabic. Our score (AL-BLEU) provides
partial credits for stem and morphologi-
cal matchings of hypothesis and reference
words. We evaluate BLEU, METEOR and
AL-BLEU on our human judgments cor-
pus and show that AL-BLEU has the high-
est correlation with human judgments. We
are releasing the dataset and software to
the research community.
1 Introduction
Evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) contin-
ues to be a challenging research problem. There
is an ongoing effort in finding simple and scal-
able metrics with rich linguistic analysis. A wide
range of metrics have been proposed and evaluated
mostly for European target languages (Callison-
Burch et al., 2011; Mach?a?cek and Bojar, 2013).
These metrics are usually evaluated based on their
correlation with human judgments on a set of MT
output. While there has been growing interest in
building systems for translating into Arabic, the
evaluation of Arabic MT is still an under-studied
problem. Standard MT metrics such as BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002) or TER (Snover et al., 2006)
have been widely used for evaluating Arabic MT
(El Kholy and Habash, 2012). These metrics use
strict word and phrase matching between the MT
output and reference translations. For morpholog-
ically rich target languages such as Arabic, such
criteria are too simplistic and inadequate. In this
paper, we present: (a) the first human judgment
dataset for Arabic MT (b) the Arabic Language
BLEU (AL-BLEU), an extension of the BLEU
score for Arabic MT evaluation.
Our annotated dataset is composed of the output
of six MT systems with texts from a diverse set of
topics. A group of ten native Arabic speakers an-
notated this corpus with high-levels of inter- and
intra-annotator agreements. Our AL-BLEU met-
ric uses a rich set of morphological, syntactic and
lexical features to extend the evaluation beyond
the exact matching. We conduct different exper-
iments on the newly built dataset and demonstrate
that AL-BLEU shows a stronger average correla-
tion with human judgments than the BLEU and
METEOR scores. Our dataset and our AL-BLEU
metric provide useful testbeds for further research
on Arabic MT and its evaluation.

2 Related Work
Several studies on MT evaluation have pointed out
the inadequacy of the standard n-gram based eval-
uation metrics for various languages (Callison-
Burch et al., 2006). For morphologically complex
languages and those without word delimiters, sev-
eral studies have attempted to improve upon them
and suggest more reliable metrics that correlate
better with human judgments (Denoual and Lep-
age, 2005; Homola et al., 2009).
A common approach to the problem of mor-
phologically complex words is to integrate some
linguistic knowledge in the metric. ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), TER-
Plus (Snover et al., 2010) incorporate limited lin-
guistic resources. Popovi?c and Ney (2009) showed
that n-gram based evaluation metrics calculated on
POS sequences correlate well with human judg-
ments, and recently designed and evaluated MPF,
a BLEU-style metric based on morphemes and
POS tags (Popovi?c, 2011). In the same direc-

tion, Chen and Kuhn (2011) proposed AMBER,
a modified version of BLEU incorporating re-
call, extra penalties, and light linguistic knowl-
edge about English morphology. Liu et al. (2010)
propose TESLA-M, a variant of a metric based
on n-gram matching that utilizes light-weight lin-
guistic analysis including lemmatization, POS tag-
ging, and WordNet synonym relations. This met-
ric was then extended to TESLA-B to model
phrase synonyms by exploiting bilingual phrase
tables (Dahlmeier et al., 2011). Tantug et al.
(2008) presented BLEU+, a tool that implements
various extension to BLEU computation to allow
for a better evaluation of the translation perfor-
mance for Turkish.
To the best of our knowledge the only human
judgment dataset for Arabic MT is the small cor-
pus which was used to tune parameters of the ME-
TEOR metric for Arabic (Denkowski and Lavie,
2011). Due to the shortage of Arabic human judg-
ment dataset, studies on the performance of eval-
uation metrics have been constrained and limited.
A relevant effort in this area is the upper-bound es-
timation of BLEU and METEOR scores for Ara-
bic MT output (El Kholy and Habash, 2011). As
part of its extensive functionality, the AMEANA
system provides the upper-bound estimate by an
exhaustive matching of morphological and lexical
features between the hypothesis and the reference
translations. Our use of morphological and lex-
ical features overlaps with the AMEANA frame-
work. However, we extend our partial matching
to a supervised tuning framework for estimating
the value of partial credits. Moreover, our human
judgment dataset allows us to validate our frame-
work with a large-scale gold-standard data.
3 Human judgment dataset
We describe here our procedure for compiling a
diverse Arabic MT dataset and annotating it with
human judgments.
3.1 Data and systems
We annotate a corpus composed of three datasets:
(1) the standard English-Arabic NIST 2005 cor-
pus, commonly used for MT evaluations and com-
posed of news stories. We use the first English
translation as the source and the single corre-
sponding Arabic sentence as the reference. (2) the
MEDAR corpus (Maegaard et al., 2010) that con-
sists of texts related to the climate change with
four Arabic reference translations. We only use
the first reference in this study. (3) a small dataset
of Wikipedia articles (WIKI) to extend our cor-
pus and metric evaluation to topics beyond the
commonly-used news topics. This sub-corpus
consists of our in-house Arabic translations of
seven English Wikipedia articles. The articles are:
Earl Francis Lloyd, Western Europe, Citizenship,
Marcus Garvey, Middle Age translation, Acadian,
NBA. The English articles which do not exist in
the Arabic Wikipedia were manually translated by
a bilingual linguist.
Table 1 gives an overview of these sub-corpora
characteristics.
NIST MEDAR WIKI
# of Documents 100 4 7
# of Sentences 1056 509 327
Table 1: Statistics on the datasets.
We use six state-of-the-art English-to-Arabic
MT systems. These include four research-oriented
phrase-based systems with various morphological
and syntactic features and different Arabic tok-
enization schemes and also two commercial off-
the-shelf systems.
3.2 Annotation of human judgments
In order conduct a manual evaluation of the six
MT systems, we formulated it as a ranking prob-
lem. We adapt the framework used in the WMT
2011 shared task for evaluating MT metrics on
European language pairs (Callison-Burch et al.,
2011) for Arabic MT. We gather human ranking
judgments by asking ten annotators (each native
speaker of Arabic with English as a second lan-
guage) to assess the quality of the English-Arabic
systems, by ranking sentences relative to each
other, from the best to the worst (ties are allowed).
We use the Appraise toolkit (Federmann, 2012)
designed for manual MT evaluation. The tool dis-
plays to the annotator, the source sentence and
translations produced by various MT systems. The
annotators received initial training on the tool and
the task with ten sentences. They were presented
with a brief guideline indicating the purpose of the
task and the main criteria of MT output evaluation.
Each annotator was assigned to 22 ranking
tasks. Each task included ten screens. Each screen
involveed ranking translations of ten sentences. In
total, we collected 22, 000 rankings for 1892 sen-
208
tences (22 tasks?10 screens?10 judges). In each
annotation screen, the annotator was shown the
source-language (English) sentences, as well as
five translations to be ranked. We did not provide
annotators with the reference to avoid any bias in
the annotation process. Each source sentence was
presented with its direct context. Rather than at-
tempting to get a complete ordering over the sys-
tems, we instead relied on random selection and a
reasonably large sample size to make the compar-
isons fair (Callison-Burch et al., 2011).
An example of a source sentence and its five
translations to be ranked is given in Table 2.
3.3 Annotation quality and analysis
In order to ensure the validity of any evaluation
setup, a reasonable of inter- and intra-annotator
agreement rates in ranking should exist. To mea-
sure these agreements, we deliberately reassigned
10% of the tasks to second annotators. More-
over, we ensured that 10% of the screens are re-
displayed to the same annotator within the same
task. This procedure allowed us to collect reliable
quality control measure for our dataset.

Table 3: Inter- and intra-annotator agreement
scores for our annotation compared to the aver-
age scores for five English to five European lan-
guages and also English-Czech (Callison-Burch et
al., 2011).
We measured head-to-head pairwise agreement
among annotators using Cohen?s kappa (?) (Co-
hen, 1968), defined as follows:
? =
P (A)? P (E)
1? P (E)
where P(A) is the proportion of times annotators
agree and P(E) is the proportion of agreement by
chance.
Table 3 gives average values obtained for inter-
annotator and intra-annotator agreement and com-
pare our results to similar annotation efforts in
WMT-13 on different European languages. Here
we compare against the average agreement for En-
glish to five languages and also from English to
one morphologically rich language (Czech).

Based on Landis and Koch (1977) ? interpre-
tation, the ?
inter
value (57%) and also compar-
ing our agreement scores with WMT-13 annota-
tions, we believe that we have reached a reliable
and consistent annotation quality.
4 AL-BLEU
Despite its well-known shortcomings (Callison-
Burch et al., 2006), BLEU continues to be the
de-facto MT evaluation metric. BLEU uses an
exact n-gram matching criterion that is too strict
for a morphologically rich language like Arabic.
The system outputs in Table 2 are examples of
how BLEU heavily penalizes Arabic. Based on
BLEU, the best hypothesis is from Sys
5
which has
three unigram and one bigram exact matches with
the reference. However, the sentence is the 4
th
ranked by annotators. In contrast, the output of
Sys
3
(ranked 1
st
by annotators) has only one ex-
act match, but several partial matches when mor-
phological and lexical information are taken into
consideration.
We propose the Arabic Language BLEU (AL-
BLEU) metric which extends BLEU to deal with
Arabic rich morphology. We extend the matching
to morphological, syntactic and lexical levels with
an optimized partial credit. AL-BLEU starts with
the exact matching of hypothesis tokens against
the reference tokens. Furthermore, it considers the
following: (a) morphological and syntactic feature
matching, (b) stem matching. Based on Arabic lin-
guistic intuition, we check the matching of a sub-
set of 5 morphological features: (i) POS tag, (ii)
gender (iii) number (iv) person (v) definiteness.
We use the MADA package (Habash et al., 2009)
to collect the stem and the morphological features
of the hypothesis and reference translation.
Figure 1 summarizes the function in which we
consider partial matching (m(t
h
, t
r
)) of a hypoth-
esis token (t
h
) and its associated reference token
(t
r
). Starting with the BLEU criterion, we first
check if the hypothesis token is same as the ref-
erence one and provide the full credit for it. If
the exact matching fails, we provide partial credit
for matching at the stem and morphological level.
The value of the partial credits are the sum of
the stem weight (w
s
) and the morphological fea-

Abstract
This paper describes the system we sub-
mitted to the SemEval-2014 shared task
on sentiment analysis in Twitter. Our sys-
tem is a hybrid combination of two system
developed for a course project at CMU-
Qatar. We use an SVM classifier and cou-
ple a set of features from one system with
feature and parameter optimization frame-
work from the second system. Most of the
tuning and feature selection efforts were
originally aimed at task-A of the shared
task. We achieve an F-score of 84.4% for
task-A and 62.71% for task-B and the sys-
tems are ranked 3rd and 29th respectively.
1 Introduction
With the proliferation of Web2.0, people increas-
ingly express and share their opinion through so-
cial media. For instance, microblogging websites
such as Twitter
1
are becoming a very popular com-
munication tool. An analysis of this platform re-
veals a large amount of community messages ex-
pressing their opinions and sentiments on differ-
ent topics and aspects of life. This makes Twit-
ter a valuable source of subjective and opinionated
text that could be used in several NLP research
works on sentiment analysis. Many approaches
for detecting subjectivity and determining polarity
of opinions in Twitter have been proposed (Pang
and Lee, 2008; Davidov et al., 2010; Pak and
Paroubek, 2010; Tang et al., 2014). For instance,
the Twitter sentiment analysis shared task (Nakov
et al., 2013) is an interesting testbed to develop
and evaluate sentiment analysis systems on social
media text. Participants are asked to implement

a system capable of determining whether a given
tweet expresses positive, negative or neutral sen-
timent. In this paper, we describe the CMUQ-
Hybrid system we developed to participate in the
two subtasks of SemEval 2014 Task 9 (Rosenthal
et al., 2014). Our system uses an SVM classifier
with a rich set of features and a parameter opti-
mization framework.
2 Data Preprocessing
Working with tweets presents several challenges
for NLP, different from those encountered when
dealing with more traditional texts, such as
newswire data. Tweet messages usually contain
different kinds of orthographic and typographical
errors such as the use of special and decorative
characters, letter duplication used generally for
emphasis, word duplication, creative spelling and
punctuation, URLs, #hashtags as well as the use
of slangs and special abbreviations. Hence, before
building our classifier, we start with a preprocess-
ing step on the data, in order to normalize it. All
letters are converted to lower case and all words
are reduced to their root form using the WordNet
Lemmatizer in NLTK
2
(Bird et al., 2009). We kept
only some punctuation marks: periods, commas,
semi-colons, and question and exclamation marks.
The excluded characters were identified to be per-
formance boosters using the best-first branch and
bound technique described in Section 3.
3 Feature Extraction
Out of a wide variety of features, we selected the
most effective features using the best-first branch
and bound method (Neapolitan, 2014), a search
tree technique for solving optimization problems.
We used this technique to determine which punc-
tuation marks to keep in the preprocessing step and
2

html

in selecting features as well. In the feature selec-
tion step, the root node is represented by a bag of
words feature, referred as textual tokens.
At each level of the tree, we consider a set of
different features, and iteratively we carry out the
following steps: we process the current feature by
generating its successors, which are all the other
features. Then, we rank features according to the
f-score and we only process the best feature and
prune the rest. We pass all the current pruned fea-
tures as successors to the next level of the tree. The
process iterates until all partial solutions in the tree
are processed or terminated. The selected features
are the following:
Sentiment lexicons : we used the Bing Liu Lex-
icon (Hu and Liu, 2004), the MPQA Subjectivity
Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), and NRC Hashtag
Sentiment Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013). We
count the number of words in each class, result-
ing in three features: (a) positive words count, (b)
negative words count and (c) neutral words count.
Negative presence: presence of negative words
in a term/tweet using a list of negative words. The
list used is built from the Bing Liu Lexicon (Hu
and Liu, 2004).
Textual tokens: the target term/tweet is seg-
mented into tokens based on space. Token identity
features are created and assigned the value of 1.
Overall polarity score: we determine the polar-
ity scores of words in a target term/tweet using the
Sentiment140 Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013)
and the SentiWordNet lexicon (Baccianella et al.,
2010). The overall score is computed by adding
up all word scores.
Level of association: indicates whether the
overall polarity score of a term is greater than 0.2
or not. The threshold value was optimized on the
development set.
Sentiment frequency: indicates the most fre-
quent word sentiment in the tweet. We determine
the sentiment of words using an automatically
generated lexicon. The lexicon comprises 3,247
words and their sentiments. Words were obtained
from the provided training set for task-A and sen-
timents were generated using our expression-level
classifier.
We used slightly different features for Task-A
and Task-B. The features extracted for each task
are summarized in Table 1.
Feature Task A Task B
Positive words count X
Negative words count X
Neutral words count X
Negative presence X X
Textual tokens X X
Overall polarity score X X
Level of association X
Sentiment frequency X
Table 1: Feature summary for each task.
4 Modeling Kernel Functions
Initially we experimented with both logistic
regression and the Support Vector Machine
(SVM) (Fan et al., 2008), using the Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for parame-
ter optimization. In our development experiments,
SVM outperformed and became our single classi-
fier. We used the LIBSVM package (Chang and
Lin, 2011) to train and test our classifier.
An SVM kernel function and associated param-
eters were optimized for best F-score on the de-
velopment set. In order to avoid the model over-
fitting the data, we select the optimal parameter
value only if there are smooth gaps between the
near neighbors of the corresponded F-score. Oth-
erwise, the search will continue to the second op-
timal value.
In machine learning, the difference between the
number of training samples, m, and the number
of features, n, is crucial in the selection process
of SVM kernel functions. The Gaussian kernel is
suggested when m is slightly larger than n. Other-
wise, the linear kernel is recommended. In Task-
B, the n : m ratio was 1 : 3 indicating a large
difference between the two numbers. Whereas in
Task-A, a ratio of 5 : 2 indicated a small differ-
ence between the two numbers. We selected the
theoretical types, after conducting an experimen-
tal verification to identify the best kernel function
according to the f-score.
We used a radical basis function kernel for the
expression-level task and the value of its gamma
parameter was adjusted to 0.319. Whereas, we
used a linear function kernel for the message-level
task and the value of its cost parameter was ad-
justed to 0.053.

5 Experiments and Results
In this section, we describe the data and the sev-
eral experiments we conducted for both tasks. We
train and evaluate our classifier with the training,
development and testing datasets provided for the
SemEval 2014 shared task. A short summary of
the data distribution is shown in Table 2.
Dataset Postive Negative Neutral
Task-A:
Train (9,451) 62% 33% 5%
Dev (1,135) 57% 38% 5%
Test (10,681) 60% 35% 5%
Task-B:
Train (9,684) 38% 15% 47%
Dev (1,654) 35% 21% 44%
Test (5,754) 45% 15% 40%
Table 2: Datasets distribution percentage per class.
Our test dataset is composed of five different
sets: The test dataset is composed of five dif-
ferent sets: Twitter2013 a set of tweets collected
for the SemEval2013 test set, Twitter2014, tweets
collected for this years version, LiveJournal2014
consisting of formal tweets, SMS2013, a collection
of sms messages, TwitterSarcasm, a collection of
sarcastic tweets.
5.1 Task-A
For this task, we train our classifier on 10,586
terms (9,451 terms in the training set and 1,135
in the development set), tune it on 4,435 terms,
and evaluate it using 10,681 terms. The average
F-score of the positive and negative classes for
each dataset is given in the first part of Table 3.
The best F-score value of 88.94 is achieved on the
Twitter2013.
We conducted an ablation study illustrated in
the second part of Table 3 shows that all the se-
lected features contribute well in our system per-
formance. Other than the textual tokens feature,
which refers to a bag of preprocessed tokens, the
study highlights the role of the term polarity score
feature: ?4.20 in the F-score, when this feature is
not considered on the TwitterSarcasm dataset.
Another study conducted is a feature correlation
analysis, in which we grouped features with sim-
ilar intuitions. Namely the two features negative
presence and negative words count are grouped
as ?negative features?, and the features positive
words count and negative words count are grouped
as ?words count?. We show in Table 4 the effect
on f-score after removing each group from the fea-
tures set. Also we show the f-score after remov-
ing each individual feature within the group. This
helps us see whether features within a group are
redundant or not. For the Twitter2014 dataset, we
notice that excluding one of the features in any of
the two groups leads to a significant drop, in com-
parison to the total drop by its group. The uncor-
related contributions of features within the same
group indicate that features are not redundant to
each other and that they are indeed capturing dif-
ferent information. However, in the case of the
TwitterSarcasm dataset, we observe that the neg-
ative presence feature is not only not contributing
to the system performance but also adding noise
to the feature space, specifically, to the negative
words count feature.
5.2 Task-B
For this task, we trained our classifier on 11,338
tweets (9,684 terms in the training set and 1,654
in the development set), tuned it on 3,813 tweets,
and evaluated it using 8,987 tweets. Results for
different feature configurations are reported in Ta-
ble 5.
It is important to note that if we exclude the tex-
tual tokens feature, all datasets benefit the most
from the polarity score feature. It is interesting to
note that the bag of words, referred to as textual
tokens, is not helping in one of the datasets, the
TwitterSarcasm set. For all datasets, performance
could be improved by removing different features.
In Table 5, we observe that the Negative pres-
ence feature decreases the F-score on the Twitter-
Sarcasm dataset. This could be explained by the
fact that negative words do not usually appear in
a negative implication in sarcastic messages. For
example, this tweet: Such a fun Saturday catch-
ing up on hw. which has a negative sentiment, is
classified positive because of the absence of neg-
ative words. Table 5 shows that the textual tokens
feature increases the classifier?s performance up to
+21.07 for some datasets. However, using a large
number of features in comparison to the number
of training samples could increase data sparseness
and lower the classifier?s performance.
We conducted a post-competition experiment to
examine the relationship between the number of
features and the number of training samples. We

fixed the size of our training dataset. Then, we
compared the performance of our classifier using
only the bag of tokens feature, in two different
sizes. In the first experiment, we included all to-
kens collected from all tweets. In the second, we
only considered the top 20 ranked tokens from
each tweet. Tokens were ranked according to the
difference between their highest level of associa-
tion into one of the sentiments and the sum of the
rest. The level of associations for tokens were de-
termined using the Sentiment140 and SentiWord-
Net lexicons. The threshold number of tokens was
identified empirically for best performance. We
found that the classifier?s performance has been
improved by 2 f-score points when the size of to-
kens bag is smaller. The experiment indicates that
the contribution of the bag of words feature can be
increased by reducing the size of vocabulary list.
6 Error Analysis
Our efforts are mostly tuned towards task-A,
hence our inspection and analysis is focused on
task-A. The error rate calculated per sentiment
class: positive, negative and neutral are 6.8%,
14.9% and 93.8%, respectively. The highest error
rate in the neutral class, 93.8%, is mainly due to
the few neutral examples in the training data (only
5% of the data). Hence the system could not learn
from such a small set of neutral class examples.
In the case of negative class error rate, 14.9%,
most of which were classified as positive. An ex-
ample of such classification: I knew it was too
good to be true OTL. Since our system highly re-
lies on lexicon, hence looking at lexicon assigned
polarity to the phrase too good to be true which is
positive, happens because the positive words good
and true has dominating positive polarity.
Lastly for the positive error rate, which is rel-
atively lower, 6%, most of which were classified
negative instead of positive. An example of such
classification: Looks like we?re getting the heavi-
est snowfall in five years tomorrow. Awesome. I?ll
never get tired of winter. Although the phrase car-
ries a positive sentiment, the individual negative
words of the phrase never and tired again domi-
nates over the phrase.
7 Conclusion
We described our systems for Twitter Sentiment
Analysis shared task. We participated in both
tasks, but were mostly focused on task-A. Our hy-
brid system was assembled by integrating a rich
set of lexical features into a framework of fea-
ture selection and parameter tuning, The polarity

score feature was the most important feature for
our model in both tasks. The F-score results were
consistent across all datasets, except the Twitter-
Sarcasm dataset. It indicates that feature selection
and parameter tuning steps were effective in gen-
eralizing the model to unseen data.
