Abstract
Populating Knowledge Base (KB) with
new knowledge facts from reliable text re-
sources usually consists of linking name
mentions to KB entities and identifying
relationship between entity pairs. How-
ever, the task often suffers from errors
propagating from upstream entity linkers
to downstream relation extractors. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint infer-
ence framework to allow interactions be-
tween the two subtasks and find an opti-
mal assignment by addressing the coher-
ence among preliminary local predictions:
whether the types of entities meet the ex-
pectations of relations explicitly or implic-
itly, and whether the local predictions are
globally compatible. We further measure
the confidence of the extracted triples by
looking at the details of the complete ex-
traction process. Experiments show that
the proposed framework can significantly
reduce the error propagations thus obtain
more reliable facts, and outperforms com-
petitive baselines with state-of-the-art re-
lation extraction models.
1 Introduction
Recent advances in natural language processing
have made it possible to construct structured KBs
from online encyclopedia resources, at an un-
precedented scale and much more efficiently than
traditional manual edit. However, in those KBs,
entities which are popular to the community usu-
ally contain more knowledge facts, e.g., the bas-
ketball player LeBron James, the actor Nicholas
Cage, etc., while most other entities often have
fewer facts. On the other hand, knowledge facts
should be updated as the development of entities,
such as changes in the cabinet, a marriage event,
or an acquisition between two companies, etc.
In order to address the above issues, we could
consult populating existing KBs from reliable text
resources, e.g., newswire, which usually involves
enriching KBs with new entities and populating
KBs with new knowledge facts, in the form of
<Entity, Relation, Entity> triple. In this paper, we
will focus on the latter, identifying relationship be-
tween two existing KB entities. This task can be
intuitively considered in a pipeline paradigm, that
is, name mentions in the texts are first linked to
entities in the KB (entity linking, EL), and then
the relationship between them are identified (re-
lation extraction, RE). It is worth mentioning that
the first task EL is different from the task of named
entity recognition (NER) in traditional informa-
tion extraction (IE) tasks, where NER recognizes
and classifies the entity mentions (to several pre-
defined types) in the texts, but EL focuses on link-
ing the mentions to their corresponding entities in
the KB. Such pipeline systems often suffer from
errors propagating from upstream to downstream,
since only the local best results are selected to the
next step. One idea to solve the problem is to allow
interactions among the local predictions of both
subtasks and jointly select an optimal assignment
to eliminate possible errors in the pipeline.
Let us first look at an example. Suppose we are
extracting knowledge facts from two sentences in
Figure 1: in sentence [1], if we are more confi-
dent to extract the relation fb:org.headquarters
1
,
we will be then prompted to select Bryant Univer-
sity, which indeed favors the RE prediction that
requires an organization to be its subject. On
the other side, if we are sure to link to Kobe
Bryant in sentence [2], we will probably select
fb:pro athlete.teams, whose subject position ex-
pects an athlete, e.g., an NBA player. It is not dif-
ficult to see that the argument type expectations of
relations can encourage the two subtasks interact
with each other and select coherent predictions for

both of them. In KBs with well-defined schemas,
such as Freebase, type requirements can be col-
lected and utilized explicitly (Yao et al., 2010).
However, in other KBs with less reliable or even
no schemas, it is more appropriate to implicitly
capture the type expectations for a given relation
(Riedel et al., 2013).
Furthermore, previous RE approaches usually
process each triple individually, which ignores
whether those local predictions are compatible
with each other. For example, suppose the local
predictions of the two sentences above are <Kobe
Bryant, fb:org.headquarters, Smithfield, Rhode Is-
land> and <Kobe Bryant, fb:pro athlete.teams,
Los Angeles Lakers>, respectively, which, in fact,
disagree with each other with respect to the KB,
since, in most cases, these two relations cannot
share subjects. Now we can see that either the re-
lation predictions or the EL results for ?Bryant?
are incorrect. Those disagreements provide us an
effective way to remove the possible incorrect pre-
dictions that cause the incompatibilities.
On the other hand, the automatically extracted
knowledge facts inevitably contain errors, espe-
cially for those triples collected from open do-
main. Extractions with confidence scores will be
more than useful for users to make proper deci-
sions according to their requirements, such as trad-
ing recall for precision, or supporting approximate
queries.
In this paper, we propose a joint framework to
populate an existing KB with new knowledge facts
extracted from reliable text resources. The joint
framework is designed to address the error propa-
gation issue in a pipeline system, where subtasks
are optimized in isolation and locally. We find an
optimal configuration from top k results of both
subtasks, which maximizes the scores of each step,
fulfills the argument type expectations of relations,
which can be captured explicitly or implicitly, in
the KB, and avoids globally incoherent predic-
tions. We formulate this optimization problem in
an Integer Linear Program (ILP) framework, and
further adopt a logistic regression model to mea-
sure the reliability of the whole process, and assign
confidences to all extracted triples to facilitate fur-
ther applications. The experiments on a real-world
case study show that our framework can elimi-
nate error propagations in the pipeline systems by
taking relations? argument type expectations and
global compatibilities into account, thus outper-
forms the pipeline approaches based on state-of-
the-art relation extractors by a large margin. Fur-
thermore, we investigate both explicit and implicit
type clues for relations, and provide suggestions
about which to choose according to the character-
istics of existing KBs. Additionally, our proposed
confidence estimations can help to achieve a pre-
cision of over 85% for a considerable amount of
high quality extractions.
In the rest of the paper, we first review related
work and then define the knowledge base popula-
tion task that we will address in this paper. Next
we detail the proposed framework and present our
experiments and results. Finally, we conclude this
paper with future directions.
2 Related Work
Knowledge base population (KBP), the task of ex-
tending existing KBs with entities and relations,
has been studied in the TAC-KBP evaluations (Ji et
al., 2011), containing three tasks. The entity link-
ing task links entity mentions to existing KB nodes
and creates new nodes for the entities absent in the
current KBs, which can be considered as a kind
of entity population (Dredze et al., 2010; Tamang
et al., 2012; Cassidy et al., 2011). The slot-filling
task populates new relations to the KB (Tamang
et al., 2012; Roth et al., 2012; Liu and Zhao,
2012), but the relations are limited to a predefined
sets of attributes according to the types of enti-
ties. In contrast, our RE models only require min-
imal supervision and do not need well-annotated
training data. Our framework is therefore easy to
adapt to new scenarios and suits real-world appli-
cations. The cold-start task aims at constructing a
KB from scratch in a slot-filling style (Sun et al.,
2012; Monahan and Carpenter, 2012).
Entity linking is a crucial part in many KB re-
1913
lated tasks. Many EL models explore local con-
texts of entity mentions to measure the similarity
between mentions and candidate entities (Han et
al., 2011; Han and Sun, 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011;
Cheng and Roth, 2013). Some methods further ex-
ploit global coherence among candidate entities in
the same document by assuming that these enti-
ties should be closely related (Han et al., 2011;
Ratinov et al., 2011; Sen, 2012; Cheng and Roth,
2013). There are also some approaches regarding
entity linking as a ranking task (Zhou et al., 2010;
Chen and Ji, 2011). Lin et al. (2012) propose an
approach to detect and type entities that are cur-
rently not in the KB.
Note that the EL task in KBP is different from
the name entity mention extraction task, mainly
in the ACE task style, which mainly identifies the
boundaries and types of entity mentions and does
not explicitly link entity mentions into a KB (ACE,
2004; Florian et al., 2006; Florian et al., 2010; Li
and Ji, 2014), thus are different from our work.
Meanwhile, relation extraction has also been
studied extensively in recent years, ranging from
supervised learning methods (ACE, 2004; Zhao
and Grishman, 2005; Li and Ji, 2014) to unsuper-
vised open extractions (Fader et al., 2011; Carl-
son et al., 2010). There are also models, with dis-
tant supervision (DS), utilizing reliable texts re-
sources and existing KBs to predict relations for a
large amount of texts (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et
al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al.,
2012). These distantly supervised models can ex-
tract relations from texts in open domain, and do
not need much human involvement. Hence, DS is
more suitable for our task compared to other tradi-
tional RE approaches.
Joint inference over multiple local models has
been applied to many NLP tasks. Our task is dif-
ferent from the traditional joint IE works based in
the ACE framework (Singh et al., 2013; Li and
Ji, 2014; Kate and Mooney, 2010), which jointly
extract and/or classify named entity mentions to
several predefined types in a sentence and iden-
tify in a sentence level which relation this specific
sentence describes (between a pair of entity men-
tions in this sentence). Li and Ji (2014) follow
the ACE task definitions and present a neat incre-
mental joint framework to simultaneously extract
entity mentions and relations by structure percep-
tron. In contrast, we link entity mentions from a
text corpus to their corresponding entities in an ex-
isting KB and identify the relations between pairs
of entities based on that text corpus. Choi et al.
(2006) jointly extracts the expressions and sources
of opinion as well as the linking relations (i.e., a
source entity expresses an opinion expression) be-
tween them, while we focus on jointly modeling
EL and RE in open domain, which is a different
and challenging task.
Since the automatically extracted knowledge
facts inevitably contain errors, many approaches
manage to assign confidences for those extracted
facts (Fader et al., 2011; Wick et al., 2013). Wick
et al. (2013) also point out that confidence estima-
tion should be a crucial part in the automated KB
constructions and will play a key role for the wide
applications of automatically built KBs. We thus
propose to model the reliability of the complete
extraction process and take the argument type ex-
pectations of the relation, coherence with other
predictions and the triples in the existing KB into
account for each populated triple.
3 Task definition
We formalize our task as follows. Given a set
of entities sampled from an existing KB, E =
{e
1
, e
2
, ..., e
|E|
}, a set of canonicalized relations
from the same KB, R = {r
1
, r
2
, ..., r
|R|
}, a set
of sentences extracted from news corpus, SN =
{sn
1
, sn
2
, ..., sn
|SN |
}, each contains two men-
tions m
1
and m
2
whose candidate entities belong
to E, a set of text fragments T = {t
1
, t
2
, ..., t
|T |
},
where t
i
contains its corresponding target sentence
sn
i
and acts as its context. Our task is to link those
mentions to entities in the given KB, identify the
relationship between entity pairs and populate new
knowledge facts into the KB.
4 The Framework
We propose to perform joint inference over sub-
tasks involved. For each sentence with two entity
mentions, we first employ a preliminary EL model
and RE model to obtain entity candidates and pos-
sible relation candidates between the two men-
tions, respectively. Our joint inference framework
will then find an optimal assignment by taking the
preliminary prediction scores, the argument type
expectations of relations and the global compati-
bilities among the predictions into account. In the
task of KBP, an entity pair may appear in multiple
sentences as different relation instances, and the
crucial point is whether we can identify all the cor-

rect relations for an entity pair. Thus, after finding
an optimal sentence-level assignment, we aggre-
gate those local predictions by ORing them into
the entity pair level. Finally, we employ a regres-
sion model to capture the reliability of the com-
plete extraction process.
4.1 Preliminary Models
Entity Linking The preliminary EL model can
be any approach which outputs a score for each
entity candidate. Note that a recall-oriented model
will be more than welcome, since we expect to in-
troduce more potentially correct local predictions
into the inference step. In this paper, we adopt
an unsupervised approach in (Han et al., 2011)
to avoid preparing training data. Note the chal-
lenging NIL problem, i.e., identifying which en-
tity mentions do not have corresponding entities
in the KB (labeled as NIL) and clustering those
mentions, will be our future work. For each men-
tion we retain the entities with top p scores for the
succeeding inference step.
Relation Extraction The choice of RE model is
also broad. Any sentence level extractor whose
results are easy to be aggregated to entity pair
level can be utilized here (again, a recall-oriented
version will be welcome), such as Mintz++ men-
tioned in (Surdeanu et al., 2012), which we adapt
into a Maximum Entropy version. We also include
a special label, NA, to represent the case where
there is no predefined relationship between an en-
tity pair. For each sentence, we retain the relations
with top q scores for the inference step, and we
also call that this sentence supports those candi-
date relations. As for the features of RE models,
we use the same features (lexical features and syn-
tactic features) with the previous works (Chen et
al., 2014; Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010;
Hoffmann et al., 2011).
4.2 Relations? Expectations for Argument
Types
In most KBs? schemas, canonicalized relations are
designed to expect specific types of entities to be
their arguments. For example, in Figure 2, it is
more likely that an entity Kobe Bryant takes the
subject position of a relation fb:pro athlete.teams,
but it is unlikely for this entity to take the subject
position of a relation fb:org.headquarters. Making
use of these type requirements can encourage the
framework to select relation and entity candidates
which are coherent with each other, and discard
incoherent choices.
In order to obtain the preference scores between
1915
the entities in E and the relations in R, we gener-
ate two matrices with |E| rows and |R| columns,
whose elements sp
ij
indicates the preference score
of entity i and relation j. The matrix S
subj
is for
relations and their subjects, and the matrix S
obj
is
for relations and their objects. We initialize the
two matrices using the KB as follows: for entity i
and relation j, if relation j takes entity i as its sub-
ject/object in the KB, the element at the position
(i, j) of the corresponding matrix will be 1, oth-
erwise it will be 0. Note that in our experiments,
we do not count the triples that are evaluated in the
testing data, to build the matrices. Now the prob-
lem is how we can obtain the unknown elements
in the matrices.
Explicit Type Information Intuitively, we
should examine whether the explicit types of the
entities fulfill the expectations of relations in the
KB. For each unknown element S
subj
(i, j), we
first obtain the type of entity i, which is collected
from the lowest level of the KB?s type hierarchy,
and examine whether there is another entity
with the same type taking the subject position
of relation j in the initial matrix. If such an
entity exists, S
subj
(i, j) = 1, otherwise 0. For
example, for the subject Jay Fletcher Vincent and
the relation fb:pro athlete.teams, we first obtain
the subject?s type basketball player, and then we
go through the initial matrix and find another
entity Kobe Bryant with the same type taking
the subject position of fb:pro athlete.teams,
indicating that Jay Fletcher Vincent may take the
relation fb:pro athlete.teams. The matrix S
obj
is
processed in the same way.
Implicit Type Expectations In practice, few
KBs have well-defined schemas. In order to make
our framework more flexible, we need to come up
with an approach to implicitly capture the rela-
tions? type expectations, which will also be rep-
resented as preference scores.
Inspired by Riedel et al. (2013) who use a ma-
trix factorization approach to capture the associa-
tion between textual patterns, relations and entities
based on large text corpora, we adopt a collabora-
tive filtering (CF) method to compute the prefer-
ence scores between entities and relations based
on the statistics obtained from an existing KB.
In CF, the preferences between customers and
items are calculated via matrix factorization over
the initial customer-item matrix. In our frame-
work, we compute the preference scores between
entities and relations via the same approach over
the two initialized matrices S
subj
and S
obj
, re-
sulting in two entity-relation matrices with esti-
mated preference values. We use ALS-WR (Zhou
et al., 2008) to process the matrices and compute
the preference of a relation taking an entity as its
subject and object, respectively. We normalize the
preference scores of each entity using their means
? and standard deviations ?.
4.3 Compatibilities among Predicted Triples
The second aspect we investigate is whether the
extracted triples are compatible with respect to all
other knowledge facts. For example, according to
the KB, the two relations fb:org.headquarters and
fb:pro athlete.teams in Figure 2 cannot share the
same entity as their subjects. So if such sharing
happens, that will indicate either the predictions
of the relations or the entities are incorrect. The
clues can be roughly grouped into three categories,
namely whether two relations can share the same
subjects, whether two relations can share the same
objects, and whether one relation?s subject can be
the other relation?s object.
Global compatibilities among local predictions
have been investigated by several joint models (Li
et al., 2011; Li and Ji, 2014; Chen et al., 2014) to
eliminate the errors propagating in a pipeline sys-
tem. Specifically, Chen et al. (2014) utilized the
clues with respect to the compatibilities of rela-
tions in the task of relation extraction. Following
(Li et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014), we extend the
idea of global compatibilities to the entity and re-
lation predictions during knowledge base popula-
tion. We examine the pointwise mutual informa-
tion (PMI) between the argument sets of two re-
lations to collect such clues. For example, if we
want to learn whether two relations can share the
same subject, we first collect the subject sets of
both relations from the KB, and then compute the
PMI value between them. If the value is lower
than a certain threshold (set to -3 in this paper), the
clue that the two relations cannot share the same
subject is added. These clues can be easily inte-
grated into an optimization framework in the form
of constraints.
4.4 Integer Linear Program Formulation
Now we describe how we aggregate the above
components, and formulate the joint inference
problem into an ILP framework. For each candi-
1916
date entity e of mention m in text fragment t, we
define a boolean decision variable d
m,e
t
, which de-
notes whether this entity is selected into the final
configuration or not. Similarly, for each candidate
relation r of fragment t, we define a boolean de-
cision variable d
r
t
. In order to introduce the pref-
erence scores into the model, we also need a deci-
sion variable d
r,m,e
t
, which denotes whether both
relation r and candidate entity e of mention m are
selected in t.
We use s
t,m,e
el
to represent the score of mention
m in t disambiguated to entity e, which is output
by the EL model, s
t,r
re
representing the score of re-
lation r assigned to t, which is output by the RE
model, s
r,e
p
the explicit/implicit preference score
between relation r and entity e.
Our goal is to find the best assignment to the
variables d
r
t
and d
m,e
t
, such that it maximizes the
overall scores of the two subtasks and the co-
herence among the preliminary predictions, while
satisfying the constraints between the predicted
triples as well. Our objective function can be writ-
ten as:
max el? conf
ent
+ re? conf
rel
+ sp? coh
e?r
(1)
where el, re and sp are three weighting parameters
tuned on development set. conf
ent
is the overall
score of entity linking:
conf
ent
=
?
t
?
m?M(t)
?
e?C
e
(m)
s

el
d
m,e
t
(2)
where M(t) is the set of mentions in t, C
e
(m) is
the candidate entity set of the mention m. conf
rel
represents the overall score of relation extraction:
conf
rel
=
?
t
?
r?C
r
(t)
s
t,r
re
d
r
t
(3)
where C
r
(t) is the set of candidate relations in t.
coh
e?r
is the coherence between the candidate re-
lations and entities in the framework:
coh
e?r
=
?
t
?
r?C
r
(t)
?
m?M(t)
?
e?C
e
(m)
s
r,e
p
d
r,m,e
t
(4)
Now we describe the constraints used in our ILP
problem. The first kind of constraints is intro-
duced to ensure that each mention should be dis-
ambiguated to only one entity:
?t,?m ?M(t),
?
e?C
e
(m)
d
m,e
t
? 1 (5)
The second type of constraints ensure that each en-
tity mention pair in one sentence can only take one
relation label:
?t,
?
r?C
r
(t)
d
t
r
? 1 (6)
The third is introduced to ensure the decision vari-
able d
r,m,e
t
equals 1 if and only if both the corre-
sponding variables d
r
t
and d
m,e
t
equal 1.
?t,?r ? C
r
(t), ?m ?M(t),?e ? C
e
(m)
d
r,m,e
t
? d
r
t
(7)
d
r,m,e
t
? d
m,e
t
(8)
d
r
t
+ d
m,e
t
? d
r,m,e
t
+ 1 (9)
As for the compatibility constraints, we need to
introduce another type of boolean decision vari-
ables. If a mention m
1
in t
1
and another mention
m
2
in t
2
share an entity candidate e, we add a vari-
able y for this mention pair, which equals 1 if and
only if both d
m
1
,e
t
1
and d
m
2
,e
t
2
equal 1. So we add
the following constraints for each mention pairm
1
and m
2
satisfies the previous condition:
y ? d
m
1
,e
t
1
(10)
y ? d
m
2
,e
t
2
(11)
d
m
1
,e
t
1
+ d
m
2
,e
t
2
? y + 1 (12)
Then we further add the following constraints for
each mention pair to avoid incompatible predic-
tions:
?r
1
? C
r
(t
1
), r
2
? C
r
(t

)
If (r

If (r

4.5 Confidence Estimation for Extracted
Triples
The automatically extracted triples inevitably con-
tain errors and are often considered as with high
recall but low precision. Since our aim is to pop-
ulate the extracted triples into an existing KB,
which requires highly reliable knowledge facts,
we need a measure of confidence for those ex-
tracted triples, so that others can properly utilize
them.
Here, we use a logistic regression model to mea-
sure the reliability of the process, how the entities
are disambiguated, how the relationships are iden-
tified, and whether those predictions are compat-
ible. The features we used are listed in Table 1,
which are all efficiently computable and indepen-
dent from specific relations or entities. We manu-
ally annotate 1000 triples as correct or incorrect to
prepare the training data.
5 Experiments
We evaluate the proposed framework in a real-
world scenario: given a set of news texts with en-
tity mentions and a KB, a model should find more
and accurate new knowledge facts between pairs
of those entities.
5.1 Dataset
We use New York Times dataset from 2005 to
2007 as the text corpus, and Freebase as the KB.
We divide the corpus into two equal parts, one for
creating training data for the RE models using the
distant supervision strategy (we do not need train-
ing data for EL), and the other as the testing data.
For the convenience of experimentation, we ran-
domly sample a subset of entities for testing. We
first collect all sentences containing two mentions
which may refer to the sampled entities, and prune
them according to: (1)there should be no more
than 10 words between the two mentions; (2)the
prior probability of the mention referring to the
target entity is higher than a threshold (set to 0.1
in this paper), which is set to filter the impossi-
ble mappings; (3)the mention pairs should not be-
long to different clauses. The resulting test set is
split into 10 parts and a development set, each with
3500 entity pairs roughly, which leads to averagely
200,000 variables and 900,000 constraints per split
and may take 1 hour for Cplex to solve. Note that
we do not count the triples that will be evaluated
in the testing data when we learn the preferences
and the clues from the KB.
5.2 Experimental Setup
We compare our framework with three baselines.
The first one, ME-pl, is the pipeline system con-
structed by the entity linker in (Han et al., 2011)
and the MaxEnt version of Mintz++ extractor
mentioned in (Surdeanu et al., 2012). The sec-
ond and third baselines are the pipeline systems
constructed by the same linker and two state-of-
the-art DS approaches, MultiR (Hoffmann et al.,
2011) and MIML-RE (Surdeanu et al., 2012), re-
spectively. They are referred to as MultiR-pl and
MIML-pl in the rest of this paper.
We also implement several variants of our
framework to investigate the following two com-
ponents in our framework: whether to use ex-
plicit (E) or implicit (I) argument type expecta-
tions, whether to take global (G) compatibilities
into account, resulting in four variants: ME-JE,
ME-JI, ME-JEG, ME-JIG.
We tune the parameters in the objective func-
tion on the development set to be re = 1, el = 4,
sp = 1. The numbers of preliminary results re-
tained to the inference step are set to p = 2, q = 3.
Three metrics used in our experiments include:
(1)the precision of extracted triples, which is the
ratio of the number of correct triples and the num-
ber of total extracted triples; (2)the number of cor-
rect triples (NoC); (3)the number of correct triples
in the results ranked in top n. The third metric
is crucial for KBP, since most users are only in-
terested in the knowledge facts with high confi-
dences. We compare the extracted triples against
1918

the three baselines.

Freebase to compute the precision, which may un-
derestimate the performance since Freebase is in-
complete. Since we do not have exact annotations
for the EL, it is difficult to calculate the exact re-
call. We therefore use NoC instead. We evalu-
ate our framework on the 10 subsets of the testing
dataset and compute their means and standard de-
viations.
5.3 Overall Performance
We are interested to find out: (a)whether the task
benefits from the joint inference i.e., can we col-
lect more and correct facts? Or with a higher pre-
cision? (b) whether the argument type expecta-
tions (explicit and implicit) and global compati-
bility do their jobs as we expected? And, how do
we choose from these components ? (c)whether
the framework can work with other RE models?
(d)whether we can find a suitable approach to
measure the confidence or uncertainty during the
extraction so that users or other applications can
better utilize the extracted KB facts?
Let us first look at the performance of the
baselines and our framework in Table 2 for an
overview. Comparing the three pipeline sys-
tems, we can discover that using the same en-
tity linker, MIML-pl performs the best in precision
with slightly fewer correct triples, while ME-pl
performs the worst. It is not surprising, ME-pl, as
a strong and high-recall baseline, outputs the most
correct triples. As for the results with high confi-
dences, MultiR-pl outputs more correct triples in
the top 50 results than ME-pl, and MIML-pl per-
forms better or comparable than ME-pl in top n
results.
After performing the joint inference, ME-JE
improves ME-pl with 4.1% in precision and 43
more correct triples averagely, and results in bet-
ter performance in top n results. By taking global
compatibilities into consideration, ME-JEG fur-
ther improve the precision to 34.2% in average
with slightly fewer correct triples, indicating that

both argument type expectations and global com-
patibilities are useful in improving the perfor-
mance: argument type information can help to
select the correct and coherent predictions from
the candidates EL and RE outputs, while global
compatibilities can further prune incorrect triples
that cause disagreements, although a few correct
ones may be incorrectly eliminated. We can also
observe that ME-JIG performs even higher than
ME-JEG in overall precision, but ME-JEG col-
lects more correct triples than ME-JIG in the top
n predictions, showing that explicit type expec-
tations with more accurate type information may
perform better in high confidence results.
Furthermore, even though MultiR-pl and
MIML-pl are based on state-of-the-art RE ap-
proaches, our model (for example, ME-JIG) can
still outperform them in terms of all metrics, with
4.7% higher in precision than MultiR-pl, 2.5%
higher than MIML-pl. Our model can extract 125
more correct triples than MultiR-pl, 164 more
than MIML-pl, and perform better in top n results
as well.
In previous RE tasks, Precision-Recall curves
are mostly used to evaluate the systems? perfor-
mances. In our task, since it is difficult to calculate
the recall exactly, we use the number of correct
triples instead, and plot curves of Precision-NoC
to show the performance of the competitors and
our approaches in more detail. For each value of
NoC, the precision is the average of the ten splits
of the testing dataset.
As shown in Figure 3, our approaches (ME-JEG
and ME-JIG) obtain higher precisions on each
NoC value, and the curves are much smoother than
1919

MultiR-pl 31.0? 0.8 647? 15 39? 2 71? 3
MultiR-JEG 36.9? 0.8 687? 15 46? 2 88? 3
MultiR-JIG 38.5? 0.9 700? 15 45? 2 88? 3
the pipeline systems, indicating that our frame-
work is more suitable for harvesting high quality
knowledge facts. Comparing the two kinds of type
clues, we can see that explicit ones perform better
when the confidence control is high and the num-
ber of correct triples is small, and then the two are
comparable. Since the precision of the triples with
high confidences is crucial for the task of KBP,
we still suggest choosing the explicit ones when
there is a well-defined schema available in the KB,
although implicit type expectations can result in
higher overall precision.
5.4 Adapting MultiR Sentence Extractor into
the Framework
The preliminary relation extractor of our frame-
work is not limited to the MaxEnt
3
extractor. It
can be any sentence level recall-oriented relation
extractors. To further investigate the generaliza-
tion of our joint inference framework, we also
try to fit other sentence level relation extractors
into the framework. Considering that MIML-RE
does not output sentence-level results, we only
adapt MultiR, with both global compatibilities
and explicit/implicit type expectations, named as
MultiR-JEG and MultiR-JIG, respectively. Since
the scores output by the original MultiR are un-
normalized, which are difficult to directly apply to
our framework, we normalize their scores and re-
tune the framework?s parameters accordingly. The
parameters are set to re = 1, el = 32, sp = 16.
As seen in Table 3, MultiR-JEG helps MultiR
obtain about 40 more correct triples in average,
and achieves 5.9% higher in precision, as well
as significant improvements in top n correct pre-
dictions. As for MultiR-JIG, the improvements
are 7.5% in precision and 53 in number of cor-
rect triples. In terms of top n results, the explicit
and implicit type expectations perform compara-
ble. We also observe that our framework improves
MultiR as much as it does to MaxEnt, indicating
our joint framework can generalize well in differ-
ent RE models.

We further plot Precision-NoC curves for
MultiR-JEG and MultiR-JIG in Figure 4, show-
ing that our framework can result in better perfor-
mance and smoother curves with MultiR extractor.
It is interesting to see that with MultiR extractor,
the two kinds of expectations perform comparably.
5.5 Results with Confidence Estimations
Now, we will investigate the results from another
perspective with the help of confidence estima-
tions. We calculate the precisions of the competi-
tors and our approaches on different confidence
thresholds from 0.5 to 1. The results are summa-
rized in Figure 5. Note that the results across dif-
ferent approaches are not directly comparable, we
put them in the same figure only to save space.
In Figure 5, intuitively, as the confidence thresh-
old goes up, the extraction precisions should
increase, indicating triples with higher confi-
dences are more likely to be correct. However,
1920
lower thresholds tend to result in estimations with
smaller standard derivations due to those preci-
sions are estimated over much more triples than
those with higher thresholds, which means the ran-
domness will be smaller.
On the other hand, our joint frameworks pro-
vide more evidences that can be used to well cap-
ture the reliability of an extraction. For example,
the precisions of Multir-JIG and ME-JIG both stay
around 85% when the confidence is higher than
0.85, with about 120 correct triples, indicating that
by setting a proper threshold, we can obtain con-
siderable amount of high quality knowledge facts
at an acceptable precision, which is crucial for
KBP. However, we cannot harvest such amount of
high quality knowledge facts from the other three
pipeline systems.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a joint framework for the
task of populating KBs with new knowledge facts,
which performs joint inference on two subtasks,
maximizes their preliminary scores, fulfills the
type expectations of relations and avoids global
incompatibilities with respect to all local predic-
tions to find an optimal assignment. Experimen-
tal results show that our framework can signifi-
cantly eliminate the error propagations in pipeline
systems and outperforms competitive pipeline sys-
tems with state-of-the-art RE models. Regard-
ing the explicit argument type expectations and
the implicit ones, the latter can result in a higher
overall precision, while the former performs bet-
ter in acquiring high quality knowledge facts with
higher confidence control, indicating that if the
KB has a well-defined schema we can use explicit
type requirements for the KBP task, and if not,
our model can still perform well by mining the
implicit ones. Our framework can also generalize
well with other preliminary RE models. Further-
more, we assign extraction confidences to all ex-
tracted facts to facilitate further applications. By
setting a suitable threshold, our framework can
populate high quality reliable knowledge facts to
existing KBs.
For future work, we will address the NIL is-
sue of EL where we currently assume all entities
should be linked to a KB. It would be also inter-
esting to jointly model the two subtasks through
structured learning, instead of joint inference only.
Currently we only use the coherence of extracted
triples and the KB to estimate confidences, which
would be nice to directly model the issue in a joint
model.

Abstract
Most existing relation extraction models
make predictions for each entity pair lo-
cally and individually, while ignoring im-
plicit global clues available in the knowl-
edge base, sometimes leading to conflicts
among local predictions from different en-
tity pairs. In this paper, we propose
a joint inference framework that utilizes
these global clues to resolve disagree-
ments among local predictions. We ex-
ploit two kinds of clues to generate con-
straints which can capture the implicit type
and cardinality requirements of a relation.
Experimental results on three datasets, in
both English and Chinese, show that our
framework outperforms the state-of-the-
art relation extraction models when such
clues are applicable to the datasets. And,
we find that the clues learnt automatically
from existing knowledge bases perform
comparably to those refined by human.
1 Introduction
Identifying predefined kinds of relationship be-
tween pairs of entities is crucial for many knowl-
edge base related applications(Suchanek et al,
2013). In the literature, relation extraction (RE) is
usually investigated in a classification style, where
relations are simply treated as isolated class labels,
while their definitions or background information
are sometimes ignored. Take the relation Capital
as an example, we can imagine that this relation
will expect a country as its subject and a city as
object, and in most cases, a city can be the capital
of only one country. All these clues are no doubt
helpful, for instance, Yao et al (2010) explicitly
modeled the expected types of a relation?s argu-
ments with the help of Freebase?s type taxonomy
and obtained promising results for RE.

Yansong Feng is the corresponding author.
However, properly capturing and utilizing such
typing clues are not trivial. One of the hurdles here
is the lack of off-the-shelf resources and such clues
often have to be coded by human experts. Many
knowledge bases do not have a well-defined typing
system, let alne fine-grained typing taxonomies
with corresponding type recognizers, which are
crucial to explicitly model the typing requirements
for arguments of a relation, but rather expensive
and time-consuming to collect. Similarly, the car-
dinality requirements of arguments, e.g., a person
can have only one birthdate and a city can only be
labeled as capital of one country, should be con-
sidered as a strong indicator to eliminate wrong
predictions, but has to be coded manually as well.
On the other hand, most previous relation ex-
tractors process each entity pair (we will use en-
tity pair and entity tuple exchangeably in the rest
of the paper) locally and individually, i.e., the ex-
tractor makes decisions solely based on the sen-
tences containing the current entity pair and ig-
nores other related pairs, therefore has difficulties
to capture possible disagreements among different
entity pairs. However, when looking at the output
of a multi-class relation predictor globally, we can
easily find possible incorrect predictions such as a
university locates in two different cities, two dif-
ferent cities have been labeled as capital for one
country, a country locates in a city and so on.
In this paper, we will address how to derive and
exploit two categories of these clues: the expected
types and the cardinality requirements of a rela-
tion?s arguments, in the scenario of relation extrac-
tion. We propose to perform joint inference upon
multiple local predictions by leveraging implicit
clues that are encoded with relation specific re-
quirements and can be learnt from existing knowl-
edge bases. Specifically, the joint inference frame-
work operates on the output of a sentence level re-
lation extractor as input, derives 5 types of con-
straints from an existing KB to implicitly capture
818
the expected type and cardinality requirements for
a relation?s arguments, and jointly resolve the dis-
agreements among candidate predictions. We for-
malize this procedure as a constrained optimiza-
tion problem, which can be solved by many opti-
mization frameworks. We use integer linear pro-
gramming (ILP) as the solver and evaluate our
framework on English and Chinese datasets. The
experimental results show that our framework per-
forms better than the state-of-the-art approaches
when such clues are applicable to the datasets. We
also show that the automatically learnt clues per-
form comparably to those refined manually.
In the rest of the paper, we first review related
work in Section 2, and in Section 3, we describe
our framework in detail. Experimental setup and
results are discussed in Section 4. We conclude
this paper in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Since traditional supervised relation extraction
methods (Soderland et al, 1995; Zhao and Gr-
ishman, 2005) require manual annotations and are
often domain-specific, nowadays many efforts fo-
cus on semi-supervised or unsupervised methods
(Banko et al, 2007; Fader et al, 2011). Distant
supervision (DS) is a semi-supervised RE frame-
work and has attracted many attentions (Bunescu,
2007; Mintz et al, 2009; Yao et al, 2010; Sur-
deanu et al, 2010; Hoffmann et al, 2011; Sur-
deanu et al, 2012). DS approaches can predict
canonicalized (predefined in KBs) relations for
large amount of data and do not need much hu-
man involvement. Since the automatically gener-
ated training datasets in DS often contain noises,
there are also research efforts focusing on reduc-
ing the noisy labels in the training data (Takamatsu
et al, 2012). To bridge the gaps between the rela-
tions extracted from open information extraction
and the canonicalized relations in KBs, Yao et al
(2012) and Riedel et al (2013) propose a universal
schema which is a union of KB schemas and nat-
ural language patterns, making it possible to in-
tegrate the unlimited set of uncanonicalized rela-
tions in open settings with the relations in existing
KBs.
As far as we know, few works have managed
to take the relation specific requirements for ar-
guments into account, and most existing works
make predictions locally and individually. The
MultiR system allows entity tuples to have more
than one relations, but still predicts each entity
tuple locally (Hoffmann et al, 2011). Surdeanu
et al (2012) propose a two-layer multi-instance
multi-label (MIML) framework to capture the de-
pendencies among relations. The first layer is a
multi-class classifier making local predictions for
single sentences, the output of which are aggre-
gated by the second layer into the entity pair level.
Their approach only captures relation dependen-
cies, while we learn implicit relation backgrounds
from knowledge bases, including argument type
and cardinality requirements. Riedel et al (2013)
propose to use latent vectors to estimate the pref-
erences between relations and entities. These can
be considered as the latent type information of the
relations? arguments, which is learnt from various
data sources. In contrast, our approach learn im-
plicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly opti-
mize local predictions among different entity tu-
ples to capture both relation argument type clues
and cardinality clues. Li et al (2011) and Li et al
(2013) use co-occurring statistics among relations
or events to jointly improve information extrac-
tion performances in ACE tasks, while we mine
existing KBs to collect global clues to solve lo-
cal conflicts and find the optimal aggregation as-
signments, regarding existing knowledge facts. de
Lacalle and Lapata (2013) encode general domain
knowledge as FOL rules in a topic model while
our instantiated constraints are directly operated in
an ILP model. Zhang et al (2013) utilize relation
cardinality to create negative samples for distant
supervision while we use both implicit type clues
and relation cardinality expectations to discover
possible inconsistencies among local predictions.
3 The Framework
Our framework takes a set of entity pairs and their
supporting sentences as its input. We first train
a preliminary sentence level extractor which can
output confidence scores for its predictions, e.g.,
a maximum entropy or logistic regression model,
and use this local extractor to produce local predic-
tions. In order to implicitly capture the expected
type and cardinality requirements for a relation?s
arguments, we derive two kinds of clues from an
existing KB, which are further utilized to discover
the disagreements among local candidate predic-
tions. Our objective is to maximize the overall
confidence of all the selected predictions.
819
3.1 Generating Candidate Relations
Since we will focus on the open domain relation
extraction, we still follow the distant supervision
paradigm to collect our training data guided by
a KB, and train the local extractor accordingly.
Specifically, we train a sentence level extractor us-
ing the maximum entropy model. Given a sen-
tence containing an entity pair, the model will
output the confidence of this sentence represent-
ing certain relationship (from a predefined relation
set) between the entity pair. Formally R repre-
sents the relation set we are working on, T is the
set of entity tuples that we will predict in the test
set.
Keep in mind that our local extractor is trained
on noisy training data, which, we admit, is not
fully reliable. As we observed in a pilot experi-
ment that there is a good chance that the predic-
tions ranked in the second or third may still be
correct, we select top three predictions as the can-
didate relations for each mention in order to intro-
duce more potentially correct output.
On the other hand, we should discard the pre-
dictions whose confidences are too low to be true,
where we set up a threshold of 0.1. For a tuple t,
we obtain its candidate relation set by combining
the candidate relations of all its mentions, and rep-
resent it as R
t
. For a candidate relation r ? R
t
and
a tuple t, we define M
r
t
as all t?s mentions whose
candidate relations contain r. Now the confidence
score of a relation r ? R
t
being assigned to tuple
t can be calculated as:
conf(t, r) =
?
m?M
r
t
MEscore(m, r) (1)
where MEscore(m, r) is the confidence of mention
m representing relation r output by our prelimi-
nary extractor.
Traditionally, both lexical features and syntac-
tic features are used in relation extraction. Lexi-
cal features are the word chains between the sub-
jects and objects in the sentences, while syntactic
features are the dependency paths from the sub-
jects to the objects on the dependency graphs of
the supporting sentences. However, lexical fea-
tures are usually too specific to frequently appear
in the test data, while the reliability of syntactic
features depends heavily on the quality of depen-
dency parsing tools. Generally, we expect more
potentially correct relations to be put into the can-
didate relation set for further consideration. So in

will investigate in the candidate relations. The
clues of detecting these inconsistencies can be
learnt from a knowledge base.
addition to lexical and syntactic features, we also
use n-gram features to train our preliminary rela-
tion extraction model. N-gram features are consid-
ered as more ambiguous compared to traditional
lexical and syntactic features, and may introduce
incorrect predictions, thus improving the recall at
the cost of precision.
3.2 Disagreements among the Candidates
The candidate relations we obtained in the pre-
vious subsection inevitably include many incor-
rect predictions. Ideally we should discard those
wrong predictions to produce more accurate re-
sults.
As discussed earlier, we will exploit from the
knowledge base two categories of clues that im-
plicitly capture relations? backgrounds: their ex-
pected argument types and argument cardinalities,
based on which we can discover two categories
of disagreements among the candidate predictions,
summarized as argument type inconsistencies and
violations of arguments? uniqueness, which have
been rarely considered before. We will discuss
them in detail, and describe how to learn the clues
from a KB afterwards.
Implicit Argument Types Inconsistencies:
Generally, the argument types of the correct
predictions should be consistent with each other.
Given a relation, its arguments sometimes are
required to be certain types of entities. For
example, in Figure 1, the relation LargestCity
restricts its subject to be either countries or states,
and its object to be cities. If the predictions
among different entity tuples require the same
entity to belong to different types, we call this
820
an argument type inconsistency. Take <USA,
New York> and <USA, Washington D.C.> as an
example. In Figure 1, <USA, New York> has
a candidate relation LargestCity which restricts
USA to be either countries or states, while <USA,
Washington D.C.> has a prediction LocationCity
which indicates a disagreement in terms of USA?s
type because the latter prediction expects USA to
be an organization located in a city. This warns
that at least one of the two candidate relations is
incorrect.
The previous scenario shows that the subjects
of two candidate relations may disagree with each
other. From Figure 1, we can observe two more
situations: the first one is that the objects of
the two candidate relations are inconsistent with
each other, for example <New York University,
New York> with the prediction LocationCity and
<Columbia University, New York> with the pre-
diction LocationCountry. The second one is
that the subject of one candidate relation do not
agree with another prediction?s object, for exam-
ple <Richard Fuld, USA> with the prediction Na-
tionality and <USA, New York> with the pre-
diction LocationCity. Although we have not as-
signed explicit types to these entities, we can still
exploit the inconsistencies implicitly with the help
of shared entities. Note that the implicit argument
typing clues here mean whether two relations can
share arguments, but NOT enumate what types ex-
plicitly their arguments should have.
We formalize all the relation pairs that disagree
with each other as follows. These relation pairs
can be divided into three subcategories. We repre-
sent the relation pairs (r
i
, r
j
) that are inconsistent
in terms of subjects as C
sr
, the relations pairs that
are inconsistent in terms of objects as C
ro
, the re-
lation pairs that are inconsistent in terms of one?s
subject and the other one?s object as C
rer
.
It is worth mentioning that disagreements in-
side a tuple are also included here. For instance,
an entity tuple <USA, Washington D.C.> in Fig-
ure 1 has two candidate relations, Capital and Lo-
cationCity. These two predictions are inconsistent
with each other with respect to the type of USA.
They implicitly consider USA as ?country? and
?organization?, respectively.
Violations of Arguments? Uniqueness: The
previous categories of disagreements are all based
on the implicit type information of the relations?
arguments, Now we make use of the clues of ar-
gument cardinality requirements. Given a subject,
some relations should have unique objects. For
example, in Figure 1, given USA as the subject of
the relation Capital, we can only accept one pos-
sible object, because there is great chance that a
country only have one capital. On the other hand,
given Washington D.C. as the object of the relation
Capital, we can only accept one subject, since usu-
ally a city can only be the capital of one country
or state. If these are violating in the candidates,
we could know that there may be some incorrect
predictions. We represent the relations expecting
unique objects as C
ou
, and the relations expecting
unique subjects as C
su
.
3.3 Obtaining the Global Clues
Now, the issue is how to obtain the clues used
in the previous subsection. That is, how we de-
termine which relations expect certain types of
subjects, which relations expect certain types of
objects, etc. These knowledge can be definitely
coded by human, or learnt from a KB.
Most existing knowledge bases represent their
knowledge facts in the form of (<subject, rela-
tion, object>) triple, which can be seen as re-
lational facts between entity tuples. Usually the
triples in a KB are carefully defined by experts. It
is rare to find inconsistencies among the triples in
the knowledge base. The clues are therefore learnt
from KBs, and further refined manually if needed.
Given two relations r
1
and r
2
, we query the KB
for all tuples bearing the relation r
1
or r
2
. We use
S
i
and O
i
to represent r
i
?s (i ? {1, 2}) subject set
and object set, respectively. We adopt the point-
wise mutual information (PMI) to estimate the de-
pendency between the argument sets of two rela-
tions:
PMI(A,B) = log
p(A,B)
p(A)p(B)
(2)
where p(A,B) is number of the entities both in
A and B, p(A) and p(B) are the numbers of
the entities in A and B, respectively. For any
pair of relations from R ? R, we calculate four
scores: PMI(S
1
, S
2
), PMI(O
1
, O
2
), PMI(S
1
, O
2
)
and PMI(S
2
, O
1
). To make more stable esti-
mations, we set up a threshold for the PMI. If
PMI(S
1
, S
2
) is lower than the threshold, we will
consider that r
1
and r
2
cannot share a subject.
Things are similar for the other three scores. The
threshold is set to -3 in this paper.
821
We can also learn the uniqueness of arguments
for relations. For each pre-defined relation in R,
we collect all the triples containing this relation,
and count the portion of the triples which only
have one object for each subject, and the por-
tion of the triples which only have one subject
for each object. The relations whose portions are
higher than the threshold will be considered to
have unique argument values. This threshold is
set to 0.8 in this paper.
3.4 Integer Linear Program Formulation
As discussed above, given a set of entity pairs and
their candidate relations output by a preliminary
extractor, our goal is to find an optimal configura-
tion for all those entities pairs jointly, solving the
disagreements among those candidate predictions
and maximizing the overall confidence of the se-
lected predictions. This is an NP-hard optimiza-
tion problem. Many optimization models can be
used to obtain the approximate solutions.
In this paper, we propose to solve the problem
by using an ILP tool, IBM ILOG Cplex
1
. Firstly,
for each tuple t and one of its candidate relations
r, we define a binary decision variable d
r
t
indicat-
ing whether the candidate relation r is selected by
the solver. Our objective is to maximize the total
confidence of all the selected candidates, and the
objective function can be written as:
max
?
t?T ,r?R
t
conf(t, r)d
r
t
+
?
?t,r?R
t
,m?M
r
t
maxMEscore(m, r)d
r
t
where conf(t, r) is the confidence of the tuple t
bearing the candidate relation r. The first compo-
nent is the sum of the original confidence scores of
all the selected candidates, and the second one is
the sum of the maximal mention-level confidence
scores of all the selected candidates. The latter is
designed to encourage the model to select the can-
didates with higher individual mention-level con-
fidence scores.
We add the constraints with respect to the dis-
agreements described in Section 3.2. For the sake
of clarity, we describe the constraints derived from
each scenario of the two categories of disagree-
ments separately.
The subject-relation constraints avoid the dis-
agreements between the predictions of two tuples

sharing a subject. These constraints can be repre-
sented as:
d
r
t
i
t
i
+ d
r
t

t
j
? 1 (3)
?t

: subj(t
i
) = subj(t
j
) ? (r
t
i
, r
t
j
) ? C
sr
where t
i
and t
j
are two tuples in T , subj(t
i
) is the
subject of t
i
, r
t
i
is a candidate relation of t
i
, r
t
j
is
a candidate relation of t
j
.
The object-relation constraints avoid the incon-
sistencies between the predictions of two tuples
sharing an object. Formally we add the following
constraints:
d
r
t
i
t
i
+ d
r
t
j
t
j
? 1 (4)
?t

: obj(t

) = obj(t
j
) ? (r
t
i
, r
t

) ? C
ro
where t
i
? T and t
j
? T are two tuples, obj(t
i
)
is the object of t
i
.
The relation-entity-relation constraints ensure
that if an entity works as subject and object in two
tuples t
i
and t
j
respectively, their relations agree
with each other. The constraints we add are:
d
r
t
i
t
i
+ d
r
t

t

: obj(t
i
) = subj(t
j
) ? (r
t
i
, r
t
j
) ? C
rer
The object uniqueness constraints ensure that
the relations requiring unique objects do not bear
more than one object given a subject.
?
t?Tuple(r),subj(t)=e
d
r
t
? 1 (6)
?e ? r ? C
ou
where e is an entity, Tuple(r) are the tuples whose
candidate relations contain r.
The subject uniqueness constraints ensure that
given an object, the relations expecting unique
subjects do not bear more than one subject.
?
t?Tuple(r),obj(t)=e
d
r
t
? 1 (7)
?e ? r ? C
su
By adopting ILP, we can combine the local
information including MaxEnt confidence scores
and the implicit relation backgrounds that are em-
bedded into global consistencies of the entity tu-
ples together. After the optimization problem is
solved, we will obtain a list of selected candidate
relations for each tuple, which will be our final
output.

4 Experiments
4.1 Datasets
We evaluate our approach on three datasets, in-
cluding two English datasets and one Chinese
dataset.
The first English dataset, Riedel?s dataset, is the
one used in (Riedel et al, 2010; Hoffmann et al,
2011; Surdeanu et al, 2012), with the same split.
It uses Freebase as the knowledge base and New
York Time corpus as the text corpus, including
about 60,000 entity tuples in the training set, and
about 90,000 entity tuples in the testing set.
We generate the second English dataset, DB-
pedia dataset, by mapping the triples in DBpedia
(Bizer et al, 2009) to the sentences in New York
Time corpus. We map 51 different relations to the
corpus and result in about 50,000 entity tuples,
134,000 sentences for training and 30,000 entity
tuples, 53,000 sentences for testing.
For the Chinese dataset, we derive knowledge
facts and construct a Chinese KB from the In-
foboxes of HudongBaike, one of the largest Chi-
nese online encyclopedias. We collect four na-
tional economic newspapers in 2009 as our corpus.
28 different relations are mapped to the corpus and
this results in 60,000 entity tuples, 120,000 sen-
tences for training and 40,000 tuples, 83,000 sen-
tences for testing.
4.2 Baselines and Competitors
The baseline we use in this paper is Mintz++,
which is described in (Surdeanu et al, 2012). It
is a modification of the model proposed by Mintz
et al (2009). The model predicts for each mention
separately, and allows multi-label outputs for an
entity tuple by OR-ing the outputs of its mentions.
As we described in Section 3.1, originally we
select the top three predicted relations as the can-
didates for each mention. In order to investigate
whether it is necessary to use up to three candi-
dates, we implement two variants of our approach,
which select the top one and top two relations as
candidates for each mention, and represented as
ILP-1cand and ILP-2cand, respectively.
We also use two distant supervision approaches
for the comparison. The first one is MultiR (Hoff-
mann et al, 2011), a novel joint model that can
deal with the relation overlap issue. The second
one, MIML-RE (Surdeanu et al, 2012), is one of
the state-of-the-art MIML relation extraction sys-
tems. We tune the models of MultiR and MIML-
RE so that they fit our datasets.
4.3 Overall Performance
First we compare our framework and its vari-
ants with the baseline and the state-of-the-art RE
models. Following previous works, we use the
Precision-Recall curve as the evaluation criterion
in our experiment. The results are summarized
in Figure 2. For the constraints, we first manu-
ally select an average of 20 relation pairs for each
subcategory of the first kind of clues, and all the
relations with unique argument values in R. We
also show how automatically learnt clues perform
in Section 4.5.
Figure 2 shows that compared with the baseline,
our framework performs consistently better in the
DBpedia dataset and the Chinese dataset. Mintz++
proves to be a strong baseline on both datasets. It
tends to result in a high recall, and its weakness of
low precision is perfectly fixed by the ILP model.
Our ILP model and its variants all outperform
Mintz++ in precision in both datasets, indicating
that our approach helps filter out incorrect predic-
tions from the output of MaxEnt model. Com-
pared with MultiR, our framework obtains better
results in both datasets. Especially in the Chinese
dataset, the improvement in precision reaches as
high as 10-16% at the same recall points. Our
framework performs better compared to MIML-
RE in the English dataset. On the Chinese dataset,
our framework outperforms MIML-RE except in
the low-recall portion (<10%) of the P-R curve.
All these results show that embedding the relation
background information into RE can help elim-
inate the wrong predictions and improve the re-
sults.
However, in the Riedel?s dataset, Mintz++, the
MaxEnt relation extractor, does not perform well,
and our framework cannot improve its perfor-
mance. In order to find out the reasons, we manu-
ally investigate the dataset. The top three relations
of this dataset are /location/location/contains,
/people/person/nationality and
/people/person/place lived. About two-thirds of
the entity tuples belongs to these three relations,
and the outputs of the local extractor usually
bias even more to the large relations. What is
worse, we cannot find any clues from the top
three relations because their arguments? types are
too general. Things are similar for many other

relations in this dataset. Although we may find
some clues any way, they are too few to make
any improvement. Hence, our framework does
not perform well due to the poor performance of
MaxEnt extractor and the lack of clues. To solve
this problem, we think of addressing the selection
preferences between relations and entities pro-
posed in (Riedel et al, 2013), which should be
our future work.
We notice that in all three datasets our variant
ILP-1cand is shorter than Mintz++ in recall, in-
dicating we may incorrectly discard some predic-
tions. Compared to ILP-2cand and original ILP,
ILP-1cand leads to slightly lower precision but
much lower recall, showing that selecting more
candidates may help us collect more potentially
correct predictions. Comparing ILP-2cand and
original ILP, the latter hardly makes any improve-
ment in precision, but is slightly longer in re-
call, indicating using three candidates can still col-
lect some more potentially correct predictions, al-
though the number may be limited.
In order to study how our framework improves
the performances on the DBpedia dataset and the
Chinese dataset, we further investigate the num-
ber of incorrect predictions eliminated by ILP and
the number of incorrect predictions corrected by
ILP. We also examine the number of correct pre-

dictions newly introduce by ILP, which were NA
in Mintz++. We summarize the results in Table 1.
The results show that our framework can reduce
the incorrect predictions and introduce more cor-
rect predictions at the same time. We also find
an interesting results: in the DBpedia dataset, ILP
is more likely to introduce correct predictions to
the results, while in the Chinese dataset it tends to
reduce more incorrect predictions, which may be
caused by the differences between performances
of Mintz++ on the two datasets, where it gets a
higher recall on the Chinese dataset.
Following Surdeanu et al (2012), we also list
the peak F1 score (highest F1 score) for each
model in Table 2. Different from (Surdeanu et al,
2012), we use all the entity pairs instead of the
ones with more than 10 mentions. We can observe
that our model obtains the best performance in the
DBpedia dataset and the Chinese dataset. In the
DBpedia dataset, it is 3.6% higher than Mintz++,
824
7.9% higher than MIML-RE and 13.9% higher
than MultiR. In the Chinese dataset, Mintz++,
MultiR and MIML-RE performs similarly in terms
of the highest F1 score, while our model gains
about 8% improvement. In the Riedel?s dataset,
our framework hardly obtains any improvement
compared with Mintz++.
We also investigate the impacts of the con-
straints used in ILP, which are derived based on the
two kinds of clues and can encode relation defini-
tion information into our framework. Experimen-
tal results in Table 2 shows that in the DBpedia
dataset, the highest F1 score increases from 35.2%
to 38.3% with the help of both kinds of clues,
while in the Chinese dataset the improvement is
from 44.4% to 52.8%. In the Riedel?s dataset we
do not see any improvements since there are al-
most no clues. Furthermore, using constraints de-
rived from only one kind of clues can also improve
the performance, but not as well as using both of
them.
4.4 Adapting MultiR Sentence Level
Extractor to Our Framework
The preliminary relation extractor of our optimiza-
tion framework is not limited to the MaxEnt ex-
tractor, and can take any sentence level relation
extractor with confidence scores. We also fit Mul-
tiR?s mention level extractor into our framework.
As shown in Figure 3, in the DBpedia dataset
and the Chinese dataset, in most parts of the curve,
ILP optimized MultiR outperforms original Mul-
tiR. We think the reason is that our framework
make use of global clues to discard the incorrect
predictions. The results are not as high as when
we use MaxEnt as the preliminary extractor. We
think one reason is that MultiR does not perform
well in these two datasets. Furthermore, the confi-
dence scores which MultiR outputs are not nor-
malized to the same scale, which brings us dif-
ficulties in setting up a confidence threshold to
select the candidates. As a result, we only use
the top one result as the candidate since including
top two predictions without thresholding the confi-
dences performs bad, indicating that a probabilis-
tic sentence-level extractor is more suitable for our
framework. We also notice that in the Riedel?s
dataset our framework does not improve the per-
formance significantly, and we have discussed the
reasons in Section 4.3.

4.5 Examining the Automatically Learnt
Clues
Now we evaluate the performance of automati-
cally collected clues used in our model. Since
there are almost no clues in the Riedel?s dataset,
we only investigate the other two datasets. We add
clues according to their related relations? propor-
tions in the local predictions. For example, Coun-
try and birthPlace take up about 30% in the local
predictions, we thus add clues that are related to
these two relations, and then move on with new
clues related to other relations according to those
relations? proportions in the local predictions.
As is shown in Figure 4, in both datasets, the
clues related to more local predictions will solve
more inconsistencies, thus are more effective.
Adding the first two relations improves the model
significantly, and as more relations are added, the

performances keep increasing until approaching
the still state. It is worth mentioning that when
sufficient learnt clues are added into the model, the
results are comparable to those based on the clues
refined manually, as shown in Figure 5. This indi-
cates that the clues can be collected automatically,
and further used to examine whether predicted re-
lations are consistent with the existing ones in the
KB, which can be considered as a form of quality
control.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we make use of the global clues de-
rived from KB to help resolve the disagreements
among local relation predictions, thus reduce the
incorrect predictions and improve the performance
of relation extraction. Two kinds of clues, includ-
ing implicit argument type information and argu-
ment cardinality information of relations are in-
vestigated. Our framework outperforms the state-
of-the-art models if we can find such clues in the
KB. Furthermore, our framework is scalable for
other local sentence level extractors in addition to
the MaxEnt model. Finally, we show that the clues
can be learnt automatically from the KB, and lead
to comparable performance to manually refined
ones.
For future work, we will investigate other kinds
of clues and attempt a joint optimization frame-
work that could host entity disambiguation, rela-
tion extraction and entity linking together. We
will also adopt selection preference between en-
tities and relations since sometimes we may not
find useful clues.
