Abstract
This paper presents the design of a textentry device
that requires only four buttons Such a device is ap
plicable as the text interface of portable machines and
as an interface for disabled people The textentry
system is predictive the basis for this is an adaptive
language model Our evaluation showed that the sys
tem is at least as ecient for the entry of free text as
the textentry systems of currentgeneration mobile
phones The system requires fewer keystrokes than a
full keyboard After adaptation one user reached a
maximum speed of  wpm
 Introduction
Electronic machinery is becoming smaller recent de
velopments in palmtop and mobilephone technologies
oer dramatic examples of this process Since smaller
machines are more portable their users have freer ac
cess to information Here however the user interface
is a major issue
If a machine is being used as a medium for person
toperson communications a natural interface might
be speechbased For other tasks however like brows
ing through Internet pages or looking up databases
the most natural tool for control and data entry is
still the keyboard
Mobile machines oer little surface space so only
a few buttons are available for the entry of text The
most representative form is the use of 	
 keys for text
entry on mobile phones However even smaller ma
chines continue to appear such as watchsized com
puters It might not be possible to equip such ma
chines with more than four or ve buttons Ques
tions then arise Is it possible to enter text with a
small number of buttons What about four buttons
How ecient can we make this
Other potential applications for text entry with
four buttons include the control panels of oce ma
chines and household machines Although these ma
chines increasingly contain functions that allow ac
cess to the Internet sucient surface space for a full
keyboard is often not available Another potential
application is in textentry interfaces for elderly and
disabled people A report of Advanced Design of
Integrated Information Society 


 indicates that
keyboard operation is the highest hurdle to the use of
computers by the aged The situation is even worse
for people with handrelated disabilities A textentry
device with four large buttons might facilitate human
machine communications by such people
The idea of decreasing the number of keys on
the keyboard in itself is not new The oldest re
alization of this idea is the stenotype keyboards
With the recent popularity of mobile machines re
searchers have become increasingly interested in one
handed keyboardsMathias et al 	 Most of the
work to date in this eld has been related to mo
bile phones Text entry on currentgeneration devices
remains cumbersome so innovative companiesTegic

 so the technology looks promising in the con
text of mobile phones
Our study goes further in decreasing the number of
buttons than the abovecited studies In our study
we tried various textentry methods and found the
predictive method to be the best As far as we know
no other study that includes the application of a lan
guage model has yet been carried out in this context
neither has the eciency of this approach been ex
amined Additionally the major contribution is our
study of the potential power of a language model by
examining its actual eciency on a device with few
buttons
In the next section we rst show how text is en
tered via our TouchMeKey keypad
 An Example
Figure 		 shows the GUI for the TouchMeKey key
pad Nine buttons are visible with four on either side
of the central boxes plus a quit button on the right
hand side In this paper we only count those buttons
that are only used for the entry of characters that
is the four on the righthand side We also impose
the constraint that the buttons may only be pressed
one at a time because the inclusion of keychords in
creases the actual number of buttons by including the
combinations of keys
Six or seven letters of the alphabet are assigned to
each of the buttons The no 	 key has abcdef the
no  key has ghijkl the no  key has mnopqrs
and the no  key has tuvwxyz The small letters
Figure 	 Entering the word technology with the
TouchMeKey keypad
are assigned to the same keys as the corresponding
capital letters All other ASCII characters other than
the alphanumeric characters are assigned to the no
 key
Suppose that we have just entered the string hu
man language The text appears in the upper box
in the middle of the window the upper textbox in
Figure 		 We now wish to enter the word tech
nology Words are entered through a singletap
percharacter form of predictive entry a key is only
pressed once to enter a character For example the
no  button is pressed once to enter the t of tech
nology To enter the subsequent e the no 	 button
is pressed once
After the no 	 button has been pressed the Touch
MeKey window is as shown in Figure 	

 Here we
see two dierences from Figure 		 The rst is that
	 appears in the box in the middle of the window
This indicates the string that the user has just en
tered The second change is that some words have ap
peared in the lower box in the middle of the window
a listbox that we call the candidatebox These
words are the candidate words that correspond to the
users input 	
Each press of a button by the user makes the Touch
MeKey system automatically search the dictionary
for candidates The candidates include longer words
as well as if such words exist words of the same
length as the entered sequence of digits The can
didates are thus all words that begin with one letter
from tuvwxyz followed by one letter from abcdef
For example text was and vendors are candi
dates as is the twocharacter candidate we
The numerous candidates are sorted into an order
before they are placed in the candidate box and shown
to the user The order is according to word probabil
ity as determined on the basis of PPM prediction
by partial match which has been proposed in the
informationtheory domain A detailed description is
given in x but we summarize the methods essence
here as part of our explanation of Figure 	 The rele
vance of each candidate is measured by statistics from
two sources
Base dictionary the unigram statistics collected
from a huge corpus of newspaper data and
User corpus the ngram statistics obtained from a
small personal document supplied by the user
In this example the Base dictionary is constructed
from one year of issues of the Wall Street Journal
WSJ that contains  


 dierent words and the
User Corpus is a computer magazine that contains 	




 words The particular User corpus is the reason
for the appearance of the relatively uncommon word
vendors among the top ve candidates Figure 	
Our target technology appears as the second
ranked candidate In selecting this word the user
highlights it by using the down button on the left

Note that the most recently pressed button is framed by a
thick line
hand side of the windowFigure 	 and then presses
the enter button Figure 	 We see that the se
lected candidate now appears in the upper textbox


In describing our realization of the TouchMeKey
system outlined above the following four questions
are discussed in the remainder of this paper
Interface Is some method other than that described
above suitable for text entry with a fourbutton
device
Candidate Estimation How can the system esti
mate the relevance of each candidate
Key Assignment How should characters be as
signed to the individual buttons
Number Of Keys What is the minimum number of
keys required Is the entry of free text with only
two buttons reasonably ecient
 Interface
Various methods for the entry of text via a four
button device are conceivable The biggest choice is
whether or not to adopt a predictive method
 NonPredictive Entry Methods
Lets start by considering the case where we dont
adopt prediction This means that we need to enable
the exact entry of the individual characters via the
four buttons One method of this type involves as
signing an order to the characters on each key a key
is then pressed i times to obtain the ith character
we call this the multitap method This method is
commonly applied on mobile phones
However there are two problems with this method
Firstly the user often needs to press a key numerous
times to obtain a single target character Secondly
there is an ambiguity in the user action when two
characters assigned to the same button are to be en
tered one after another aa requires the entry of 		
that can also be b This situation requires the use
of an escape
A second possible method is to press a rst button
to select it and then enter the number i to select the
ith character which is assigned to the rst button
For example on many mobile phones o is obtained
by pressing the no  key and then the no  key
since o is the third letter on the no  key However
if the number of letters on each key is greater than
the number of keys entry of the higher i values is
implausibly dicult With the TouchMeKey system
for example a system for the easy entry of fth and
sixth characters etc is not possible
In short the free entry of text turns out to be too
dicult with a fourbutton device unless we adopt

As with any system where a predictive method is applied
the weak point of TouchMeKey is the processing of unknown
words which do not appear in the dictionary Therefore it
is important that the Base dictionary contains a rich vocabu
lary When however an unknown word occurs it may still be
entered character by character by using the methods described
inx or the system may be connected with a larger dictionary
via a network

prediction This is so even for the case of English the
written form of which has relatively few characters
and is even more so for languages with large numbers
of characters such as Chinese Japanese or Thai 
characters We are thus obliged to use prediction
 Predictive Text entry
Generally there are two ways to predict candidates
The rst is the singletap method The earliest
appearance of this idea was at the beginning of the

s in Japan in discussions of processing systems
for Japanese textCoLtd 	 more recent work
has been concerned with mobile phones James and
Reischel 

	TanakaIshii et al 



The second way is prediction by prefix Given a
user input the system searches for words with the
corresponding prefix
This method of collecting candidates to be oered
to the user has been particularly successful in the en
try of Chinese text The method has also been applied
to certain textentry systems in the manmachine in
terface domain too Masui 	
As the description of x indicates the combination
of the two methods is adopted in our TouchMeKey
system It thus needs to process many candidates
for a single user entry The mechanism of estimating
levels of relevance for the words is explained in the
next section
 Applying an Adaptive Language
Model in Candidate Estimation
As was summarized in x the PPM prediction by
partial match framework is used by TouchMeKey
to estimate the relevance of candidates Its charac
teristic is that the word distribution is adapted to the
style of the users corpus
PPM was originally proposed as an adaptive lan
guage model for use in improving the compression
rates of arithmetic coding The estimation of prob
abilities by PPM thus guarantees a lowering of the
entropy of the language model PPM has successfully
been adapted to the userinterface domain in certain
previous worksTanakaIshii et al 

	Ward et al




Broadly PPM interpolates the ngram counts in
the user corpus and the statistics in the base dictio
nary The following formula is used to estimate a

We decided to utilize this PPM framework because

machines are in a personal context and oce and
household machines are used in particular contexts
