Abstract
We investigate the use of language in food
writing, specifically on restaurant menus and
in customer reviews. Our approach is to build
predictive models of concrete external vari-
ables, such as restaurant menu prices. We
make use of a dataset of menus and customer
reviews for thousands of restaurants in several
U.S. cities. By focusing on prediction tasks
and doing our analysis at scale, our method-
ology allows quantitative, objective measure-
ments of the words and phrases used to de-
scribe food in restaurants. We also explore
interactions in language use between menu
prices and sentiment as expressed in user re-
views.
1 Introduction
What words might a menu writer use to justify the
high price of a steak? How does describing an item
as chargrilled vs. charbroiled affect its price? When
a customer writes an unfavorable review of a restau-
rant, how is her word choice affected by the restau-
rant?s prices? In this paper, we explore questions
like these that relate restaurant menus, prices, and
customer sentiment. Our goal is to understand how
language is used in the food domain, and we di-
rect our investigation using external variables such
as restaurant menu prices.
We build on a thread of NLP research that seeks
linguistic understanding by predicting real-world
quantities from text data. Recent examples include
prediction of stock volatility (Kogan et al 2009)
and movie revenues (Joshi et al 2010). There, pre-
diction tasks were used for quantitative evaluation
and objective model comparison, while analysis of
learned models gave insight about the social process
behind the data.
We echo this pattern here as we turn our atten-
tion to language use on restaurant menus and in user
restaurant reviews. We use data from a large cor-
pus of restaurant menus and reviews crawled from
the web and formulate several prediction tasks. In
addition to predicting menu prices, we also consider
predicting sentiment along with price.
The relationship between language and senti-
ment is an active area of investigation (Pang and
Lee, 2008). Much of this research has focused on
customer-written reviews of goods and services, and
perspectives have been gained on how sentiment is
expressed in this type of informal text. In addition
to sentiment, however, other variables are reflected
in a reviewer?s choice of words, such as the price of
the item under consideration. In this paper, we take
a step toward joint modeling of multiple variables
in review text, exploring connections between price
and sentiment in restaurant reviews.
Hence this paper contributes an exploratory data
1357
analysis of language used to describe food (by its
purveyors and by its consumers). While our primary
goal is to understand the language used in our cor-
pus, our findings bear relevance to economics and
hospitality research as well. This paper is a step on
the way to the eventual goal of using linguistic anal-
ysis to understand social phenomena like sales and
consumption.
2 Related Work
There are several areas of related work scattered
throughout linguistics, NLP, hospitality research,
and economics.
Freedman and Jurafsky (2011) studied the use of
language in food advertising, specifically the words
on potato chip bags. They argued that, due to
the ubiquity of food writing across cultures, eth-
nic groups, and social classes, studying the use of
language for describing food can provide perspec-
tive on how different socioeconomic groups self-
identify using language and how they are linguisti-
cally targeted. In particular, they showed that price
affects how ?authenticity? is realized in marketing
language, a point we return to in ?5. This is an ex-
ample of how price can affect how an underlying
variable is expressed in language. Among other ex-
plorations in this paper, we consider how price inter-
acts with expression of sentiment in user reviews of
restaurants.
As mentioned above, our work is related to re-
search in predicting real-world quantities using text
data (Koppel and Shtrimberg, 2006; Ghose et al
2007; Lerman et al 2008; Kogan et al 2009; Joshi
et al 2010; Eisenstein et al 2010; Eisenstein et
al., 2011; Yogatama et al 2011). Like much of
this prior work, we aim to learn how language is
used in a specific context while building models that
achieve competitive performance on a quantitative
prediction task.
Along these lines, there is recent interest in ex-
ploring the relationship between product sales and
user-generated text, particularly online product re-
views. For example, Ghose and Ipeirotis (2011)
studied the sales impact of particular properties of
review text, such as readability, the presence of
spelling errors, and the balance between subjective
and objective statements. Archak et al(2011) had a
similar goal but decomposed user reviews into parts
describing particular aspects of the product being
reviewed (Hu and Liu, 2004). Our paper differs
from price modeling based on product reviews in
several ways. We consider a large set of weakly-
related products instead of a homogeneous selection
of a few products, and the reviews in our dataset are
not product-centered but rather describe the overall
experience of visiting a restaurant. Consequently,
menu items are not always mentioned in reviews and
rarely appear with their exact names. This makes it
difficult to directly use review features in a pricing
model for individual menu items.
Menu planning and pricing has been studied for
many years by the culinary and hospitality research
community (Kasavana and Smith, 1982; Kelly et al
1994), often including recommendations for writing
menu item descriptions (Miller and Pavesic, 1996;
McVety et al 2008). Their guidelines frequently
include example menus from successful restaurants,
but typically do not use large corpora of menus or
automated analysis, as we do here. Other work
focused more specifically on particular aspects of
the language used on menus, such as the study by
Zwicky and Zwicky (1980), who made linguistic ob-
servations through manual analysis of a corpus of
200 menus.
Relatedly, Wansink et al(2001; 2005) showed
that the way that menu items are described af-
fects customers? perceptions and purchasing behav-
ior. When menu items are described evocatively,
customers choose them more often and report higher
satisfaction with quality and value, as compared to
when they are given the same items described with
conventional names. Wansink et aldid not use a
corpus, but rather conducted a small-scale experi-
ment in a working cafeteria with customers and col-
lected surveys to analyze consumer reaction. While
our goals are related, our experimental approach is
different, as we use automated analysis of thousands
of restaurant menus and rely on a set of one mil-
lion reviews as a surrogate for observing customer
behavior.
Finally, the connection between products and
prices is also a central issue in economics. How-
ever, the stunning heterogeneity in products makes
empirical work challenging. For example, there are
over 50,000 menu items in New York that include

the word chicken. What is the price of chicken? This
is an important practical and daunting matter when
measuring inflation (e.g., Consumer Price Index is
measured with a precisely-defined basket of goods).
Price dispersion across goods and the variation of
the goods is an important area of industrial organi-
zation economic theory. For example, economists
are interested in models of search, add-on pricing,
and obfuscation (Baye et al 2006; Ellison, 2005).
3 Data
We crawled Allmenus.com (www.allmenus.
com) to gather menus for restaurants in seven
U.S. cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washing-
ton, D.C. Each menu includes a list of item names
with optional text descriptions and prices. Most All-
menus restaurant pages contain a link to the cor-
responding page on Yelp (www.yelp.com) with
metadata and user reviews for the restaurant, which
we also collected.
The metadata consist of many fields for each
restaurant, which can be divided into three cate-
gories: location (city, neighborhood, transit stop),
services available (take-out, delivery, wifi, parking,
etc.), and ambience (good for groups, noise level,
attire, etc.). Also, the category of food and a price
range ($ to $$$$, indicating the price of a typical
meal at the restaurant) are indicated. The user re-
views include a star rating on a scale of 1 to 5.
The distribution of prices of individual menu
items is highly skewed, with a mean of $9.22 but
a median of $6.95. On average, a restaurant has
73 items on its menu with a median price of $8.69
and 119 Yelp reviews with a median rating of 3.55
