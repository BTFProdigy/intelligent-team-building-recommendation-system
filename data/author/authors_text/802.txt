Grammars that expect words from the lexicon may be at odds with the transparent projection of
syntactic and semantic scope relations of smaller units. We propose a morphosyntactic framework
based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar that provides flexible constituency, flexible category
consistency, and lexical projection of morphosyntactic properties and attachment to grammar in
order to establish a morphemic grammar-lexicon. These mechanisms provide enough expressive
power in the lexicon to formulate semantically transparent specifications without the necessity
to confine structure forming to words and phrases. For instance, bound morphemes as lexical
items can have phrasal scope or word scope, independent of their attachment characteristics but
consistent with their semantics. The controls can be attuned in the lexicon to language-particular
properties. The result is a transparent interface of inflectional morphology, syntax, and semantics.
We present a computational system and show the application of the framework to English and
Turkish.
1. Introduction
The study presented in this article is concerned with the integrated representation and
processing of inflectional morphology, syntax, and semantics in a unified grammar ar-
chitecture. An important issue in such integration is mismatches in morphological,
syntactic, and semantic bracketings. The problem was first noted in derivational mor-
phology. Williams (1981) provided examples from English; the semantic bracketings
in (1a?2a) are in conflict with the morphological bracketings in (1b?2b).

hydro electric
-ity b. hydro

(2) a.

If the problem were confined to derivational morphology, we could avoid it by
making derivational morphology part of the lexicon that does not interact with gram-
mar. But this is not the case. Mismatches in morphosyntactic and semantic bracketing

also abound. This article addresses such problems and their resolution in a computa-
tional system.1
Mu?ller (1999, page 401) exemplifies the scope problem in German prefixes. (3a) is
in conflict with the bracketing required for the semantics of the conjunct (3b).

up at the airport.?
b. Ihr Lust habt UND noch nichts anderes vorhabt
Similar problems can be observed in Turkish inflectional suffixes. In the coordi-
nation of tensed clauses, the tense attaches to the verb of the rightmost conjunct (4a)
but applies to all conjuncts (4b). Delayed affixation appears to apply to all nominal
inflections (4c?e).

1 Our use of the term morphosyntax needs some clarification. Some authors, (e.g., Jackendoff 1997),
take it to mean the syntax of words, in contrast to the syntax of phrases. By morphosyntax we mean
those aspects of morphology and syntax that collectively contribute to grammatical meaning
composition. This is more in line with the inflectional-morphology-is-syntax view. In this respect, we
will not address problems related to derivational morphology; its semantics is notoriously
noncompositional and does not interact with grammatical meaning. Moreover, without a semantically
powerful lexicon such as Pustejovsky?s (1991), even the most productive fragment of derivational
morphology is hard to deal with (Sehitoglu and Bozsahin 1999).

Phrasal scope of inflection can be seen in subordination and relativization as well.
In (5a), the entire nominalized clause marked with the accusative case is the object
of want. In (5b), the relative participle applies to the relative clause, which lacks an
object. The object?s case is governed by the subordinate verb, whose case requirements
might differ from that of the matrix verb (5c). As we show later in this section, the
coindexing mechanisms in word-based unification accounts of unbounded extraction
face a conflict between the local and the nonlocal behavior of the relativized noun,
mainly due to applying the relative participle -dig?-i to the verbal stem ver rather than
the entire relative clause. A lexical entry for -dig?-i would resolve the conflict and
capture the fact that it applies to nonsubjects uniformly.

The morphological/phrasal scope conflict of affixes is not particular to morpho-
logically rich languages. Semantic composition of affixes in morphologically simpler
languages poses problems with word (narrow) scope of inflections. For instance, fake
trucks needs the semantics (plu(fake truck)), which corresponds to the surface brack-
eting [ fake truck ]-s, because it denotes the nonempty nonsingleton sets of things that
are not trucks but fake trucks (Carpenter 1997). Four trucks, on the other hand, has the
semantics (four(plu truck)), which corresponds to four [ truck ]-s, because it denotes the
subset of nonempty nonsingleton sets of trucks with four members.
The status of inflectional morphology among theories of grammar is far from
settled, but, starting with Chomsky (1970), there seems to be an agreement that deriva-
tional morphology is internal to the lexicon. Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG)
(Bresnan 1995) and earlier Government and Binding (GB) proposals e.g. (Anderson
1982) consider inflectional morphology to be part of syntax, but it has been del-
egated to the lexicon in Head-Driven Phase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard
and Sag 1994, page 35) and in the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995, page 195).
The representational status of the morpheme is even less clear. Parallel develop-
ments in computational studies of HPSG propose lexical rules to model inflectional
morphology (Carpenter and Penn 1994). Computational models of LFG (Tomita 1988)
and GB (Johnson 1988; Fong 1991), on the other hand, have been noncommittal re-
garding inflectional morphology. Finally, morphosyntactic aspects have always
been a concern in Categorial Grammar (CG) (e.g., Bach 1983; Carpenter 1992; Dowty
1979; Heylen 1997; Hoeksema 1985; Karttunen 1989; Moortgat 1988b; Whitelock
1988), but the issues of constraining the morphosyntactic derivations and re-
solving the apparent mismatches have been relatively untouched in computational
studies.
We briefly look at Phrase Structure Grammars (PSGs), HPSG, and Multimodal
CGs (MCGs) to see how word-based alternatives for morphosyntax would deal with
148
Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 2
the issues raised so far. For convenience, we call a grammar that expects words from
the lexicon a lexemic grammar and a grammar that expects morphemes a morphemic
grammar. A lexemic PSG provides a lexical interface for inflected words (X0s) such
that a regular grammar subcomponent handles lexical insertion at X0.2 In (4d), the
right conjunct c?ocuk-lar-a is analyzed as N0 ? c?ocuk-PLU-DAT (or N0 ? N0? -DAT,
N0? ? N0?? -PLU, N0?? ? Stem, as a regular grammar). Assuming a syncategorematic
coordination schema, that is, X ? X and X, the N0 in the left and right conjuncts
of this example would not be of the same type. Revising the coordination schema
such that only the root features coordinate would not be a solution either. In (4e),
the relation of possession that is marked on the right conjunct must be carried over
to the left conjunct as well. What is required for these examples is that the syntac-
tic constituent X in the schema be analyzed as X-PLU(-POSS)-DAT, after N0 and N0
coordination.
What we need then is not a lexemic but a morphemic organization in which brack-
eting of free and bound morphemes is regulated in syntax. The lexicon, of course,
must now supply the ingredients of a morphosyntactic calculus. This leads to a the-
ory in which semantic composition parallels morphosyntactic combination by virtue
of bound morphemes? being able to pick their domains just like words (above X0,
if needed). A comparison of English and Turkish in this regard is noteworthy. The
English relative pronouns that/whom and the Turkish relative participle -dig?-i would
have exactly the same semantics when the latter is granted a representational status
in the lexicon (see Section 6).
Furthermore, rule-based PSGs project a rigid notion of surface constituency. Steed-
man (2000) argued, however, that syntactic processes such as identical element dele-
tion under coordination call for flexible constituency, such as SO (subject-object) in
the SVO & SO gapping pattern of English and SV (subject-verb) constituency in
the OSV & SV pattern of Turkish. Nontraditional constituents are also needed in
specifying semantically transparent constituency of words, affixes, clitics, and
phrases.
Constraint-based PSGs such as HPSG appeal to coindexation and feature passing
via unification, rather than movement, to deal with such processes. HPSG also makes
the commitment that inflectional morphology is internal to the lexicon, handled either
by lexical rules (Pollard and Sag 1994) or by lexical inheritance (Miller and Sag 1997).
We look at (5c) to highlight a problem with the stem-and-inflections view. As words en-
ter syntax fully inflected, the sign of the verb ver-dig?-i in the relative clause (5c) would
be as in (6a), in which the SUBCAT list of the verb stem is, as specified in the lexi-
cal entry for ver, unsaturated. The participle adds coindexation in MOD| ? ? ? |INDEX.
The HPSG analysis of this example would be as in Figure 1. Although passing the
agreement features of the head separately (Sehitoglu 1996) solves the case problem
alluded to in (5c), however, structure sharing of the NPdat with the SLASH, INDEX,
and CONTENT features of ver-dig?-i is needed for semantics (GIVEE), but this conflicts
with the head features of the topmost NPacc in the tree. The relative participle as a
lexical entry (e.g., (6b)) would resolve the problem with subcategorization because its
SUBCAT list is empty (like the relative pronoun that in English), hence there would be
no indirect dependence of the nonlocal SLASH feature and the local SUBCAT feature
via semantics (CONTENT). Such morphemic alternatives are not considered in HPSG,
however, and require a significant revision in the theory. Furthermore, HPSG?s lexical

as we show later, is not necessary.

MCGs (Hepple 1990a; Morrill 1994; Moortgat and Oehrle 1994) allow different
modes of combination in the grammar. In addition to binary modes such as wrapping
and commutative operations, unary modalities provide finer control over the cate-
gories. Heylen (1997, 1999) uses unary modalities as a way of regulating morphosyn-
tactic features such as case, number, and person for economy in lexical assignments.
For instance, Frau has the category ?case?fem?sg?3p?declN, which underspecifies it for
case and declension. Underspecification is dealt with in the grammar using inclusion
postulates (e.g., (7)). The interaction of different modalities is regulated by distribution
postulates.
(7) ?case?  X
?nom?  X
?case?  X
?acc?  X
Lexical assignments to inflected words carry unary modalities: boys has the type
?plN, in contrast to ?sgN for boy. Although such regulation of inflectional features
successfully mediates, for example, subject-verb agreement or NP-internal case agree-
ment (as in German), it is essentially word-based, because type assignments are to
inflected forms; morphemes do not carry types. This reliance on word types neces-
sitates a lexical rule?based approach to some morphosyntactic processes that create
indefinitely long words, such as ki-relativization in Turkish (see Section 6.5). But lexical
rules for such processes risk nontermination (Sehitoglu and Bozsahin 1999). Our main
point of departure from MCG accounts is the morphemic versus lexemic nature of the
lexicon: The morphosyntactic and attachment modalities originate from the lexicon;
they are not properties of the grammar (we elaborate more on this later). This paves
the way to the morphemic lexicon by licensing type assignments to units smaller than
words.
Besides problems with lexical rules, the automata-theoretic power of MCGs is
problematic: Unrestricted use of structural modalities and postulates leads to Tur-
ing completeness (Carpenter 1999). Indeed, one of the identifiable fragments of Mul-

timodal languages that is computationally tractable is Combinatory Categorial lan-
guages (Kruijff and Baldridge 2000), which we adopt as the basis for the framework
presented here. We propose a morphosyntactic Combinatory Categorial Grammar
(CCG) in which the grammar and the morphemic lexicon refer to morphosyntactic
types rather than syntactic types. We first introduce the syntactic CCG in Section 2.
Morphosyntactic CCG is described in Section 3. In Section 4, we look at the compu-
tational aspects of the framework. We then show its realization for some aspects of
English (Section 5) and Turkish (Section 6).

2. Syntactic Types
CG is a theory of grammar in which the form-meaning relation is conceived as a
transparent correspondence between the surface-syntactic and semantic combinatorics
(Jacobson 1996). A CCG sign can be represented as a triplet ? ? ?:?, where ? is the
prosodic element, ? is its syntactic type, and ? its semantic type. For instance, the
lexical assignment for read is (8).3
(8) read := read ? (S\NP)/NP:?x.?y.read xy
Definition (Syntactic Types)
? The set of basic syntactic categories: As = {N,NP,S,S?t,S+t}
? The set of complex syntactic categories: Bs
? As ? Bs
? If X ? Bs and Y ? Bs, then X\Y and X/Y ? Bs
The classical Ajdukiewicz/Bar-Hillel (AB) CG is weakly equivalent to Context-
Free Grammars (Bar-Hillel, Gaifman, and Shamir 1960). It has function application
rules, defined originally in a nondirectional fashion. The directional variants and their
associated semantics are as follows:
(9) Forward Application (>):4 X/Y: f Y: a ? X: fa
Backward Application (<): Y: a X\Y: f ? X: fa
CCG (Steedman 1985, 1987, 1988; Szabolcsi 1983, 1987) is an extended version of
AB that includes function composition (10), substitution, and type raising (11). These
extensions make CCGs mildly context sensitive.
(10) Forward Composition (>B): X/Y: f Y/Z: g ? X/Z:?x.f (gx)
Backward Composition (<B): Y\Z: g X\Y: f ? X\Z:?x.f (gx)
(11) Forward Type Raising (>T):5 X: a ? T/(T\X):?f .f [a]
Backward Type Raising (<T): X: a ? T\(T/X):?f .f [a]
Type raising is an order-preserving operation. For instance, Lambek?s (1958) cat-
egory S/(S\NP) is a positional encoding of the grammatical subject as a function
3 We take ? to be the surface string for simplicity. We use the ?result-first? convention for CG. For
instance, transitive verbs of English are written as (S\NP)/NP, which translates to (NP\S)/NP in the
?result-on-top? convention.
4 We omit the prosodic element for ease of exposition. For instance, the complete definition of forward
application is s1 ? X/Y: f s2 ? Y: a ? s1 ? s2 ? X: fa, where ? is prosodic combination and fa is the
application of f to a. The ? will play a crucial role in the lexicalization of attachment later on.
5 The lambda term f [a] denotes internal one-step ?-reduction of f on a. In parsing, we achieve the same
effect by partial execution (Pereira and Shieber 1987). ?f .f [a] is encoded as (a^F)^F in Prolog, where ?
is lambda abstraction. We opted for the explicit f [a] notation mainly for ease of exposition (cf. the
semantics of raising verbs, relative participles, etc. in Section 6). Moreover, as Pereira and Shieber
noted, (a^F)^F is not a lambda term in the strict sense because a is not a variable.
152

looking for a VP (= S\NP) to the right to become S. The reversal of directionality such
as topicalization (e.g., This book, I recommend) requires another schema. The reversal
is with respect to the position of the verb, which we shall call contraposition and
formulate as in (12).6 (<XP) is leftward extraction of a right constituent, and (>XP)
is rightward extraction of a left constituent, both of which are marked constructions.
Directionally insensitive types such as T|(T|X) cause the collapse of directionality in
surface grammar (Moortgat 1988a).
(12) Leftward Contraposition (<XP): X: a ? S+t/(S/X):?f .f [a]
S+t/(S+t/X):?f .f [a]
Rightward Contraposition (>XP): X: a ? S?t\(S\X):?f .f [a]
S?t\(S?t\X):?f .f [a]
The semantics of contraposition depends on discourse properties as well. We leave
this issue aside by (1) noting that it is related to type raising in changing the function-
argument relation and (2) categorizing the sentence as S+t (topicalized) or S?t (detopi-
calized), which are not discourse equivalent to S. Syntactic characterization as such
also helps a discourse component do its work on syntactic derivations.
CCG?s notion of interpretation is represented in the Predicate-Argument Structure
(PAS). Its organization is crucial for our purposes, since the bracketing in the PAS is
the arbitrator for reconciling the bracketings in morphology and syntax via proper
lexical type assignments. It is the sole level of representation in CCG (Steedman 1996,
page 89).7 It is the level at which the conditions on objects of interpretation, such as
binding and control, are formulated. For instance, Steedman (1996) defines c-command
and binding conditions A, B, and C over the PAS. The PAS also reflects the obliqueness
order of the arguments:
Predicate . . . Tertiary-Term Secondary-Term Primary-Term
Assuming left associativity for juxtaposition, this representation yields the brack-
eting in (13) for the PAS. Having the primary argument as the outermost term is
motivated by the observations on binding asymmetries between subjects and comple-
ments in many languages (e.g., *Himself saw John, *heself).
(13)
3. Morphosyntactic Types
A syntactic type such as N does not discriminate morphosyntactically. A finer dis-
tinction can be made as singular nouns, plural nouns, case-marked nouns, etc. For
6 In fact, topicalization of nonperipheral arguments (This book, I would give to Mary) requires that (12) be
finitely schematized over valencies, such as S, S/NP, S/PP (Steedman 1985).
7 We will not elaborate on the theoretical consequences of having this level of representation; see, for
instance, Dowty (1991) and Steedman (1996).

instance, the set of number-marked nouns can be represented as
n
?N, where ? is a
morphosyntactic modality (?equals?) and n is a diacritic (for number). Books is of type
n
?N, but book is not. The type for books can be obtained morphosyntactically by as-
signing -s (-PLU) the functor type
n
?N\ b?N, where b stands for base. A syntactic type
such as N\N overgenerates.
Another modality, < (?up to and equals?), allows wider domains in morphosyn-
tactic typing. For instance,
n
< N represents the set of nouns marked on number or
any other diacritic that is lower than number in a partial order (e.g., Figure 2). The
inflectional paradigm of a language can be represented as a partial ordering us-
ing the modalities.8 For instance, if the paradigm is Base-Number-Case, we have
?(
b
< N) ? ?(
n
< N) ? ?(
c
< N), where ?(?) is the valuation function from the mor-
phosyntactic type ? to the set of strings that have the type ? . The ? modality is more
strict than < to provide finer control; although ?(
n
< N) ? ?(
c
< N), ?(
n
?N) ? ?( c?N),
because a noun can be number marked but not case marked or vice versa. Also,
?(
i
?N) ? ?(
i
< N) for any diacritic i since, for instance, the set of nouns marked up to
and including case includes case-marked, number-marked, and unmarked nouns.
The lattice consistency condition is imposed on the set of diacritics to ensure
category unity.9 In other words, the syntactic type X can be viewed as an abbreviation
for the morphosyntactic type

< X where  is the universal upper bound. It is the

9 In a lattice L, x ? y (morphosyntactically, x < y) is equivalent to the consistency properties x ? y = x
and x ? y = y. We use the join operator for this check, thus it suffices to have a join semilattice.

Different attachment characteristics of words, affixes, and clitics must be factored
into the prosodic domain as a counterpart of refining the morphosyntactic description.
In Montague Grammar, every syntactic rule is associated with a certain mode of at-
tachment, and this tradition is followed in MCG; attachment types are related with the
slash (e.g., /w for wrapping), which is a grammatical modality.
10 In the present frame-
work, however, attachment is projected from the lexicon to the grammar as a prosodic
property of the lexical items.11 The grammar is unimodal in the sense that / and \
simply indicate the function-argument distinction in adjacent prosodic elements. The
lexical projection of attachment further complements the notion of morphemic lexicon
so that bound morphemes are no longer parasitic on words but have an independent
10 See Dowty (1996) and Steedman (1996) for a discussion of bringing nonconcatenative combination into
grammar.
11 There is a precedent of associating attachment characteristics with the prosodic element rather than the
slash in CG (Hoeksema and Janda 1988). In Hoeksema and Janda?s notation, arguments can be
constrained on phonological properties and attachment. For instance, the English article a has its NP/N
category spelled out as </CX/N,NP,Pref>, indicating a consonantal first segment for the noun
argument and concatenation to the left.

i (affixation, syntactic concatenation, cliticization) of the prosodic element s.
Table 1 shows some lexical assignments for Turkish (e.g., the sign
a? s ? X\Y:?
characterizes a suffix). The morphosyntactic calculus of CCG is defined with the ad-
dition of morphosyntactic types and attachment modalities as follows (similarly, for
other combinatory rules):

The main functor?s argument specification (?1 of
?1
?1 Y in (15)) determines the
lattice condition in derivations.12 Hence the morphosyntactic decoration in lexical as-
signments propagates its lattice condition to grammar as in ?2?1?1 (cf. Heylen [1997],
in which the grammar rule imposes a fixed partial order, e.g., X/Y combines with Z if
12 This coincides with Steedman?s (1991b) observation that directionality of the main functor?s slash is
also a property of the same argument. The main functor is the one whose result type determines the
overall result type (i.e., X/Y in (15)).
156

Z ? Y). This is another prerequisite that must be fulfilled for the morphemic lexicon
to project the lexical specification of scope.
The grammar is not fixed on the attachment modality either (unlike a lexemic
grammar, which is fixed on combination of words). Hence another requirement is the
propagation of attachment to grammar. This is facilitated by the lexical types
m? s??:?,
where m is an attachment type. The attachment calculus
i?
j
? a
k? in (15), which reads
?attachment types i and j yield type k,? relates attachment to prosodic combination in
the grammar.13 It can be attuned to language-particular properties.
We can specify some prosodic properties of the attachment calculus for Turkish as
follows (x? indicates stress on the prosodic element x):
syntactic concatenation x?
s? y? = x?y?
affixation x?
a? y = xy?
cliticization x?
c? y = x?y?
4. Morpheme-Based Parsing
To contrast lexemic and morphemic processing, consider the Turkish example in (16a).
We show some stages of the derivation to highlight prosodic combination (?) as well.
Every item in the top row is a lexical entry. Allomorphs, such as that of tense, have the
same category in the lexicon (16b). Vowel harmony, voicing, and other phonological
restrictions are handled as constraints on the prosodic element. Constraint checking
can be switched off during parsing to obtain purely morphosyntactic derivations.

13 Clearly, much more needs to be done to incorporate intonation into the system. The motive for
attachment types is to provide the representational ingredients on behalf of the morphemic lexicon. As
one reviewer noted, CCG formulation of the syntax-phonology interface moved from autonomous
prosodic types (Steedman 1991a) to syntax-directed prosodic features (Steedman 2000b). The present
proposal for attachment modality is computationally compatible with both accounts: Combinatory
prosody can match prosodic types with morphosyntactic types. Prosodic features are associated with
the basic categories of a syntactic type in the latter formulation, hence they become part of the featural
inference that goes along with the matching of categories in the application of combinatory rules.
157
Bozsahin The Combinatory Morphemic Lexicon
The lexicalization of attachment modality helps to determine the prosodic domain
of postconditions. For instance, for Turkish, vowel harmony does not apply over word
boundaries, which can be enforced by applying it when the modality is
a? and c? , but
not
s? . Voicing applies to a? and s? , but not to c? .
The basic categories N, NP, S, S+t, and S?t carry agreement features of fixed arity
(e.g., tense and person for S, S+t, and S?t, and case, number, person, and gender for N
and NP). Positional encoding of such information as in Pulman (1996) allows efficient
term unification for the propagation of these features.14 Term unification also handles
the matching of complex categories in the CCG schema. For instance, ?1?1 A/(
?2
?2 B\ ?3?3 C)
combines with ?2?4 B\ ?3?5 C via (>) for B, C ? As, if ?2 ?2 ?2, ?3 ?3 ?3 (?i ? {< ,?}). Apart
from the matching of syntactic types and agreement, unification does no linguistic
work in this framework, in contrast to structure-sharing in HPSG and slash passing
in Unification CG (Calder, Klein, and Zeevat 1988).
CCG is worst-case polynomially parsable (Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993). This re-
sult depends on the finite schematization of type raising and bounded composition.
Assuming a maximum valence of four in the lexicon (Steedman 2000a), composition
(Bn) is bounded by n ? 3. The refinement of the type raising schema (11) for finite
schematization is shown in (17).
(17) a. Revised Forward Type Raising (>T): NP : a ? T/(T\NP ):?f .f [a]
b. Revised Backward Type Raising (<T): NP : a ? T\(T/NP ):?f .f [a]
T ? {S,S\NP, S\NP\NP, S\NP\NP\NP}.
The finite schematization of type raising suggests that it can be delegated to the
lexicon, for example, by a lexical rule that value-raises all functions onto NP to their
type-raised variety, such as NP/N to (S/(S\NP))/N. But this move presupposes the
presence of such functions in the lexicon, that is, a language with determiners. To be
transparent with respect to the lexicon, we make type raising and other unary schema
(contraposition) available in the grammar. Since both are finite schemas in the revised
formulation, the complexity result of Vijay-Shanker and Weir still holds. Checking the
lattice condition as in (15) incurs a constant factor with a finite lattice.
Type raising and composition cause the so-called spurious-ambiguity problem
(Wittenburg 1987): Multiple analyses of semantically equivalent derivations are pos-
sible in parsing. This is shown to be desirable from the perspective of prosody; for
example, different bracketings are needed to match intonational phrasing with syn-
tactic structure (Steedman 1991). From the parsing perspective, the redundancy of
analyses can be controlled by (1) grammar rewriting (Wittenburg 1987), (2) checking
the chart for PAS equivalence (Karttunen 1989; Komagata 1997), (3) making the proces-
sor parsimonious on using long-distance compositions (Pareschi and Steedman 1987),
or (4) parsing into normal forms (Eisner 1996; Hepple 1990b; Hepple and Morrill 1989;
Ko?nig 1989; Morrill 1999). We adopt Eisner?s method, which eliminates chains of com-
positions in O(1) time via tags in the grammar, before derivations are licensed. There
is a switch that can be turned off during parsing to obtain all surface bracketings.
14 Mediating agreement via unification, type subsumption, or set-valued indeterminacy has important
consequences on underspecification, the domain of agreement, and the notion of ?like categories? in
coordination (see Johnson and Bayer 1995; Dalrymple and Kaplan 2000; Wechsler and Zlatic? 2000).
Rather than providing an elaborate agreement system, we note that Pulman?s techniques provide the
mechanism for implementing agreement as atomic unification, subsumption hierarchies represented as
lattices, or set-valued features. The categorial ingredient of phrase-internal agreement can be provided
by endotypic functors when necessary (see Sections 5 and 6).
158
Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 2
There is also a switch for checking the PAS equivalence, with the warning that the
equivalence of two lambda expressions is undecidable.
The parser is an adaptation of the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm (Aho
and Ullman 1972, page 315), modified to handle unary rules as well: In the kth iteration
of the CKY algorithm to build constituents of length k, the unary rules apply to the CKY
table entries T[?i,?i+k ], i = 0, 1, . . . , n ? k; that is, k-length results of binary rules are
input to potential unary constituents of length k. In practice, this allows, for instance,
a nominalized clause to be type-raised after it is derived as a category of type N.
The remaining combinatory schema is already in Chomsky Normal Form, as required
by CKY. The finite schematization of CCG rules and constant costs incurred by the
normal form and lattice checking provide a straightforward extension of CKY-style
context-free parsing for CCG. Komagata (1997) claims that the average complexity of
CCG parsing is O(n3) even without the finite schematization of type raising (based on
the parsing of 22 sentences consisting of around 20 words, with a lexicon of 200 entries
and no derivation of semantics in the grammar; a morphological analyzer provided
five analyses per second to the parser). Statistical techniques developed for lexicalized
grammars (e.g., Collins 1997), readily apply to CCG to improve the average parsing
performance in large-scale practical applications (Hockenmaier, Bierner, and Baldridge
2000). Both Collins and Hockenmeier, Bierner, and Baldridge used section 02-21 of the
Wall Street Journal Corpus of Penn Treebank for training, which contains 40,886 words
(70,151 lexical entries). A recent initiative (Oflazer, et al 2001) aims to provide such a
resource of around one million words for Turkish. It encodes in the Treebank surface-
syntactic relations and the morphological breakdown of words. The latter is invaluable
for training morphemic grammars and lexicons.
In morpheme-based parsing, lattice conditions help eliminate the permutation
problem in endotypic categories. Such categories are typical of inflectional morphemes.
For instance, assume that three morphemes m1, m2, and m3 have endotypic categories
(say N\N), that they can appear only in this order, and that they are all optional. The
categorization of mi as
??i
< N\
?i
< N such that ??i ? ?i for all i, and ??j?1 ? ?j for j = 1, 2, 3
allows omissions (18a?b) but rules out the permutations (18c?d).15

The lattice and its consistency condition on derivability offer varying degrees of
flexibility. A lattice with only  and the relation ? would undo all the effects of
parameterization; it would be equivalent to a syntactic grammar in which every basic
category X stands for

< X. To enforce a completely lexemic syntax, a lattice with 
and free would define all functional categories as functions over free forms.
Morphological processing seems inevitable for languages like Turkish, and mor-
phological and lexical ambiguity such as that shown in (19) must be passed on to
syntax irrespective of how inflectional morphology is processed (isolated from or in-
tegrated with syntax). For the verbal paradigm, Jurafsky and Martin (2000) reports
Oflazer?s estimation that inflectional suffixes alone create around 40,000 word forms
per root. In the nominal paradigm, iterative processes such as ki-relativization (Sec-
tion 6.5) can create millions of word forms per nominal root (Hankamer 1989).

The questions that need to be answered related to processing are (1) What should a

stem from mismatches with semantics, were highlighted in the introduction. In other

words, a lexemic grammar (e.g., Figure 3a) is computationally nontransparent when
interpretation is a component of an NLP system.
Regarding the first question, let us consider two architectures from the perspective
of the lexicon for the purpose of morphology, morphemic syntax, and semantics inter-
face. The architecture in Figure 3b incorporates the current proposal as an interpretive
front end to a morphological analyzer such as Oflazer?s (1994), which delivers the anal-
yses of words as a stream of morphemes out of which the bound morphemes have to
be matched with their semantics from the affix lexicon to be interpretable in grammar.
The advantage of this model is its efficiency; morphological parsing of words is?in
principle?linear context free; hence, finite-state techniques and their computational
advantages readily apply. But the uninterpretable surface forms of bound morphemes
must match with those of the affix lexicon, and this is not necessarily a one-to-one
mapping because of multiple lexical assignments for capturing syntactic?semantic dis-
tinctions (e.g., dative case as a direct object, indirect object, or adjunct marker or -i
as a possessive and/or compound marker). Surface form?semantics pairing is not a
trivial task, particularly in the case of lexically composite affixes, which require se-
mantic composition as well as tokenization. The matching process needs to be aware
of all the syntactic contexts in which certain affix sequences act as a unit, for exam-
ple, relative participles and agreement markers (-dig?-i relative participle as -OP-POSS
or -OP-AGR), possessive and compound markers, etc., for Turkish. The factorization
of syntactic issues into a morphological analyzer would also make the separate mor-
phological component nonmodular or expand its number of states to factor in these
concerns (e.g., treating the -OP-POSS sequence as a state different from -OP followed

by -POSS, in which -POSS is not interpreted with the semantics of possession but that
of agreement marking). Not knowing how many of the syntactic distinctions are han-
dled by the morphological analyzer, a subsequent interpreter may need to reconsult
the grammar if scoping problems arise.
The architecture in Figure 3c describes the current implementation of the pro-
posal. Bound morphemes are fed to the parser along with their interpretation. This
model is preferred over that presented in Figure 3b for its simplicity in design and
extendibility.16 The price is lesser efficiency due to context-free processing of inflec-
tional morphology. By one estimate (Oflazer, Gocmen, and Bozsahin 1994), Turkish
has 59 inflectional morphemes out of a total of 166 bound morphemes, and Oflazer
(personal communication) notes that the average number of bound morphemes per
word in unrestricted corpora is around 2.8, including derivational affixes. In a news
corpus of 850,000 words, the average number of inflections per word is less than two
(Oflazer et al 2001). This is tolerable for sentences of moderate length in terms of the
extra burden it puts on the context-free parser. Table 2 shows the results of our tests
with a Prolog implementation of the system on different kinds of constructions. The
test cases included 10 lexical items on average, with an average parsing time of 0.32
seconds per sentence. A relatively long sentence (12 words, 21 morphemes) took 2.9
seconds to parse. The longest sentence (20 words, 37 morphemes) took 40 seconds.
The lexicon for the experiment included 700 entries; 139 were free morphemes and
561 were bound morphemes compiled out of 105 allomorphic representations (includ-
ing all the ambiguous interpretations of bound morphemes and the results of lexical
rules). For a rough comparison with an existing NLP system with no disambiguation
16 The morphological analyzer would be in no better position to handle morpheme?semantics pairing if
the architecture in Figure 3b were implemented with an integrated lexicon of roots and affixes. For
instance, -POSS would still require distinct states because of the difference in the semantics of
possession and agreement marking coming from the lexicon.
162
Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 2
aids, Gu?ngo?rdu? and Oflazer (1995) reported average parsing times of around 10 sec-
onds per sentence for a lexicon of 24,000 free morphemes, and their morphological
analyzer delivered around two analyses per second to a lexemic grammar. Oflazer?s
later (1996) morphological analyzer contained an abstract morphotactic component of
around 50 states for inflections, which resulted in compilation to 30,000 states and
100,000 transitions when the morphophonemic rules were added to the system.
In conclusion, we note that the current proposal for a morphemic lexicon and
grammar is compatible with both a separate morphological component (Figure 3b) and
syntax-integrated inflectional morphology (Figure 3c). The architecture in Figure 3b
may in fact be more suitable for inflecting languages (e.g., Russian) in which the
surface forms of bound morphemes are difficult to isolate (e.g., me?ste, locative singular
of me?sto) but can be delivered as a sequence of morpheme labels by a morphological
analyzer (e.g. me?sto-SING-LOC) to be matched with the lexical type assignments to
-SING and -LOC for grammatical interpretation.
It might be argued that in computational models of the type in Figure 3b, the lattice
is not necessary, because the morphological analyzer embodies the tactical component.
But not only tactical problems (cf. Example (18) and its discussion) but also transparent
scoping in syntax and semantics is regulated by the use of lattice in type assignments,
and that is our main concern. We show examples of such cases in the remainder of the
article. Thus the nonredundant role of the lattice decouples the morphemic grammar?
lexicon from the kind of morphological analysis performed in the back end.
5. Case Study: The English Plural
In this section, we present a morphosyntactic treatment of the English plural mor-
pheme. The lattice for English is shown in Figure 2b. We follow Carpenter (1997) in
categorizing numerical modifiers and intersective adjectives as plural noun modifiers:
four boys is interpreted as four(plu boy) and green boxes as green(plu box). This bracketing
reflects the ?set of sets? interpretation of the plural noun; four(plu boy) denotes the set
of nonempty nonsingleton sets of boys with four members. The type assignments in
(20) correctly interpret the interaction of the plural and these modifiers (cf. 21a?b).
The endotypic category of the plural also allows phrase-internal number agreement
for languages that require it; the agreement can be regulated over the category N
before the specifier is applied to the noun group to obtain NP.

Carpenter (1997) points out that nonintersective adjectives (e.g, toy, fake, alleged) are
unlike numerical modifiers and intersective adjectives in that their semantics requires
phrasal (wide) scope for -PLU, corresponding to the ?set of things? interpretation
of the plural noun. Thus, toy guns is interpreted as plu(toy gun) because the plural
outscopes the modification. It denotes a nonempty nonsingleton set of things that are
not really guns but toy guns. *toy(plu gun) would interpret plu over guns. The situation
is precisely the opposite of (21); we need the second derivational pattern to go through
and the first one to fail. The following category for nonintersective adjectives derives
the wide scope for -PLU but not the narrow scope:
(22) toy :=
s? toy ?

Carpenter (1997) avoided rebracketing because of the plural through lexical type
assignments to plural nouns and a phonologically null lexical entry to obtain differ-
ent semantic effects of the plural. In our formulation, there is no lexical entry for
inflected forms and no phonologically null type assignment to account for the dis-
tinction in different types of plural modification; there is only one (phonologically
realized) category for -PLU.17 The modifiers differ only in the kind and degree of mor-
phosyntactic control. Strict control (?) on four disallows four boy, and flexible control
(< ) on green also handles green box. Four green boxes is interpreted as four(green(plu box)),
17 This is not to say that there is only one model-theoretic interpretation of plu. ?Sets of sets? and ?set of
individuals? valuations of plu can be carried over the PAS.

not as *four(plu(green box)), and four toy guns is interpreted as four(plu(toy gun)), not as
*plu(four(toy gun)). These derivations preserve the domain of the modifiers and the
plural without rebracketing.
6. Case Study: Turkish Morphosyntax
There have been several computational studies to model morphology?syntax inter-
action in Turkish. These unification-based approaches represent varying degrees of
integration. Gu?ngo?rdu? and Oflazer (1995) isolates morphology from syntax by having
separate modules (a finite-state transducer for the former, and an LFG component for
the latter), that is, the syntax is lexemic. The morphological component is expected to
handle all aspects of morphology, including inflections and derivations. In Sehitoglu
and Bozsahin (1999), lexical rules implement inflectional morphology, and derivations
are assumed to take place in the lexicon. Hoffman?s (1995) categorial analysis of Turk-
ish is also lexemic; all lexical entries are fully inflected. Interpretive components of
these systems face the aforementioned difficulties because of their commitment to lex-
emic syntax. Inflectional morphology is incorporated into syntax in another categorial
approach (Bozsahin and Go?c?men 1995), but morphotactic constraints are modeled with
nonmonotonic unification, such as nonexistence checks for features and overrides. The
system cannot make finer distinctions in morphosyntactic types either. The result is an
overgenerating and nontransparent integration of morphology and syntax because of
the possibility of rebracketing and the unresolved representational basis of the lexicon.
In this section, we outline the application of the proposed framework to Turkish.
We analyze a large fragment of the language, without any claims for a comprehensive
grammar. The phenomena modeled here exhibit particular morphosyntactic problems
described in the preceding sections. We assume the binding theory in Steedman (1996),
which is predicated over the PAS. In each section, we provide a brief empirical observa-
tion about the phenomenon, propose lexical type assignments, exemplify derivations
of the parser, and briefly discuss the constraints imposed by morphosyntactic types.
Because of space considerations, we sometimes use abbreviated forms in derivations
such as the genitive affix?s (N/(N\N))\N category for (
o
< N/(
o
?Npn\
o
?Npn))\
o
< Npn,
but the parser operates on full morphosyntactic representations.
6.1 Case Marking and Word Order
Turkish is regarded as a free constituent order language; all permutations of the
predicate and its arguments are grammatical in main clauses, being subject to con-
straints on discourse and semantic properties such as definiteness and referentiality
of the argument and topic?focus distinctions. The mapping of surface functions to
grammatical relations is mediated by case marking. Word order variation has lesser
functionality in embedded clauses because embedded arguments are less accessible
to surface discourse functions like topic and focus. Embedded clauses are verb fi-
nal.
6.1.1 Lexical Types. We start with the lexical type assignments for the verbs. We use
the abbreviations in (24a) when no confusion arises about the arguments? case or mor-
phosyntactic type. Verb-final orders are regarded as basic, which suggests the category
S\NP\NP for transitive verbs. But Janeway (1990) argued that such underspecification
for verb-peripheral languages causes undesirable ambiguity. Grammatical relations of
165
Bozsahin The Combinatory Morphemic Lexicon
the arguments are determined not by directionality but by case in such languages. The
category S\NPnom\NPacc resolves the ambiguity (24b?c).
(24) a. IV = S\NP
TV = S\NP\NP
DV = S\NP\NP\NP
b. sev (like) :=

f. -LOC :=
a? de|da|te|ta ? (

o
< N:?x.?f .at fx
Gapping behavior seems to indicate that Turkish is verb final, not just SOV. SO
and OS syntactic types must be distinguished to account for SO & SOV, OS & OSV,
*SO & OSV and *OS & SOV. The OS & OSV pattern requires the lexical category
S\NPacc\NPnom for the verb (Bozsahin 2000b). SOV and OSV base orders can be cap-
tured uniquely in the lexicon in set-CCG notation as S\{NPacc,NPnom}. Set-CCG is
strongly equivalent to CCG (Baldridge 1999). We distinguish SOV and OSV lexically,
however, because OSV requires referential objects (25a?b). OSV is generated from SOV
by a lexical rule (24d). This is genuine lexical ambiguity, because the two related entries
differ in semantics (referentiality).
(25) a. Kitab-? adam oku-du
Book-ACC man.NOM read-TENSE
?The man read the book.?
b. *Kitap adam oku-du
Book man.NOM read-TENSE
Regarding the relationship between case and the specifiers, it is questionable
whether Turkish has a discernible syntactic category for determiners. There is no lex-
ical functor that takes an N and yields an NP. The only article, the indefinite bir (?a?),
makes a distinction in discourse properties (26). Specifying case as a determiner (e.g.,
NP\N) does not alleviate the problem, either. Ignoring the problem of case stacking
for a moment, zero marking of the surface subject and the indefinite object takes us
back to where we started.

?The child ate green apple.? (indefinite and nonreferential apple)
?The child ate the green apple.? (definite and referential apple)

Making the nouns lexically ambiguous (N or NP) would also require that all func-
tions onto nouns be ambiguous (N\N and NP\NP for inflections, N/N and NP/NP for
adjectives, etc.). Redundancy of this kind in the lexicon is not desirable, since it is in-
troduced purely for formal reasons with no distinction in meaning. We accommodate
these concerns by positing a special case of type raising for Turkish (27). Similarly,
contraposition turns Ns into functors looking for NPs.
(27) Type Raising for Turkish: Nagr : a ? T/(T\
f
< NPagr):?f .f [a]
? T\(T/
f
< NPagr):?f .f [a]
T ? {S,S\NP,S\NP\NP, S\NP\NP\NP}
The noun that is type raised can be a syntactically derived noun (28). SO (and OS)
constituency required for gapping is provided by >T and >B.

Our lexical type assignment to case morphemes (24e?f) departs from other CCG
analyses of case (e.g., Steedman 1985, 1991a, Bozsahin 1998). These studies correlate
morphological case with type raising of arguments, in the case of Bozsahin (1998), via
a value-raised category assignment to case morphemes. Evidence from NP-internal
case agreement and case stacking (Kracht 1999) challenges the type-raising approach.
Agreement phenomena require that case (which can be marked on articles, adjectives,
and nouns) be regulated as an agreement feature within the category N before the
case-marked argument looks for the verb via type raising. Kracht observes that, in
case stacking, there may be other morphemes between two case morphemes. Thus,
treating the two cases as composite affixes for the purpose of type raising is not
feasible. If the first case type-raises the noun to say, T/(T\NP), the second case would
require a category, (T/(T\NP))\(T/(T\NP)); that is, it is endotypic. Hence, an endotypic
category for case (like other inflections in the paradigm) subsumes the type-raising
analysis of case provided that type raising is available in the grammar, not necessarily
anchored to case.
We analyze case as an endotypic functor of type N\N (24e)?hence allow for
phrase-internal agreement for languages that require it and provide type raising in
grammar as in (27). Abandoning the type-raising analysis of case does not necessitate
taking liberties in the directionality of the categories, such as the use of nondirectional
slash (|) in multiset-CCG (Hoffman 1995). Contraposition and type raising in grammar
167
Bozsahin The Combinatory Morphemic Lexicon
can account for free word order and gapping facts with fully directional syntactic types
(Bozsahin 2000a).
6.1.2 Derivations. The wide scope of case is captured by treating its argument type as
non-case-marked N (
o
< N) and the type of noun modifiers as functions onto non-case-
marked nouns of a particular domain, for example,
b
< N for nonintersective adjectives
and
n
< N for intersective adjectives (29a). The same strategy in type assignments to
other nominal inflections allows them to outscope nominal modification, for exam-
ple, (29b).

A word-based alternative for reconciling the semantic (wide) scope of inflections
and their morphological (narrow) attachment to stems runs into difficulties even if
we assume that morphemes carry type assignments?and hence have representational
status?but that they always combine with stems first. We use syntactic types to show
the problem. If -PLU and -ACC in (29a) combine with the stem first, only the narrow-
scope reading of the plural and case is possible (30a). Plu(toy car) is not derivable with
168
Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 2
word-based modification. The morphosyntactic categories, however, are transparent
to the scope of nominal modification (cf. (29a) and (30b)).

Surface case annotations on categories enable the grammar to capture the correct
PAS in all permutations of S, O, and V while maintaining the discourse-relevant dis-
tinctions (31). Verb-final subordinate clauses are enforced by the directionality of the
subordination morphemes in the lexicon.

6.2 Subordination
Subordinate clauses can be classified as unmarked clauses (32a), infinitival clauses
(32b), verbal nouns (32c), and nominalizations (32d). The latter two types require a
genitive embedded subject, which agrees with the subordinate verb.

6.2.1 Lexical Types. The asymmetries in (33) show that the obliqueness order in bind-
ing relations is preserved in subordination. This suggests the following bracketing, in
which the embedded clause?s position in the PAS of the matrix predicate is determined
by its grammatical function.
Matrix-Pred . . . Matrix-Argument . . . Embedded-Clause . . . Matrix-Argument
(34) -SUB1i (-ma) :=
a? ma ?
b
< N\(
a
< S\
f
< NPnom):?f .f
(infinitive)
-SUB1g (-mas?) :=
a? mas? ?

f

a? d?g?? ?
o
< Ncase=obl\
f
< NPagr\(
a
< S\
f
< NPnom):?f .f
(nominalization)
The wide scope of case markers on subordinate clauses implies that the subor-
dinate markers themselves must have phrasal scope as well. Since case is a nominal
inflection, the category of a subordinate marker must be a function onto N. Its ar-
gument is IV for infinitives and NPagr\IV for others, which require genitive subjects
(34). This yields two families of functors for subordination. The verb-final characteris-
tics of the embedded clauses is ensured by the backward-looking main functor of the
subordinate marker.
For morphosyntactic modality, the resulting nominalized predicate can receive
only case, hence it has
o
< N control. Verbal nouns refer to actions, and nominaliza-
tions refer to facts. Subordinate markers for the former are tenseless. A subordinate
marker replaces the tense of the subordinate verb in nominalizations, yielding
a
< S
171
Bozsahin The Combinatory Morphemic Lexicon
control on the verb. For subject raising, the result may undergo any nominal inflection
(
b
< N).
Word order variation within the subordinate clause is constrained by the subject
on the left and the verb on the right. This constraint is achieved by categorizing the
embedded subjects as NPagr and having a result category of N for all subordinate mark-
ers. If there were any contraposed element NP in the embedded clause, the category
of the clause would be S\NP, and the clause could not combine with the contraposed
category such as S?t\(S\NP) on the right because the extraction category combines
with a subordinate marker first, which is onto N, not S\NP, hence composition (<B)
could not take place.
6.2.2 Derivations. Example (35a) is the derivation of subject raising (we use N? as
an abbreviation for a type-raised N when space is limited). We use Steedman?s (1996)
ana function to denote the binding of the embedded subject. Infinitive -SUB1i has
phrasal scope in this example; the DV must be reduced to an IV before the infinitive
can apply. Hence the subordination of intransitive clauses is only a special case in
which the morphological scope of the infinitive works without rebracketing. Subject
raising and coindexation with the matrix subject are made explicit in the raising cate-
gory of unut. The systematic relationship between the raised and nonraised category
of such verbs can be captured by a lexical rule, for example, TV:?x.?y.forget xy ?
TV:?f .?y.forget(f [ana y])y.
(35b?c) contrast subject and nonsubject nominalizations. The difference is cap-
tured with the case distinction of the result type (
o
< N) for -SUB1g and -SUB2g. These
examples also show the possibility of affix composition in the lexicon. For instance,
we write -mas? in (35b), which marks subordination and agreement together, instead
of -ma-s?. Otherwise, -ma (SUB1g) would have to look to the right as a functor to
enforce agreement, and the verb-final property of subordination could not be as-
sured.

6.3 The Morphosyntax of Control
The control verb?s controlled argument is marked by the infinitive -ma, and the re-
sulting nominalized embedded clause can undergo nominal inflections (36a?b). The
infinitive -ma has the lexical type in (34). A potential conflict between an object con-
trol verb?s subcategorization and PAS is resolved by case decoration: zorla ?force? and
tavsiye et ?recommend? differ in their case requirements and what is controlled (36b?c).
tavsiye et?s infinitive complement is accusative, whereas zorla?s is dative.

6.3.1 Lexical Types. Subject control verbs (e.g., c?al?s? ?try?; so?z ver ?promise?) and object
control verbs (e.g., zorla; tavsiye et) have the control property indicated in their PAS
(37). The nonraising variety of these verbs is obtained via a lexical rule.
(37) c?al?s? :=
s? c?al?s? ? TV:?q.?z.try(q[ana z])z
so?z ver :=
s? so?z ver ? DV:?q.?z.?w.promise z(q[anaw])w

tavsiye et :=

6.3.2 Derivations. The types in (37), coupled with the raising category of the infinitive,
yield the derivations in (38). These examples compose the infinitive complement before
a case can be applied on the nominalized predicate. This is possible because of the
phrasal scope of -ma and the case markers. (38b) shows that although there may be two
accusative-marked NPs, the arguments of the infinitive complement are identifiable;
the IV scope of -ma implies that any (di)transitive subordinate verb must find its
nonsubject arguments before the matrix verb gets its arguments. This type assignment
strategy handles word order variations inside the infinitive complement and the matrix
clause transparently.

6.4 Relativization
There are two strategies for forming relative clauses: the subject participle strategy
(SP) and the nonsubject participle strategy (OP). SP is realized by the affixes -(y)An,
-(y)AcAk, and -mIs?, and OP by -dIk- and -(y)AcAk-. OP triggers agreement similar to
that of possessive constructions between the subject and the predicate of the relative
clause (39b).

of constituents onto S\NP.

We present a formulation of relativization without any use of empty categories,
traces, or movement. We follow the Montagovian treatment of relative clauses as noun
restrictors of the semantic type ?P.?Q.and(Q[x])(P[x]), where P is the semantics of the
relative clause and Q is the semantics of the predicate taking the relativized noun
(x) as the argument. Montagovian analysis assumes a generalized quantifier (GQ)
category for the determiner; that is, NP is the functor and VP is the argument. The
determiner takes the relativized noun (and its semantically type-raised category) as an
argument as well. In a language with determiners, the functor category of the overall
NP can be made explicit by lexically value-raising the determiner with GQ semantics
from, for example, NP/N to (S/(S\NP))/N = (S/VP)/N. To achieve the same effect in
a language that lacks determiners, we make NP the functor by lexically value-raising
the relative participle from (N/N)\(S\NP) to (N?/N)\(S\NP), in which N?/N denotes
a value-raised noun, since N? is a type-raised category. The category of the relative
participle unfolds to ((S/(S\NP))/N)\(S\NP) and (((S\NP)/(S\NP\NP))/N)\(S\NP).
Relativization is strictly head final in Turkish. This implies that all relative par-
ticiples are backward-looking functors that differ only in case requirements (cf. En-
glish relatives, which require different directionality, e.g., (N\N)/(S\NP) for subjects
and (N\N)/(S/NP) for nonsubjects). For morphosyntactic modality, the head noun has
175
Bozsahin The Combinatory Morphemic Lexicon
flexible control (
f
< N), because any further grammatical marking on the head must be
shared (41).

Morphologically, the agreement marker -POSS in OP strategy is a function over
the -OP morpheme, but syntactically, the -OP morpheme triggers the agreement in
the relative clause. Hence -OP-POSS can be treated as a lexically composite affix and
glossed as -OP.AGR. This also ensures the verb-final property of the relativized clause
by not positing a rightward-looking functor for -OP. As for attachment modality, rel-
ative participles are bound morphemes that are affixed to the predicate.
6.4.2 Derivations. (42a?d) show example derivations for subject, object, indirect object,
and adjunct relativization. All nonsubject arguments are handled by a single -OP type
(42b?c). Relativizing the specifier of an argument uses the same strategy as the argu-
ment. This phenomenon calls for another well-regulated lexical assignment schema,
for example, (N?/N)\(N\N)\IV for the relativized specifier of the subject. (42e) is an ex-
ample of relativizing the subject?s specifier. Configurationality within the noun group
is maintained by backward directionality of the categories.

As these examples indicate, -SP and -OP do not range over the verb stem in
semantic scope; they cover the entire relative clause. The wide scope of -SP and -OP
resolves the inconsistency pointed out in the introduction (5b?c), which was mainly
due to coindexation in unification accounts and the lexemic nature of the lexicon.
Isolating the relative participle inflections in a morphological component undermines
the transparency of derivations. Note also that -OP is categorially transparent to the
arity of the verb; a DV must be reduced to an IV before -OP applies to the verb
complex (42c). This is possible only when -OP has phrasal scope.

6.5 Ki-relativization
Ki-relativization is a morphosyntactic process that can generate indefinitely long words
of relative pronouns and relative adjectives. -ki can be attached to case-marked nouns
whose case relation is one of possession, time, or place (i.e., the genitive and the
locative). Its effect is to create a nominal stem on which all inflections can start again
(43a?b). It produces relative pronouns (43c) and relative adjectives (43d) with the
locative and relative pronouns with the genitive.

N?gen is a shorthand for the N/(N\N) category of a type-raised genitive. In (43c),
pronominal one (PRO) cannot be bound to ev (44a). Adjectival interpretation (43d)
associates the relative adjective with the relativized noun (44b). For morphosyntac-
tic modality, ki-marked nouns behave like possessive-marked nouns in case marking,
which requires strict control over the possessive (
o
?N). This presents a dilemma: Mor-
phologically, -ki creates a nominal stem that can undergo all nominal inflections again,
but, as (45a) indicates, the stem does not take the CASE (ACC, DAT, etc.) that is com-
mon to nouns unmarked on the possessive. Thus CASE2 in (45c) must refer to another
diacritic (n-relbase, or
l
? ) to eliminate (45b). This diacritic controls the result category
of -ki. The value-raised varieties of (44a?c) are assigned a type similar to the type of
relative participles. Inherently temporal nouns such as sabah (?morning?) can take -ki
178

without the locative. They can be lexicalized without overgeneration with the help of
the morphosyntactic modality

6.5.2 Derivations. -ki ranges over the case-marked noun, which, as (46a?b) indicate,
can be lexical or phrasal. In a lexemic analysis, the entire ki-marked noun would have
to be rebracketed before the adjective ku?c?u?k can apply to its right scope (which is ev,
not c?ocuk).

There is another ki in Turkish that forms nonrestrictive relative clauses as post-
modifiers. It is a Persian borrowing and follows the Indo-European pattern of relative
clause formation (47). It can be distinguished from the bound morpheme -ki lexically.
Its attachment characteristic is also different than that of -ki (44e).

6.6 Possessive Constructions and Syntactic Compounds
The grammatical marking of possession is realized through the genitive case on the
possessor (Ngen) and the possessive marker on the possessee (Nposs). Ngen and Nposs must
agree in person and number (48a), and the resulting noun group is configurational.
Possessives can be nested (48c).
(48) a. ev-in kap?-s?
house-GEN3 door-POSS3s
?the door of the house?
b. * ev-in kap? / *ev-in kap?-lar (door-PLU)
c. ben-im arkadas?-?m-?n ev-i-nin kap?-lar-?
I-GEN1 friend-POSS1s-GEN3 house-POSS3s door-PLU-POSS3s
?my friend?s house?s doors?
d. ben-im arkadas?-?m-?ni dost-u-nunj kendisi?i/j
I-GEN1 friend-POSS1s-GEN3 buddy-POSS3s-GEN3 self
?my friend?s buddy himself?
e. Her c?al?s?an-?n baz? hak-lar-? vard?r
every worker-GEN3 some right-PLU-POSS3s exists
?x?y((worker(x) ? right(y)) ? has(x, y))
but not ?y?x(right(y) ? (worker(x) ? has(x, y)))
6.6.1 Lexical Types for Possessives. Type assignments for the genitive and the pos-
sessive can be schematized over person (p) and number (n) features, as in (49).
(49) -GENpn :=
a? s ? (
o
< N/(
o
?Npn\
o
?Npn))\
o
< Npn:?x.?y.poss yx
-POSSpn :=
a? s ? ( o?Npn\
o
?Npn)\
n
< Npn:?f .f
The possessive marker?s result category is a functor because it enforces agreement
with the type raised specifier.18 (48d?e) indicate that the genitive marker is a type
raiser; the possessor scopes over the possessee. For morphosyntactic modality, the
genitive marker can be attached to nouns that are inflected up to and including a
possessive marker (
o
< N). Moreover, nesting in possessives implies that the specifier
may be a genitive. Hence, the stem?s category must be
o
< N.
But there is a finer control over the possessee argument?s category, because it must
be inflected with the possessive marker to signify relation of possession (cf. (48a?b)).
Semantically, the possessive must outscope nominal modification. For instance, (50a)
has the PAS as indicated, hence both markers must range over a noun group, not just
18 An ?inert? category such as N may be motivated by the prodrop phenomenon, in which the specifier
may be dropped under pragmatically conditioned circumstances. But this analysis disregards the point
that binding relations (hence semantics) still require the coindexation of the specifier with some overt
referent, which can be inferred from the discourse. Such an interface phenomenon seems to be better
suited for handling by interactions in the components of a multidimensional grammar, rather than as a
purely syntactic phenomenon.

the stem. Binding relations require an organization of the type (poss possee possessor)
(50b?c).

6.6.3 Lexical Types for Compounds. Syntactic compounds exhibit syntactic patterns
similar to possessive constructions, but they signify semantic relations of a different
kind. In what follows, we use the function comp to signify that the arguments in the
PAS form a compound but say nothing about the range of productivity of this function.
The lexical semantics of the arguments and a qualia structure (Pustejovsky 1991) may
indicate the function?s range of applicability. Lexical type assignments for compound
markers are as in (52).
(52) -COMP :=
a? s ? m?N\
n
< N\ b?N:?x.?y.comp xy
-COMP2 :=
a? s ? m?N\ m?N\
n
< N\ b?N:?x.?y.?z.comp(comp xy)z
(nested comp)
Syntactic compounds are formed by means of compound markers that are attached
to the head of the compound. For morphosyntactic modality, nonreferentiality of the
head implies no inflection (
b
?N) or modification (53a?b). The left component can be
a noun group (53c) in which there is ambiguity in the scope of modification. This
is regulated by typing, for example, the intersective adjectives ambiguous as noun
modifiers (
n
< N/
n
< N) and compound modifiers (
m
?N/
m
?N).19 The overall compound
may be inflected only for case (see, e.g., (53d) and (53e)).
(53) a.otobu?s bilet-i
bus ticket-COMP
?bus ticket?
b.*otobu?s yes?il bilet-i
green
c.yes?il otobu?s bilet-i
green bus ticket-COMP
green(comp ticket bus)
or comp(ticket(green bus))
d.otobu?s bilet-i-ni
ticket-COMP-ACC2
e.*otobu?s bilet-i-si
ticket-COMP-POSS
Compound markers serve the dual function of compounding and agreement in
possessive constructions; double marking of the possessive is suppressed (cf. 54a?b).
The -COMP2 type assignment in (52) handles nested compounds.
(54) a.banka-n?n faiz oran-?
bank-GEN interest rate-COMP.POSS
?interest rate of the bank?
b.*banka-n?n faiz oran-?-s?
rate-COMP-POSS
We claim that plural compounds are lexically composite functions in a similar
vein. This claim has some empirical support from the lexicalization of -leri as a
third person plural possessive marker; see (55b?c). It follows that -leri has the lexi-
19 I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer who proposed this alternative.

cal types of -COMP and -COMP2 with plural and possessive composition: ?x.?y.plu

6.6.4 Derivation of Compounds. (56) exemplifies derivations with the type assign-
ments in (52). (56a?b) show that both the narrow and the wide scope of the modifier
can be accounted for. (56c?d) show that the compound marker interacts with the pos-
sessive. Hence, it must carry both poss and comp in possessive constructions involving
compounds. (56e?f) are examples of nested compounds. (56f?g) show the effect of
strict control (
b
?N) over the compound?s head.

7. Conclusion
Theoretical and computational commitment to word-based grammar?and to regard
inflectional morphology as a word-internal process?puts artificial limits on specify-
ing the syntactic and semantic domains of all meaning-bearing elements and on the
transparent projection of scope from the lexicon. Designating words as minimal units
of the lexicon is too constraining for many languages. This traditional notion is also
challenged in current linguistic theorizing (e.g., Jackendoff 1997 and Keenan and Sta-
bler 1997). Marslen-Wilson (1999) argues on psycholinguistic grounds that the lexicon
must be morphemic even for morphologically simpler languages such as English.
We have argued in this article that the key to the integration of inflectional mor-
phology and syntax is granting representational status to morphemes, which, in a
computational system, requires certain precautions. What we propose is enriching the
expressive power of the combinatory morphemic lexicon to factor in morphosyntactic
types and attachment modalities. Coupled with flexible constituency in the grammar
and directionality information coming from the lexicon, these extensions provide the
grammar with the information it requires to compute the transparent semantics of
morphosyntactic phenomena. This flexibility causes neither inefficiency in parsing nor
uncontrolled expressivity. The extensions do not affect the polynomial worst-case com-
plexity results, and category unity is preserved by lattice consistency. The result is a
morphemic grammar?lexicon with computationally desirable features such as mod-
ularity and transparency. The system is available at ftp://ftp.lcsl.metu.edu.tr/pub/
tools/msccg.

Abstract
In this paper we explain how we anno-
tated subordinators in the Turkish Dis-
course Bank (TDB), an effort that started
in 2007 and is still continuing. We in-
troduce the project and describe some of
the issues that were important in anno-
tating three subordinators, namely kars??n,
rag?men and halde, all of which encode the
coherence relation Contrast-Concession.
We also describe the annotation tool.
1 Introduction
The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a project
initiated by the joint effort of a group of re-
searchers in Turkey. The project builds on an ex-
isting corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus
(MTC) (Say et al, 2002), and extends it to a dis-
course level resource by following the principles
of the PDTB (Prasad et al, 2007) in annotating
discourse connectives and their arguments. The 2-
million-word MTC contains 520 continuous texts
from various genres written between 1991-2000.
From a semantic perspective, we take discourse
connectives as predicates that take as their argu-
ments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract ob-
ject interpretations. Abstract objects are proposi-
tions, facts, events, situations, etc. (Asher, 1993).
Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly
or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al, 2007).
Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexi-
cal items that encode a discourse relation, while
implicit connectives can be inferred from related
text spans that have coherence relations. The TDB
project aims to annotate explicit connectives only.
In Turkish, discourse connectives are identified
with three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Web-
ber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Sub-
ordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric
0Corresponding author: dezeyrek@metu.edu.tr
connectives). All these discourse connectives have
two and only two arguments, which are conve-
niently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.1 ARG2 is
always the argument that syntactically hosts the
connective.
The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourse
connectives is consistent with the following ob-
servations in discourse: Sentences in discourse
are coherently related, and therefore when ex-
plicit discourse connectives are used, if they are
really discourse connectives, they are bound to
set up a relation between a consequent clause and
its antecedent. (Note that the ARG2 designation
does not imply that ARG2 is consequent or an-
tecedent.) In certain cases presupposition needs a
mediator, viz. the discourse connective. Noncon-
nectival discourse relations are certainly possible,
but connective-engendered discourse relations are
claimed to be more specific about their semantics,
e.g. they bring about presuppositional meaning
(van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al, 1999).
In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification is
unlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lex-
ical property of functors (e.g. verbs) which are
not necessarily presuppositional and hence they
can differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive,
unergative, unaccusative etc.).
2 The Data
The MTC is preprocessed to obtain the raw texts
keeping the title, author, publishing date and the
text type information at the beginning of each file.
Stand-off annotation is done on the textual render-
ing of the MTC.
To enable the data to be viewable universally
without losing any character information, the file
format (originally xcs) was converted to text, and
the character encoding (originally Turkish-ISO-
1Whether or not discourse connectives in any language
take more than two arguments is an open question that needs
to be established in further research.

Table 1: File count and percentage information according to text type for the preprocessed MTC and its

processed MTC data were divided into four sub-
corpora by keeping the text type distribution, file
count and word count as equal as possible in each
subcorpus. The text type distribution, file count
and word percentage information in each subcor-
pus are given in Table 1. In the project, we plan to
annotate subcorpus 1.
3 Subordinating Conjunctions in
Turkish: A Brief Overview
Subordinators have two subtypes. Converbs are
suffixes attached directly to verb roots. For exam-
ple, the suffix -(y)ArAk ?by (means of)? requires
as its ARG2 a nominalized adverbial clause as in
(1). Complex subordinators, e.g. rag?men ?despite,
although?, kars??n ?although?, halde ?despite, along
with?, ic?in causal ?since?, purposive ?so as to?, etc.
mostly take case-marked nominalized clauses as
their ARG2.
(1) Hu?ku?met ... uyum paketini onaylayarak ...
Erdog?an?n o?nu?ndeki engellerden birini kald?rd?.
By approving the adaptation package ..., the
government alleviated one of the obstacles for
Erdog?an ...
In this paper, we will not deal with converbs.
We will also not deal with connectives taking as
their ARG2 a finite clause because none of these
subtypes have been annotated yet. We will focus
on three postpositions taking a nominalized clause
as ARG2, namely rag?men, kars??n and halde, all of
which encode the Contrast-Concession relation.
In the PDTB, such clauses were not annotated as
arguments. However, in Turkish, they are so com-
mon as arguments of subordinators that we would
have missed an important property of Turkish dis-
course if we did not annotate them. In the rest
of the paper, we provide examples taken from the
MTC. We underline the connective, show ARG2
in bold letters and render ARG1 in italics.
3.1 The minimality principle
As in the PDTB, the minimality principle is in-
voked, according to which clauses, parts of clauses
or sentences that are minimally necessary and suf-
ficient for the discourse relation engendered by
the connective are annotated as ARG1 or ARG2
(Prasad et al, 2007). Any other text span that
is perceived to be important for the interpretation
of the discourse relation can be selected as sup-
plementary information in addition to ARG1 or
ARG2.
3.2 Morphological properties of the
arguments and their relative ordering
In Turkish, subordinate clauses are essentially
nominalizations, which may be formed by -DIK
or -mA suffixes (the factive nominal and the action
nominal, respectively (Kornfilt, 1997)).
Two of the connectives, i.e. rag?men and kars??n
expect action nominals, the person agreement suf-
fix, and the dative suffix -(y)A on their ARG2. On
the other hand, the connective halde expects a fac-
tive nominal and the person agreement suffix. In
the examples below, we show these suffixes with
glosses on the English translations.
The arguments of subordinators are necessarily
adjacent and mostly exhibit the ARG2-ARG1 or-
der because Turkish is a left-branching language
and subordinate clauses are on the left in canonical
order. ARG2 can be postposed for backgrounding
purposes or to express new and unexpected infor-
mation, as in (2).
(2) ... ayn? annesine oldu]ugu gibi ona da, kimseye
ba/uglanmayanlar kolayca bag?lan?yordu; u?stelik o
o?yle bir bag??ml?l?k talep etmedig?i halde.
... just as it happened to her mother, people who
can?t easily commit themselves to anyone would
45
easily commit themselves to her, although she
would not ask-FACTN-AGR for such a commit-
ment.
3.3 Issues in annotating the arguments
One of the challenges we have faced so far is the
question of how to annotate connectives which are
themselves a converb suffix (e.g. -(y)ArAk, as in
(1)) or postpositions that choose a case-marked
ARG2 as in (2). In both cases, we decided to an-
notate ARG2 by selecting the clause without sepa-
rating the suffixes. In this way, we would not inter-
fere with the annotators? intuitions since we would
not be demanding them to have conscious knowl-
edge of the morphological constraints on the ar-
guments. This style of annotation was welcomed
by the annotators. When all the annotations are
completed, we plan to separate the suffixes with a
morphological parser to provide a full view of the
morphology of the arguments.
Another issue was how to annotate shared sub-
jects in subordinate clauses. Turkish allows sub-
ject pro-drop and in complex sentences, the shared
subject is shown by the person agreement suffix
on the verb of the consequent clause. To capture
this fact, we chose to exclude shared subjects from
the annotation of the arguments. This style of
annotation conforms to the minimality principle.
As illustrated in (3), the subject, Neriman, which
appears in its canonical clause-initial position in
ARG2 is not selected because the verb of the sub-
sequent clause carries the person agreement suffix.
(3) Neriman yatak odas?nda sigara ic?ilmesini is-
temedig?i halde s?imdilik sigaraya ses c??karm?yor.
Although Neriman does not want-FACTN-AGR
people to smoke in her bedroom, (she) doesn?t
say-AGR anything for the moment.2
If the subject is not shared, it is included in the
annotation, even if it causes discontinuity. As it
is illustrated in (4), ARG2 intervenes in ARG1 by
separating it from its subject.
(4) Rukiye, kendisinden u?c? yas? ufak olmas?na
rag?men, erkek kardes?ini kendi og?lu san?yordu, ...
Rukiye, although (he) is-ACTN-AGR-DAT three
years younger than herself, thought-AGR that her
brother was her son...
2The pronoun is in parentheses to reflect pro-drop. The
following abbreviations are used on the translations to show
the morphological characteristics of the clauses: ACTN: Ac-
tion nominal, FACTN: Factive nominal, AGR: Person agree-
ment suffix, DAT: Dative case, ABL: Ablative case. NOM:
Nominative case.
Example (5) shows that two nominalized
clauses can be selected as the arguments of the
subordinator kars??n leaving out the shared sub-
ject. In this example, the subject is shown between
square brackets for clarity. Note that, ARG1 is
also a nominalized clause since it is embedded un-
der the attribution verb so?yle - ?say?.3
(5) ... [herkes yarat?lan toplumsal deg?erden verdig?i
emek oran?nda pay alacak bic?imindeki sosyalist
iktisat ilkesinin] asl?nda c?ok es?itlikc?i gibi
go?zu?kmesine kars??n es?itsizlig?i engelleye-
meyeceg?ini, ... so?yler
... says that ... despite (it) looks-ACTN-AGR-
DAT quite egalitarian, [the socialist principle,
stating that everyone gets a share proportional to
his labor] will not prevent-ACTN-AGR inequality
...
Finally, in annotating adjuncts, we follow the
same principle we followed in annotating shared
subjects. For instance in (6), the adjunct yemekte
?at dinner? is not annotated since it is shared by the
arguments of the connective rag?men.
(6) Gu?l de yemekte kilo ald?rmas?na rag?men S?am
tatl?lar?ndan c?ok hos?land?g??n? ifade etti.
At dinner, Gu?l-NOM, also said that although
(theyi) are-ACTN-AGR-DAT fattening, (he)
likes Damascus deserts-ABLi very much.
4 The Annotation Process
Before the annotation procedure started, a set of
annotation guidelines were prepared. The guide-
lines include the basic principles, such as what
discourse connectives are, where in the discourse
one can find ARG1 and ARG2, how to annotate
shared subjects, adjuncts, etc. Rather than being
strict rules, the guidelines are aimed at being gen-
eral principles guiding the annotators in their de-
cision of selecting the text span that is minimally
sufficient for interpreting the discourse relation en-
coded by the connective.
The annotation cycle consisted of 1) annotat-
ing a connective by at least three different people
2) measuring the agreement among them with the
inter-anotator agreement tool 3) resolving the dis-
agreements with an anonymous decision.
4.1 The annotation tool
We have an XML-based infrastructure for annota-
tion. It aims to produce searchable and trackable
data. Stand-off annotation has well-known advan-
tages such as the ability to see layers separately, or
3In the PDTB, attribution is not taken as a discourse re-
lation but it is annotated. Attribution is not annotated in the
TDB.

to distribute annotation without data due to licens-
ing constraints. To this list we can add the em-
pirical necessity that, the crossing links in a single
layer of same kind of annotation might not be easy
to do inline. They can be done inline using SGML
OCCURS checks, but they are easier to annotate
in stand-off mode.
The tool has a regular expression mode in which
the annotator can use his/her knowledge of Turk-
ish word structure to collect similarly inflected
words without morphological analysis. For exam-
ple, -ArAk$, in which the uppercase forms repre-
sent metaphonemes, will bring words ending with
the allomorphs of the converb suffix due to vowel
harmony: erek, arak etc.
5 Conclusion
The TDB project is a first attempt in creating an
annotated resource for written Turkish discourse.
The annotation process is still continuing. In this
paper, the emphasis was on a small number of con-
nectives, namely three postpositions, which form a
subclass of subordinators. The paper described the
role of certain morpho-syntactic facts in interpret-
ing the coherence relation between two clauses,
and how these facts were reflected in the annota-
tions.
Three subjects separately annotated each of the
subordinators on the annotation tool, and inter-
rater reliability was calculated. The statistics were
obtained from Cochran?s Q test to the ARG1 and
ARG2 spans. The annotation data were encoded
with 1 if the character is in the span and 0 if it
is not. The encoded data were put to the Q test.
All the results were above the minimum success
probability (>0.05), showing that the annotations
were consistent (see Table 2). We will run another
Cochran experiment in which we will test whether
the annotators agree on ARG1/ARG2 boundaries,
rather than just word inclusion in the text spans as
above.
Given the distribution of agreements, Cochran
provides the number of subjects who must agree
so that a text span can be reliably considered an
ARG1 or ARG2. This we believe is important to
report with the final product (to be made public
soon), so that its gold standard can be assessed by

Abstract
In this paper, we describe an annotation
environment developed for the marking of
discourse structures in Turkish, and the
kinds of discourse relation configurations
that led to its design.
1 Introduction
The property that distinguishes a discourse from a
set of arbitrary sentences is defined as coherence
(Halliday and Hasan, 1976). Coherence is estab-
lished by the relations between the units of dis-
course.
Systematic analysis of coherence requires an
annotated corpus in which coherence relations are
encoded. Turkish Discourse Bank Project (TDB)
aims to produce a large-scale discourse level an-
notation resource for Turkish (Zeyrek and Weber,
2008). The TDB follows the annotation scheme of
the PDTB (Miltsakaki et al 2004). The lexicalized
approach adopted in the TDB assumes that dis-
course relations are set up by lexical items called
discourse connectives. Connectives are consid-
ered as discourse level predicates which take ex-
actly two arguments. The arguments are ab-
stract objects like propositions, facts, events, etc.
(Asher, 1993). They can be linked either by ex-
plicitly realized connectives or by implicit ones
recognized by an inferential process. We anno-
tate explicit connectives; implicit connectives are
future work. We use the naming convention of the
PDTB. Conn stands for the connective, Arg1 and
Arg2 for the first and the second argument, respec-
tively. Conn, Arg1 and Arg2 are assumed to be
required components of discourse relations. Sup-
plementary materials which are relevant to but not
necessary for the interpretation are also annotated.
Our main data is METU Turkish Corpus(MTC)
(Say et al 2002). MTC is a written source of Turk-
ish with approximately 2 million words. The orig-
inal MTC files include informative tags, such as
the author of the text, the paragraph boundaries in
the text, etc. We removed these tags to obtain raw
text files and set the character encoding of the files
to ?UTF-8?. These conversions are useful for pro-
gramming purposes such as visualizing the data in
different platforms and the use of third-party li-
braries.
We developed an annotation environment to
mark up the discourse relations, which we call
DATT (Discourse Annotation Tool for Turkish).
DATT produces XML files as annotation data
which are generated by the implementation of a
stand-off annotation methodology. We present in
?2 the data from Turkish discourse, which forced
us to use stand-off annotation instead of in-line
markup. The key aspect is potential crossing of
the markup links. However, stand-off annotation
is also advantageous for separate licensing. We
present the design of data structure and the func-
tionality of the tool in ?3. We report some prelim-
inary results in the conclusion.
2 Dependency analysis of discourse
relations
The TDB has no a priori assumption on how the
predicates and arguments are placed. We need to
take into account potential cases to be able to han-
dle overlappings and crossings among relations.
We use the terminology proposed by Lee et al
(2006), and follow their convention for naming the
variations of structures we came across.
We looked at the connective tokens placed close
to each other, and made an initial investigation to
reveal how these predicates and their arguments
are located in the text. Preliminary analysis of the
data indicates that the components of two relations
are placed in 7 different ways, two of which are
special to Turkish (?2.5; ?2.6). This section is de-
voted to the descriptions of observed patterns with
202
representative examples.1
In the examples the connective (Conn) is
underlined, Arg1 is in italics and Arg2 is in bold-
face. A connective?s relative order with respect
to its own arguments is not shown in the graphi-
cal templates. It is made explicit in the subsequent
examples.
2.1 Independent relations
The predicate-argument structure of the connec-
tives are independent from each other (i.e., there
is no overlap between the arguments of different
connectives.) The template is (1). An example is
provided in (2).
(1)
(2) Ak?nt?ya kap?l?p umulmad?k bir geceyi
b?l?s?t? benimle ve bu kadarla kals?n
istedi belki. Eda a??s?ndan olay?n yorumu
bu kadar yal?n olmal?. Ama eg?er b?yleyse
benim i?in yorumlanmas? olanaks?z bir
d?s?ten bas?ka kalan yok geriye s?imdi.
She was drifted with a current and shared an
unexpected night with me and perhaps she
wanted to keep it this much only. From
the perspective of Eda, the interpretation of
the incident should be that simple. But, if this
is the case, now there is nothing left be-
hind for me but a dream impossible to in-
terpret.
In (2), the relation set up by Ama is fully preceded
by the relation set up by ve. There is no overlap
between the argument spans of the connectives ve
and Ama.
2.2 Full embedding
The text span of a relation constitutes an argument
of another connective (3). An example is provided
in (4).
(3)
(4)a. [..] madem yanl?s? bir yerde oldug?umuzu
d?s??n?yoruz da dog?ru denen yere asla
varamayacag??m?z? biliyoruz , senin gibi
biri nas?l b?yle bir soru sorar ,[..]
1All data in this paper are taken from MTC, unless stated
otherwise. More examples can be found in Aktas? (2008).
b. [..] madem yanl?s? bir yerde oldug?umuzu
d?s??n?yoruz da dog?ru denen yere asla
varamayacag??m?z? biliyoruz , senin gibi biri
nas?l b?yle bir soru sorar,[..]
[..] if we think that we are in a wrong place,
and we know that we will never never reach
the right place; how come a person like you
ask such a question? [..]
In (4), the span of the relation headed by da con-
stitutes the Arg2 of the connective madem.
2.3 Shared argument
Two different connectives can share the same ar-
gument (5).
(5)
In some situations, different connectives can share
both of their arguments as in the case of (6):
(6) Dedektif roman? i?inden ??k?lmaz gibi g?r?-
nen esrarl? bir cinayetin ??z?m?n? sundug?u
i?in, her s?eyden ?nce mant?g?a g?veni ve
inanc? dile getiren bir anlat? t?r?d?r ve
bundan ?t?r? de burjuva rasyonellig?inin
edebiyattaki ?z? haline gelmis?tir.
Unraveling the solution to a seemingly intri-
cate murder mystery, the detective novel is a
narrative genre which primarily gives voice
to the faith and trust in reason and being so,
it has become the epitome of bourgeois ra-
tionality in the literature.
2.4 Properly contained argument
The argument span of one connective encapsu-
lates the argument of another connective plus more
text (7).
(7)
An example is provided in (8), where Arg2 of ve
properly contains Arg1 of Tersine.
(8)a. Kap?dan girdi ve s?yler misin, hi? etkilen-
medin mi yazd?klar?ndan?, dedi. Tersine,
?ok etkilendim.
b. Kap?dan girdi ve s?yler misin, hi? etkilen-
medin mi yazd?klar?ndan?, dedi. Tersine,
?ok etkilendim.
203
S/he entered through the door and said ?Tell
me, are you not touched at all by what s/he
wrote??. On the contrary, I am very much
affected.
2.5 Properly contained relation
The argument span of one connective covers the
predicate-argument structure of another connec-
tive and more text (9), as exemplified in (10).
(9)
(10)a. Burada bizce bir ifade bozuklug?u veya ?e-
viri yanl?s?? bahis konusu olabilir, ??nk? el-
biseler sanki giyildig?i s?rece ve y?pran-
mam?s?ken y?kanamaz, fakat daha sonra
y?kanabilirmis? gibi bir anlam tas??mak-
tad?r.
b. Burada bizce bir ifade bozuklug?u veya ?e-
viri yanl?s?? bahis konusu olabilir, ??nk?
elbiseler sanki giyildig?i s?rece ve y?pran-
mam?s?ken y?kanamaz, fakat daha sonra
y?kanabilirmis? gibi bir anlam tas??maktad?r.
Here a mistake of expression or mistransla-
tion might be the case, because the meaning
is as if the clothes cannot be washed as long
as they are used and not worn out, but can
be washed later.
In (10), the second argument of ??nk? covers the
whole relation headed by fakat and the text ?gibi
bir anlam tas??maktad?r?, which is not part of it.
2.6 Nested relations
A relation is nested inside the span of another re-
lation (11).
(11)
In (12), the relation headed by da is properly
nested between the connective ve and its first ar-
gument.
(12) B?y?k bir masada g?nlerce, gecelerce otu-
rup konus?acag??z - konus?may? unuttum diy-
orum da g?l?yorlar bana - ve biriniz
kalk?p s?iir okuyacak.
We will sit and talk around a big table for
days and nights - I say I have forgotten how
to speak and they laugh at me - and one of
you will stand up and recite poetry.
2.7 Pure crossing
The dependency structure of a relation interleaves
with the arguments, or the connective of another
relation (13), as exemplified in (14).
(13)
(14)a. (Constructed) Kitab? okumaya bas?lad?m :
Okullar ?oktan a??lm?s?t?. Ard?ndan kap?n?n
?ald?g??n? duydum ama yerimden kalk-
madan okumaya devam ettim: Ama bu
okula hen?z ?g?retmen atanmam?s?t?.
b. Kitab? okumaya bas?lad?m Okullar ?oktan
a??lm?s?t?. Ard?ndan kap?n?n ?ald?g??n? duy-
dum ama yerimden kalkmadan okumaya de-
vam ettim: Ama bu okula hen?z ?g?retmen
atanmam?s?t?.
I started to read the book. The schools had
long been opened. Then, I heard the door
bell ring but I continued reading without
getting up: But a teacher had not been ap-
pointed to this school yet.
3 The tool
DATT is an XML-based infrastructure for text an-
notation. It aims to produce searchable and track-
able data. An initial investigation of connective
and argument locations revealed that there is ar-
gument sharing of various sorts, and nested and
crossing relations in Turkish discourse. The ex-
istence of such constructions lead us to use a
stand-off annotation rather than an in-line method.
These dependencies are violations of tree struc-
ture required by XML. Using the OCCURS fea-
ture of SGML for this purpose would lead to a less
portable markup tool.
3.1 Data representation
In stand-off markup, annotations are stored sepa-
rate from data. Since the base file is not modified
during annotation, it is guaranteed that all the an-
notators are dealing with the same version of the
data. The text spans of dependency constructions
are represented in terms of character offsets from
204
the beginning of the text file. This is a highly error-
prone way of storing annotation data. If there is a
shift in the character indexes in the original text
file, previously annotated data will be meaning-
less. To compensate for this, we keep the text
spans of annotations for recovery purposes.
Annotation files are well-formed XML files.
One can easily add new features to the annota-
tions. XML facilities available as online sources
such as the libraries for search and post-processing
reduce the implementation effort of adding new
features.
3.2 Search functionality
In the TDB, the annotation process is organized
according to connective types and their tokens.
The connective to be annotated is identified, and
all the relations which are set up by the instances
of that connective are marked. Therefore it is im-
portant to be able to find all the instances of a spe-
cific connective in the entire data source. DATT
has a search functionality which walks through all
resource files and shows the annotator which files
have the token. We used ?Apache Lucene Search
Library? for this functionality.
Two distinguishing characteristics of Turkish,
the vowel harmony and voicing, motivated us to
enhance the search facilities by adding support for
allomorphy. In Turkish, suffixes may have many
different forms. The ability to search on these
forms is crucial if connectives are attached to the
inflected forms of words, which is very frequently
the case. For instance, the ?-d?k?(the factive nom-
inal) suffix has eight allomorphs (i.e. -d?k, -dik,
-duk, -d?k, -t?k, -tik, -tuk, -t?k) depending on the
phonological environment.
In Turkish discourse, the meaning of a connec-
tive may change according to the inflectional cate-
gory of the word that precedes it. For example, the
word just before the connective?i?in? can be in-
flected with ?-d?k? and ?-mak?(the infinitive) suf-
fixes. With ?-d?k? the connective bears the mean-
ing of causal ?since?, while in the other case, the
connective has the meaning of ?so as to?(Zeyrek,
Webber, 2008). Because of this semantic differ-
ence, it will be important for the annotator to clus-
ter the instances of a connective token preceded by
all the forms of a certain inflectional suffix in one
search. DATT provides this opportunity with the
allomorph search support.
In Turkish, connectives can be inflected. For ex-
ample, the connective ?dolay?s?yla? (due to that)
is the inflected form of ?dolay??(due to). The sup-
port for regular expression search is also added to
DATT to retrieve the inflected forms of the same
connective.
3.3 The user interface
The user interface of DATT is expected to allow
the marking of dependency hierarchies mentioned
in Section 2 in a user-friendly way. the TDB an-
notation requires at least three components, which
are Arg1, Conn and Arg2. In DATT, in order to
guide the annotator, we enforce the labeling of
these mandatory components, while marking of
the supplementary material is optional.
Another feature of DATT is the ability to mark
discontiguous text spans as a unique relation,
which is attested in Turkish discourse (15). Its
connective-argument structure is shown below.
The Arg1 of the connective -erek is interleaved
with the second argument Arg2.
(15) Y?r? lan, dedi Katana, Ramiz?i kolundan
?ekerek, Miskoye korkuyo!
?Hey you, move? said Katana, while drag-
ging Ramiz by the arm, ?Miskoye is freaked
out.?
Conn Arg1 Arg2
-erek Y?r? ... Kat$ 5, Mis$ korkuyo Ram$ ... ?ekerek
4 Conclusion
We adopt a lexical approach to discourse annota-
tion. Connectives are words, and they take two
text spans as arguments. An exploration of these
structures shows that there is argument-sharing
and overlap among relations. We are considering
automatic detection of relation types for an ap-
praisal of discourse relation distribution. For the
time being, DATT has search support for allomor-
phy and regular expressions as an aid to finding
the connectives.
Approximately 60 connective types and 100 to-
kens have been determined so far in the annotation
process, using 3 annotators. 7,000 relation tokens
headed by the connectives have been annotated us-
ing DATT, spanning approximately 300,000-word
text. Work for agreement statistics is under way.
We hope that machine learning techniques can dis-
cover more structure in the data once we have rea-
sonable confidence with annotation.
5We use the notation ?abc$? to refer to the word that be-
gins with the string ?abc?.

Abstract 
Various discourse theories have argued for da-
ta structures ranging from the simplest trees to 
the most complex chain graphs. This paper in-
vestigates the structure represented by the ex-
plicit connectives annotated in the multiple-
genre Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB). The de-
pendencies that violate tree-constraints are an-
alyzed. The effects of information structure in 
the surface form, which result in seemingly 
complex configurations with underlying sim-
ple dependencies, are introduced; and the 
structural implications are discussed. The re-
sults indicate that our current approach to local 
discourse structure needs to accommodate 
properly contained arguments and relations, 
and partially overlapping as well as shared ar-
guments; deviating further from simple trees, 
but not as drastically as a chain graph structure 
would imply, since no genuine cases of struc-
tural crossing dependencies are attested in 
TDB. 
1 Introduction 
A variety of structures for discourse representa-
tion has been proposed, including successive 
trees of varying sizes connected and occasionally 
intertwined at the peripheries (Hobbs, 1985), a 
single tree structure (Rhetorical Structure Theo-
ry, RST, Mann & Thompson, 1988), entity 
chains (Knott et al 2001), tree-adjoining gram-
mars (Discourse-Lexicalized Tree Adjoining 
Grammar, D-LTAG, Webber, 2004), directed 
acyclic graphs (Lee et al, 2006, 2008) and chain 
graphs (Wolf & Gibson, 2005).  
The simplest of these structures is a tree, 
which treats discourse structure simpler than 
sentence-level syntax. The most complex repre-
sentation, chain graphs that allow for crossing 
dependencies and other tree-violations, treats 
discourse as more complex than sentence level. 
We know since the work of Shieber (1985) and 
Joshi (1985) that sentence-level structures re-
quire more than context-free power, but not to 
the extent of dealing with general graphs, or with 
strings that grow out of constant control.  It is of 
general interest to discover whether such com-
plexity occurs in natural discourses, because we 
would like to know how far discourse structures 
deviate from applicative semantics. (Applicative 
structures are binary operations on data; for ex-
ample a connective?s meaning depending only on 
two arguments. A system is applicative if it only 
makes use of function application, but not e.g. 
graph reduction or general function composition. 
The concepts are distinct but related: function 
application can be linked to applicative structures 
by currying.) If more complex structures are 
found, we must go above applicative semantics, 
and we must worry about function compositions 
and graph reductions, which are known to re-
quire more computational power.  
2 Turkish Discourse Bank 
Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is the first large-
scale publicly available language resource with 
discourse level annotations for Turkish built on a 
~ 400,000-word sub-corpus of METU Turkish 
Corpus (MTC) (Say et al, 2002), annotated in 
the style of Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) 
(Prasad et al, 2008). The TDB Relations are 
annotated for explicit discourse connectives, 
which link two spans of text that can be inter-
preted as Abstract Objects (Asher, 1993). Con-
nectives are annotated together with their modi-
fiers and arguments,and with supplementary 
materials for the arguments (Zeyrek & Webber, 
2008; Zeyrek et al, 2010). The first release of 
TDB is available at http://medid.ii.metu.edu.tr/.  
122
  
As in PDTB, the connectives in TDB come 
from a variety of syntactic classes (Zeyrek & 
Webber, ibid). The coordinating and subordinat-
ing conjunctions such as ve ?and? and i?in ?for? 
and ?in order to?, respectively, are considered 
structural connectives, meaning that they take 
both arguments structurally. Discourse adverbials 
and phrasal expressions that are built by combin-
ing a discourse-anaphoric element with a subor-
dinating conjunction are considered to be ana-
phoric connectives, meaning that they only take 
the argument that is syntactically related, and the 
other argument is interpreted anaphorically. In 
PDTB and TDB style, the syntactically related 
argument is called the second argument (Arg2), 
and the other argument is called the first argu-
ment (Arg1), for both structural and anaphoric 
connectives. The syntactic class of the discourse 
connective will be included in the further releas-
es of TDB along with the sense of the discourse 
relations, and some morphological features for 
the arguments of subordinating conjunctions 
(Demir?ahin et al, 2012). 
3 Discourse Relation Configurations in 
Turkish 
Lee et al (2006) identified independent relations 
and fully embedded relations as conforming to 
the tree structure, and shared arguments, proper-
ly contained arguments, pure crossing, and par-
tially overlapping arguments as departures from 
the tree structure in PDTB. Although most depar-
tures from the tree structure can be accounted for 
by non-structural explanations, such as anaphora 
and attribution, Lee et al (2006, 2008) state that 
shared arguments may have to be accepted in 
discourse structure. 
Akta? et al (2010) identified similar structures 
in TDB, adding nested relations that do not vio-
late tree structure constraints, as well as properly 
contained relations that introduce further devia-
tions from trees. Following their terminology, we 
will reserve the word relation to discourse rela-
tions (or coherence relations), and use the term 
configuration to refer to relations between dis-
course relations.  
1.1 Independent, Fully Embedded and 
Nested Relations 
The first release of TDB consists of 8,484 explic-
it relations. The argument spans of some dis-
course connectives do not overlap with those of 
any other connectives in the corpus. We call 
them independent relations. All others are called 
non-independent relations. We have identified 
2,548 non-independent configurations consisting 
of 3,474 unique relations, meaning that 5,010 
relations (59.05%) are independent. Table 1 
shows the distribution of 2,548 non-independent 
configurations.  
 
Configuration # %
Full Embedding 695 27.28
Nested Relations 138 5.42
Total Non-violating  
Configurations 833 32.69
Shared Argument 489 19.19
Prop. Cont. Argument 194 7.61
Prop. Cont. Relation 1018 39.95
Pure Crossing 2 0.08
Partial Overlap 12 0.47
Total Violating  
Configurations 1715 67.31
Total 2548 100.00
 
Table 1: Distribution of non-independent config-
urations 
 
Since full embedding and nested relations con-
form to tree structure, these configurations will 
not be discussed further. The following subsec-
tions discuss the suitability of explanations in-
volving anaphora and attribution to tree-violating 
configurations. Those that cannot be completely 
explained away must be accommodated by the 
discourse structure. 
1.2 Shared Arguments 
Lee et al (2006, 2008) state that shared argu-
ment is one of the configurations that cannot be 
explained away, and should be accommodated by 
discourse structure. Similarly, Egg & Redeker 
(2008) admit that even in a corpus annotated 
within RST Framework, which enforces tree 
structure by annotation guidelines, there is a 
genre-specific structure that is similar to the 
shared arguments in Lee et al (2006). 
 
  
Figure 1 - Shared Argument  
 
123
  
Of the 489 shared arguments in TDB, 331 be-
long to anaphoric discourse relations (i.e. rela-
tions in which at least one of the connectives 
involved is either a discourse adverbial or a 
phrasal expression) (67.69%). In the remaining 
158 relations (32.31%), arguments are shared by 
structural connectives. (1) is an example of a 
shared argument.

browser index of the connectives involved in the 
configuration (2 & 3 in (1)). The first arguments 
(Arg1) of the connectives are in italic, the second 
arguments (Arg2) are in bold. The connectives 
themselves are underlined. For the sake of sim-
plicity, the modifiers of the connectives are dis-
played as part of the connective, and the shared 
tags are omitted when they are immaterial to the 
configuration being discussed. 
In (1), the first argument of but (relation 2) 
annotated in (a) completely overlaps with the 
first argument of because (relation 3), annotated 
in (b) on the same text for comparison. The result 
is a shared argument configuration. 
1.3 Properly Contained Relations and Ar-
guments 
In TDB there are 1,018 properly contained rela-
tions, almost half of which (471 relations; 
46.27%) are caused by anaphoric relations. 
Properly contained relations where anaphoric 
connectives are not involved can be caused by 
attribution, complement clauses, and relative 
clauses. (2) is a relation within a relative clause 
(a), which is part of another relation in the matrix 
clause (b). The result is a properly contained 
relation.

Embedding 
 
Sometimes a verb of attribution is the only el-
ement that causes proper containment. Lee et al 
(2006) argue that since the relation between the 
verb of attribution and the owner of the attribu-
tion is between an abstract object and an entity, 
and not between two abstract objects, it is not a 
124
  
relation on the discourse level. Therefore, those 
stranded verbs of attribution should not be re-
garded as tree-structure violations. In (3) the 
properly contained relations occur in a quote, but 
the intervening materials are more than just verbs 
of attribution. Because the intervening materials 
in (3) are whole sentences that participate in 
complex discourse structures, we believe that (3) 
is different than the case proposed by Lee et al 
(2006) and should be considered a genuine case 
of properly contained relation.

member it vividly, in a stormy night, they sank 
by the west of the Black Sea. He was a captain, 
but he couldn?t swim, my uncle. When he 
washed ashore holding onto a piece of driftwood, 
they pried open his arms with great difficulty, he 
was half frozen. Maybe at that moment he was 
begging God for help, because he was a very 
religious man. But not anymore, now he hits the 
bottle and plays the violin in taverns.? Then he 
sees Nesli?s interested frown and laughs: 
?You?re so gullible!?

?Yes, [...]But not anymore, now he hits the bottle

Nesli?s interested frown and laughs: ?You?re

Whereas attribution can be discarded as a non-
discourse relation, a discourse model based on 
discourse connectives should be able to accom-
modate partially contained relations resulting 
from relations within complements of verbs and 
relative clauses. 
 
  
Figure 3 - Properly Contained Argument 
As in properly contained relations, properly 
contained arguments may arise when an abstract 
object that is external to a quote is in a relation 
with an abstract object in a quote. Likewise, a 
discourse relation within the complement of a 
verb or a relative clause can cause properly con-
tained arguments. Anaphoric connectives ac-
count for the 129 (66.49%) of the 194 properly 
contained arguments in TDB.  
1.4 Partial Overlap 
There are only 12 partial overlaps in TDB, and 
3 of them involve anaphoric relations. 
 
  
Figure 4 - Partial Overlap 
 
In (4), the argument span of in order to par-
tially overlaps with the argument span of to. This 
is a partial overlap of the arguments of two struc-
tural connectives.

?The fact that the governtment took action in 
order to reopen the casinos that were closed 
down in 1998 in order to come up with a solu-
tion to the resource problem caused argu-
ments.? 
 
The first argument of relation 44 (a) properly 
contains the first argument of 45 (b), whereas the 
second argument of (b) properly contains the 
second argument of (a). This double containment 
results in a complicated structure that will be 
analyzed in detail in ?3.5. 
In (5) the second argument of but (relation 42 
(a)) contains only one of the two conjoined 
clauses, whereas the first argument of after (rela-
tion 43 (b)) contains both of them. The most 
probable cause for this difference in annotations 
is the combination of ?blind annotation? with the 
?minimality principle.? This principle guides the 
participants to annotate the minimum text span 
required to interpret the relation. Since the anno-
tators cannot see previous annotations, they have 
to assess the minimum span of an argument 
again when they annotate the second relation. 
Sometimes the minimal span for one relation is 
annotated differently than the minimal span re-
quired for the other, resulting in partial overlaps.

1.5 Pure Crossing 
There are only 2 pure crossing examples in the 
current release of TDB, a number so small that it 
is tempting to treat them as negligible. However, 
the inclusion of pure crossing would result in the 
most dramatic change in discourse structure, 
raising the complexity level to chain graph and 
making discourse structure markedly more com-
plex than sentence level grammar. Therefore, we 
would like to discuss both examples in detail.

Someone has an errand to run, they walk hur-
riedly or run. Then the girl stiffens suddenly. 
The boy stiffens, too; and every run has a hid-
den wish.?
 
In (6), the discourse relation encoded by then 
is not only anaphoric -and therefore not determi-
nant in terms of discourse structure- but also the 
crossing annotation does not necessarily arise 
from the coherence relation of the connective?s 
arguments. It is more likely imposed by lexical 
cohesive elements (Halliday & Hasan, 1976), as 
the annotators apparently made use of the repeti-
tions of ans?z?n ?suddenly? and ko? ?run? in the 
text when they could not interpret the intended 
meaning. 
 
  
Figure 5 - Pure Crossing 
 
The other example, given in (7), is not ana-
phoric. It is more interesting as it points to a pe-
culiar structure similar to (4) in ?3.4, a surface 
crossing which is frequent in the subordinating 
conjunctions of Turkish.

?The penalty was given because Telekom abused 
its monopoly status in the two different internet

A closer inspection reveals that the pure cross-
ings in (7) are caused by two distinct reasons.  
The first reason is the repetition of the subor-
dinator i?in ?because?. Had there been only the 
rightmost subordinator, the relation would be a 
simple case of Full Embedding, where ve ?and? 
in (b) connects the two reasons for the penalty, 
while the rightmost subordinator connects the 
combined reasons to the matrix clause (see Fig-
ure 6). However, since both subordinators were 
present, they were annotated separately. They 
share their first arguments, and take different 
spans as their second arguments, which are also 
connected by ve ?and?, resulting in an apparent 
pure crossing.  
Our alternative analysis is that ve ?and? actual-
ly takes the subordinators i?in ?because? in its 
scope, and it should be analyzed similar to an 
assumed single-subordinator case. This kind of 
annotation was not available in TDB because the 
annotation guidelines state that the discourse 
connectives at the peripheries of the arguments 
should be left out. Machine Learning can help us 
spot these instances. 
The second reason for crossing is the wrap-
ping of the first arguments of (a) and (c) around 
the subordinate clause. This crossing is in fact 
not a configuration-level dependency, but a rela-
tion-level surface phenomenon confined within 
the relation anchored by i?in ?because?, without 
underlying complex discourse semantics. Exam-
ple (8) is a simpler case where the surface cross-
ing within the relation can be observed.

b. Single-subordinator (hypothetical)

Commodity Exchange Market but cannot ob-

Subordinators in Turkish form adverbial 
clauses (Kornfilt, 1997), so they can occupy any 
position that is legitimate for a sentential adverb. 
Wrapping in discourse seems to be motivated 
information-structurally. In the unmarked posi-
tion, the subordinate clause comes before the 
matrix clause and introduces a theme. However, 
the discourse constituents can occupy different 
positions or carry non-neutral prosodic features 
to express different information structures 
(Demir?ahin, 2008). In (7), wrapping takes ceza 
?penalty? away from the rheme and makes it part 
of the theme, at the same time bringing the caus-
al discourse relation into the rheme. 
As is clear from the gloss in (7) and its 
stringset, this is function application, where ceza 
verildi ?penalty was given? wraps in the first 
argument as a whole. Double occurrence of the 
?connective? within the wrapped-in argument is 
causing the apparent crossing, but there is in fact 
one discourse relation. 
  
Figure 7 - Wrapping 
 
Wrapping in discourse is almost exclusive to 
subordinating conjunctions, possibly due to their 
adverbial freedom in sentence-level syntax. The 
subordinators make up 468 of the total of 479 
wrapping cases identified in TDB. However, 
there are also four cases of coordinating conjunc-
tions with wrapping. Two of them result in sur-
face crossing as in (9), and the other two build a 
nested-like structure, as in (10) and (11). The 
latter two are both parentheticals.

In (9) ve ?and? links two relative clauses, one

should be noted that the first part of Arg1 
(Bezirci-nin) has an ambiguous suffix. The suffix 
could be the agreement marker of the relative 
clause, as reflected in the annotation, or it could 
be the genitive marked complement of the geni-
tive-possessive construction Bezirci?nin antoloji 
haz?rl??? ?Bezirci?s anthology preparation?. The 
latter analysis does not cause wrapping.

justed their lives according to this cannon shot.? 
 
Both (10) and (11) are parentheticals, resulting 
in a double-wrapping-like construction (Figure 
8). However, parentheticals move freely in the 
clause and occupy various positions, so we be-
lieve that this construction should be taken as a 
peculiarity of the parenthetical, rather than the 
structural connectives involved in the relation.

4 Conclusion 
In this paper we presented possible deviations 
from the tree structure in the first release of 
TDB. Following Lee et al (2006, 2008) and 
Akta? et al (2010). We have scanned the corpus 
for shared arguments, properly contained rela-
tions and arguments, partial overlaps, and pure 
crossings. Overall, about half of these configura-
tions can be accounted for by anaphoric rela-
tions, i.e. they are not applicative structures (see 
Table 2). Note that if one of the relations in a 
configuration is anaphoric, we treat the configu-
ration as anaphoric.

Table 2: Distribution of anaphoric relations 
among tree-violating configurations 
 
In addition to the shared arguments that were 
accepted in discourse structure by Lee et al, we 
have also come up with partially contained rela-
tions arising from verbal complements and rela-
tive clauses. These structures can be treated dif-
ferently in other frameworks; for instance in 
RST, they are treated as discourse constituents 
taking part in coherence relations. However, for 
the connective-based approach adopted in this 
study, they need to be accommodated as devia-
tions from tree structure.  
The few partial overlaps we have encountered 
could mostly be explained away by wrapping and 
by different interpretations of annotation guide-
lines by the annotators, especially the minimality 
principle. Recall that wrap has applicative se-
mantics. Of the two pure crossing examples we 
have found, one was also anaphoric, whereas the 
other could be explained in terms of information-
structurally motivated relation-level surface 
crossing, rather than configuration-level crossing 
dependency. In other words, if we leave the pro-
cessing of information structure to other process-
es, the need for more elaborate annotation disap-
pears. In Joshi?s (2011) terminology, immediate 
discourse in the TDB appears to be an applica-
tive structure, which, unlike syntax, seems to be 
in no need of currying.  
As a result, we can state that pure crossing (i.e. 
crossing of the arguments of structural connec-
tives) is not genuinely attested in the current 
release of TDB. The annotation scheme need not 
be enriched to allow more complex algorithms to 
deal with unlimited use of crossing. There seems 
to be a reason in every contested case to go back 
to the annotation, and revise it in ways to keep 
the applicative semantics, without losing much of 
the connective?s meaning.  
  In summary, our preliminary analysis shows 
that discourse structure may have to accommo-
date partial containment and wrap in addition to 
shared arguments. TDB has an applicative struc-
ture.   
  Taking into account that independent relations, 
fully embedded relations and nested relations are 
frequent in discourse structure, and that the dis-
course structure should accommodate shared 
arguments and partial containments; we are cur-
rently inclined to think of discourse structure as 
Hobbs (1985) does: local trees of various sizes 
connected and occasionally intertwined at the 
edges. Further complications within trees are an 
open field for further studies.
