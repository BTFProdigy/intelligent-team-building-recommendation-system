Abstract
Wiktionary, a satellite of the Wikipedia
initiative, can be seen as a potential re-
source for Natural Language Processing.
It requires however to be processed be-
fore being used efficiently as an NLP re-
source. After describing the relevant as-
pects of Wiktionary for our purposes, we
focus on its structural properties. Then,
we describe how we extracted synonymy
networks from this resource. We pro-
vide an in-depth study of these synonymy
networks and compare them to those ex-
tracted from traditional resources. Fi-
nally, we describe two methods for semi-
automatically improving this network by
adding missing relations: (i) using a kind
of semantic proximity measure; (ii) using
translation relations of Wiktionary itself.
Note: The experiments of this paper are based on Wik-
tionary?s dumps downloaded in year 2008. Differences may
be observed with the current versions available online.
1 Introduction
Reliable and comprehensive lexical resources con-
stitute a crucial prerequisite for various NLP tasks.
However their building cost keeps them rare. In
this context, the success of the Princeton Word-
Net (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) can be explained by
the quality of the resource but also by the lack of
serious competitors. Widening this observation to
more languages only makes this observation more
acute. In spite of various initiatives, costs make
resource development extremely slow or/and re-
sult in non freely accessible resources. Collabo-
rative resources might bring an attractive solution
to this difficult situation. Among them Wiktionary
seems to be the perfect resource for building com-
putational mono-lingual and multi-lingual lexica.
This paper focuses therefore on Wiktionary, how
to improve it, and on its exploitation for creating
resources.
In next section, we present some relevant infor-
mation about Wiktionary. Section 3 presents the
lexical graphs we are using and the way we build
them. Then we pay some attention to evaluation
(?4) before exploring some tracks of improvement
suggested by Wiktionary structure itself.
2 Wiktionary
As previously said, NLP suffers from a lack of
lexical resources, be it due to the low-quality or
non-existence of such resources, or to copyrights-
related problems. As an example, we consider
French language resources. Jacquin et al (2002)
highlighted the limitations and inconsistencies
from the French EuroWordnet. Later, Sagot and
Fi?er (2008) explained how they needed to re-
course to PWN, BalkaNet (Tufis, 2000) and other
resources (notably Wikipedia) to build WOLF, a
free French WordNet that is promising but still a
very preliminary resource. Some languages are
straight-off purely under-resourced.
The Web as Corpus initiative arose (Kilgarriff
and Grefenstette, 2003) as an attempt to design
tools and methodologies to use the web for over-
coming data sparseness (Keller and Lapata, 2002).
Nevertheless, this initiative raised non-trivial tech-
nical problems described in Baroni et al (2008).
Moreover, the web is not structured enough to eas-
ily and massively extract semantic relations.
In this context, Wiktionary could appear to be
a paradisiac playground for creating various lexi-
19
cal resources. We describe below the Wiktionary
resource and we explain the restrictions and prob-
lems we are facing when trying to exploit it. This
description may complete few earlier ones, for ex-
ample Zesch et al (2008a).
2.1 Collaborative editing
Wiktionary, the lexical companion to Wikipedia,
is a collaborative project to produce a free-content
multilingual dictionary.
1
As the other Wikipedia?s
satellite projects, the resource is not experts-led,
rather filled by any kind of users. The might-be
inaccuracy of the resulting resource has lengthily
been discussed and we will not debate it: see Giles
(2005) and Britannica (2006) for an illustration
of the controversy. Nevertheless, we think that
Wiktionary should be less subject (so far) than
Wikipedia to voluntary misleading content (be it
for ideological, commercial reasons, or alike).
2.2 Articles content
As one may expect, a Wiktionary article
2
may (not
systematically) give information on a word?s part
of speech, etymology, definitions, examples, pro-
nunciation, translations, synonyms/antonyms, hy-
pernyms/hyponyms, etc.
2.2.1 Multilingual aspects
Wiktionary?s multilingual organisation may be
surprising and not always meet one?s expectations
or intuitions. Wiktionaries exist in 172 languages,
but we can read on the English language main
page, ?1,248,097 entries with English definitions
from over 295 languages?. Indeed, a given wik-
tionary describes the words in its own language
but also foreign words. For example, the English
article moral includes the word in English (adjec-
tive and noun) and Spanish (adjective and noun)
but not in French. Another example, boucher,
which does not exist in English, is an article of the
English wiktionary, dedicated to the French noun
(a butcher) and French verb (to cork up).
A given wiktionary?s ?in other languages? left
menu?s links, point to articles in other wiktionar-
ies describing the word in the current language.
For example, the Fran?ais link in the dictionary
article of the English wiktionary points to an arti-
cle in the French one, describing the English word
dictionary.
1
http://en.wiktionary.org/
2
What article refers to is more fuzzy than classical entry
or acceptance means.
2.2.2 Layouts
In the following paragraph, we outline wik-
tionary?s general structure. We only consider
words in the wiktionary?s own language.
An entry consists of a graphical form and a cor-
responding article that is divided into the follow-
ing, possibly embedded, sections:
? etymology sections separate homonyms when
relevant;
? among an etymology section, different parts
of speech may occur;
? definitions and examples belong to a part of
speech section and may be subdivided into sub-
senses;
? translations, synonyms/antonyms and hy-
pernyms/hyponyms are linked to a given part of
speech, with or without subsenses distinctions.
In figure 1 is depicted an article?s layout example.
Figure 1: Layout of boot article (shortened)
About subsenses, they are identified with an in-
dex when first introduced but they may appear as
a plain text semantic feature (without index) when
used in relations (translations, synonyms, etc.). It
is therefore impossible to associate the relations
arguments to subsenses. Secondly, subsense index
appears only in the current word (the source of the
relation) and not in the target word?s article it is
linked to (see orange French N. and Adj., Jan. 10,
2008
3
).
A more serious issue appears when relations are
shared by several parts of speech sections. In Ital-
3
http://fr.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?
title=orange&oldid=2981313
20
ian, both synonyms and translations parts are com-
mon to all words categories (see for example car-
dinale N. and Adj., Apr. 26, 2009
4
).
2.3 Technical issues
As Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia Founda-
tion?s projects, the Wiktionary?s content manage-
ment system relies on the MediaWiki software
and on the wikitext. As stated in Wikipedia?s
MetaWiki article, ?no formal syntax has been de-
fined? for the MediaWiki and consequently it is
not possible to write a 100% reliable parser.
Unlike Wikipedia, no HTML dump is available
and one has to parse the Wikicode. Wikicode
is difficult to handle since wiki templates require
handwritten rules that need to be regularly up-
dated. Another difficulty is the language-specific
encoding of the information. Just to mention one,
the target language of a translation link is iden-
tified by a 2 or 3 letters ISO-639 code for most
languages. However in the Polish wiktionary the
complete name of the language name (angielski,
francuski, . . . ) is used.
2.4 Parsing and modeling
The (non-exhaustive) aforementioned list of diffi-
culties (see ?2.2.2 and ?2.3) leads to the following
consequences:
? Writing a parser for a given wiktionary is
possible only after an in-depth observation of its
source. Even an intensive work will not prevent
all errors as long as (i) no syntax-checking is made
when editing an article and (ii) flexibility with the
?tacitly agreed? layout conventions is preserved.
Better, flexibility is presented as a characteristic of
the framework:
?[. . . ] it is not a set of rigid rules. You may
experiment with deviations, but other editors
may find those deviations unacceptable, and
revert those changes. They have just as much
right to do that as you have to make them.
5
?
Moreover, a parser has to be updated every new
dump, as templates, layout conventions (and so
on) may change.
?Writing parsers for different languages is not a
simple adjustment, rather a complete overhaul.
? When extracting a network of semantic rela-
tions from a given wiktionary, some choices are
more driven by the wiktionary inner format than
scientific modelling choices. An illustration fol-

lows in ?3.2. When merging information extracted
from several languages, the homogenisation of the
data structure often leads to the choice of the poor-
est one, resulting in a loss of information.
2.5 The bigger the better?
Taking advantage of colleagues mastering various
languages, we studied the wiktionary of the fol-
lowing languages: French, English, German, Pol-
ish and Mandarin Chinese. A first remark con-
cerns the size of the resource. The official num-
ber of declared articles in a given wiktionary in-
cludes a great number of meta-articles which are
not word entries As of April 2009, the French wik-
tionary reaches the first rank
6
, before the English
one. This can be explained by the automated im-
port of public-domain dictionaries articles (Littr?
1863 and Dictionnaire de l?Acad?mie Fran?aise
1932-1935). Table 1 shows the ratio between the
total number of articles and the ?relevant? ones
(numbers based on year 2008 snapshots).

Table 1: Ratio of ?relevant? articles in wiktionaries
By ?relevant?, we mean an article about a word
in the wiktionary?s own language (e.g. not an
article about a French word in the English Wik-
tionary). Among the ?relevant? articles, some
are empty and some do not contain any transla-
tion nor synonym link. Therefore, before deciding
to use Wiktionary, it is necessary to compare the
amount of extracted information contribution and
the amount of work required to obtain it .
3 Study of synonymy networks
In this section, we study synonymy networks built
from different resources. First, we introduce
some general properties of lexical networks (?3.1).
Then we explain how we build Wiktionary?s syn-
onymy network and how we analyse its proper-
ties. In ?3.3, we show how we build similar graphs
from traditional resources for evaluation purposes.
3.1 Structure of lexical networks
In the following sections, a graph G = (V,E)
is defined by a set V of n vertices and a set
E ? V
2
of m edges. In this paper, V is
6
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_
of_Wiktionaries
21
a set of words and E is defined by a relation
E
R
7?? E : (w
1
, w
2
) ? E if and only if w
1
R
? w
2
.
Most of lexical networks, as networks extracted
from real world, are small worlds (SW) net-
works. Comparing structural characteristics of
wiktionary-based lexical networks to some stan-
dard resource should be done according to well-
known properties of SW networks (Watts and
Strogatz, 1998; Barabasi et al, 2000; Newman,
2003; Gaume et al, 2008). These properties are:
? Edge sparsity: SW are sparse in edges
m = O(n) or m = O(n log(n))
? Short paths: in SW, the average path length
(L)
7
is short. Generally there is at least one short
path between any two nodes.
? High clustering: in SW, the clustering coef-
ficient (C) that expresses the probability that two
distinct nodes adjacent to a given third one are ad-
jacent, is an order of magnitude higher than for
Erdos-Renyi (random) graphs: C
SW
 C
random
;
this indicates that the graph is locally dense, al-
though it is globally sparse.
?Heavy-tailed degree distribution: the distri-
bution of the vertices incidence degrees follows a
power law in a SW graph. The probability P (k)
that a given node has k neighbours decreases as a
power law, P (k) ? k
a
(a being a constant charac-
teristic of the graph). Random graphs conforms to
a Poisson Law.
3.2 Wiktionary?s network
Graph extraction Considering what said in
?2.2.2 and ?2.4, we made the following choices:
8
? Vertices: a vertex is built for each entry?s part
of speech.
? Parts of speech: when modeling the links
from X (X having for part of speech Pos
X
) to
one of its synonyms Y , we assume that Pos
Y
=
Pos
X
, thus building vertex Pos
Y
.Y.
? Subsenses: subsenses are flattened. First, the
subsenses are not always mentioned in the syn-
onyms section. Second, if we take into account
the subsenses, they only appear in the source of the
relation. For example, considering in figure 1 the
relation boot
syn
??? kick (both nouns), and given the
10 subsenses for boot and the 5 ones for kick, we
should build 15 vertices. And we should then add
7
Average length of the shortest path between any two
nodes.
8
These choices can clearly be discussed from a linguis-
tic point of view and judged to be biased. Nevertheless, we
adopted them as a first approximation to make the modelling
possible.
all the links between the mentioned boot?s sub-
senses and the 5 kick?s existing subsenses. This
would lead to a high number of edges, but the
graph would not be closer to the reality. The way
subsenses appear in Wiktionary are unpredictable.
"Subsenses" correspond sometimes to homonyms
or clear-cut senses of polysemous words, but can
also correspond to facets, word usage or regu-
lar polysemy. Moreover, some entries have no
subsenses distinction whereas it would be wor-
thy. More globally, the relevance of discrete word
senses has been seriously questioned, see (Victorri
and Fuchs, 1996) or (Kilgarriff, 1997) for very
convincing discussions. Two more practical rea-
sons led us to this choice. We want our method to
be reproducible for other languages and some wik-
tionaries do not include subsenses. At last, some
gold standard resources (eg. Dicosyn) have their
subsenses flattened too and we want to compare
the resources against each other.
? Edges: wiktionary?s synonymy links are ori-
ented but we made the graph symmetric. For ex-
ample, boot does not appear in kick?s synonyms.
Some words even appear as synonyms without be-
ing an entry of Wiktionary.
From the boot example (figure 1), we extract ver-
tices {N.boot, V.boot}, build {N.buskin,
N.kick, V.kick} and we add the follow-
ing (symmetrized) edges: N.boot?N.buskin,
N.boot?N.kick and V.boot?V.kick.
Graph properties By observing the table 2, we
can see that the graphs of synonyms extracted
from Wiktionary are all typical small worlds. In-
deed their l
lcc
remains short, their C
lcc
is always
greater or equal than 0.2 and their distribution
curves of the vertices incidence degree is very
close to a power law (a least-square method gives
always exponent a
lcc
? ?2.35 with a confidence
r
2
lcc
always greater than 0.89). It can also be seen
that the average incidence k
lcc
ranges from 2.32
to 3.32.
9
It means that no matter which language
9
It is noteworthy that the mean incidence of vertices is al-
most always the same (close to 2.8) no matter the graph size
is. If we assume that all wiktionary?s graphs grow in a similar
way but at different speed rates (after all it is the same frame-
work), graphs (at least their statistical properties) from differ-
ent languages can be seen as snapshots of the same graph at
different times. This would mean that the number of graphs
edges tends to grow proportionally with the number of ver-
tices. This fits with the dynamic properties of small worlds
(Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005). It means that for a wik-
tionary system, even with many contributions, graph density
is likely to remain constant and we will see that in compar-
ison to traditional lexical resources this density is quite low.

3.3 Building synonymy networks from
known standards
WordNet There are many possible ways for
building lexical networks from PWN. We tried
several methods but only two of them are worth
to be mentioned here. The graphs we built have
words as vertices, not synsets or senses. A first
straightforward method (method A) consists in
adding an edge between two vertices only if the
corresponding words appear as elements of the
same synset. This method produced many discon-
nected graphs of various sizes. Both the compu-
tational method we planned to use and our intu-
itions about such graphs were pointing towards a
bigger graph that would cover most of the lexical
network.
We therefore decided to exploit the hypernymy
relation. Traditional dictionaries indeed propose
hypernyms when one look for synonyms of very
specific terms, making hypernymy the closest re-
lation to synonymy at least from a lexicographic
viewpoint. However, adding all the hypernymy re-
lations resulted in a network extremely dense in
edges with some vertices having a high number of
neighbours. This was due to the tree-like organi-
sation of WordNet that gives a very special impor-
tance to higher nodes of the tree.
In the end we retained method B that consists in
adding edges in following cases:
? if two words belong to the same synset;
? if a word only appears in a synset that is a leaf
of the tree and contains only this word, then cre-
ate edges linking to words included in the hyper-
nym(s) synset.
We would like to study the evolution through time of wik-
tionaries, however this is outside the scope of this paper.
Therefore when a vertice w do not get any neigh-
bour according to method A, method B adds edges
linking w to words included in the hypernym(s)
synset of the synset {w}. We only added hyper-
nyms for the leaves of the tree in order to keep our
relations close to the synonymy idea. This idea has
already been exploited for some WordNet-based
semantic distances calculation taking into account
the depth of the relation in the tree (Leacock and
Chodorow, 1998).
Dicosyn graphs Dicosyn is a compilation of
synonym relations extracted from seven dictionar-
ies (Bailly, Benac, Du Chazaud, Guizot, Lafaye,
Larousse and Robert):
10
there is an edge r ? s if
and only if r and s have the same syntactic cate-
gory and at least one dictionary proposes s being
a synonym in the dictionary entry r. Then, each
of the three graphs (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives) ob-
tained is made symmetric (dicosyn-fr-N, dicosyn-
fr-V and dicosyn-fr-A).
Properties of the graphs extracted Table 3
sums-up the structural properties of the synonyms
networks built from standard resources.
We can see that all the synonymy graphs ex-
tracted from PWN or Dicosyn are SW graphs.
Indeed their l
lcc
remains short, their C
lcc
is al-
ways greater or equal than 0.35 and their distri-
bution curves of the vertices incidence degree is
very close to a power law (a least-square method
gives always exponent a
lcc
near of ?2.30 with a
confidence r
2
lcc
always greater than 0.85). It can
also be observed that no matter the part of speech,
the average incidence of Dicosyn-based graphs is
always lower than WordNet ones.
10
Dicosyn has been first produced at ATILF, before being
corrected at CRISCO laboratory.

Table 3: Gold standard?s synonymy graphs properties
4 Wiktionary graphs evaluation
Coverage and global SW analysis By compar-
ing tables 2 and 3, one can observe that:
? The lexical coverage of Wiktionary-based syn-
onyms graphs is always quantitatively lower than
those of standard resources although this may
change. For example, to horn (in PWN), absent
from Wiktionary in 2008, appeared in 2009. At
last, Wiktionary is more inclined to include some
class of words such as to poo (childish) or to
prefetch, to google (technical neologisms).
? The average number of synonyms for an en-
try of a Wiktionary-based resource is smaller than
those of standard resources. For example, com-
mon synonyms such as to act/to play appear in
PWN and not in Wiktionary. Nevertheless, some
other appear (rightly) in Wiktionary: to reduce/to
decrease, to cook/to microwave.
? The clustering rate of Wiktionary-based
graphs is always smaller than those of standard re-
sources. This is particularly the case for English.
However, this specificity might be due to differ-
ences between the resources themselves (Dicosyn
vs. PWN) rather than structural differences at the
linguistic level.
Evaluation of synonymy In order to evaluate
the quality of extracted synonymy graphs from
Wiktionary, we use recall and precision measure.
The objects we compare are not simple sets but
graphs (G = (V ;E)), thus we should compare
separately set of vertices (V ) and set of edges (E).
Vertices are words and edges are synonymy links.
Vertices evaluation leads to measure the resource
(a) English Wiktionary vs. Wordnet
Precision Recall
Nouns 14120/22075 = 0.64 14120/117798 = 0.12
Adj. 5874/8437 = 0.70 5874/21479 = 0.27
Verbs 5157/6368 = 0.81 5157/11529 = 0.45
(b) French Wiktionary vs. Dicosyn
Precision Recall
Nouns 10393/18017 = 0.58 10393/29372 = 0.35
Adj. 3076/5411 = 0.57 3076/9452 = 0.33
Verbs 2966/3897 = 0.76 2966/9147 = 0.32
Table 4: Wiktionary coverage
coverage whereas edges evaluation leads to mea-
sure the quality of the synonymy links in Wik-
tionary resource.
First of all, the global picture (table 4) shows
clearly that the lexical coverage is rather poor. A
lot of words included in standard resources are not
included yet in the corresponding wiktionary re-
sources. Overall the lexical coverage is always
lower than 50%. This has to be kept in mind while
looking at the evaluation of relations shown in ta-
ble 5. To compute the relations evaluation, each
resource has been first restricted to the links be-
tween words being present in each resource.
About PWN, since every link added with
method A will also be added with method B, the
precision of Wiktionary-based graphs synonyms
links will be always lower for "method A graphs"
than for "method B graphs". Precision is rather
good while recall is very low. That means that a
lot of synonymy links of the standard resources
are missing within Wiktionary. As for Dicosyn,
the picture is similar with even better precision but
very low recall.
5 Exploiting Wiktionary for improving
Wiktionary
As seen in section 4, Wiktionary-based resources
are very incomplete with regard to synonymy. We
propose two tasks for adding some of these links:
Task 1: Adding synonyms to Wiktionary by
taking into account its Small World characteristics
for proposing new synonyms.
(a) English wiktionary vs. Wordnet
Precision Recall
Nouns (A) 2503/6453 = 0.39 2503/11021 = 0.23
Nouns (B) 2763/6453 = 0.43 2763/18440 = 0.15
Adj. (A) 786/3139 = 0.25 786/5712 = 0.14
Adj. (B) 1314/3139 = 0.42 1314/12792 = 0.10
Verbs (A) 866/2667 = 0.32 866/10332 = 0.08
Verbs (B) 993/2667 = 0.37 993/18725 = 0.05
(b) French wiktionary vs. Dicosyn
Precision Recall
Nouns 3510/5075 = 0.69 3510/44501 = 0.08
Adj. 1300/1677 = 0.78 1300/17404 = 0.07
Verbs 899/1267 = 0.71 899/23968 = 0.04
Table 5: Wiktionary synonymy links precision & recall
24
Task 2: Adding synonyms to Wiktionary by
taking into account the translation relations.
We evaluate these two tasks against the bench-
marks presented in section 3.2.
5.1 Improving synonymy in Wiktionary by
exploiting its small world structure
We propose here to enrich synonymy links of Wik-
tionary by taking into account that lexical net-
works have a high clustering coefficient. Our hy-
pothesis is that missing links in Wiktionary should
be within clusters.
A high clustering coefficient means that two
words which are connected to a third one are likely
to be connected together. In other words neigh-
bours of my neighbours should also be in my
neighbourhood. We propose to reverse this prop-
erty to the following hypothesis: "neighbour of my
neighbours which are not in my neighbourhood
should be a good neighbour candidate". Thus the
first method we test consist simply in connecting
every vertex to neighbours of its neighbours. One
can repeat this operation until the expected num-
ber of edges is obtained.
11
Secondly we used the PROX approach pro-
posed by (Gaume et al, 2009). It is a stochastic
method designed for studying ?Hierarchical Small
Worlds?. Briefly put, for a given vertex u, one
computes for all other vertices v the probability
that a randomly wandering particle starting from
u stands in v after a fixed number of steps. Let
P (u, v) be this value. We propose to connect u
to the k first vertices ranked in descending order
with respect of P (u, v). We always choose k pro-
portionally to the original degree of u (number of
neighbours of u).
For a small number of steps (3 in our case) ran-
dom wanderings tend to be trapped into local clus-
ter structures. So a vertex v with a high P (u, v) is
likely to belong to the same cluster as u, which
means that a link u?v might be relevant.
Figure 2 shows precision, recall and f-score
evolution for French verbs graph when edges are
added using ?neighourhood? method (neigh), and
using ?Prox? method. Dashed line correspond to
the value theoretically obtained by choosing edges
at random. First, both methods are clearly more
efficient than a random addition, which is not sur-
prising but it seems to confirm our hypothesis that
missing edges are within clusters. Adding sharply
11
We repeat it only two times, otherwise the number of
added edges is too large.

Figure 2: Precision, recall and F-score of French verbs
graph enlarged using only existing synonymy links
neighbours of neighbours seems to be as good as
adding edges ranked by Prox, anyway the rank
provided by Prox permits to add a given number
of edges. This ranking can also be useful to order
potential links if one think about a user validation
system. Synonyms added by Prox and absent from
gold standards are not necessarily false.
For example Prox proposes a relevant link ab-
solve/forgive, not included in PWN. Moreover,
many false positive are still interesting to consider
for improving the resource. For example, Prox
adds relations such as hypernyms (to uncover/to
peel) or inter-domain ?synonyms? (to skin/to peel).
This is due to high clustering (see ?3.1) and to
the fact that clusters in synonymy networks corre-
lates with language concepts (Gaume et al, 2008;
Duvignau and Gaume, 2008; Gaume et al, 2009;
Fellbaum, 1999).
Finally note that results are similar for other
parts of speech and other languages.
5.2 Using Wiktionary?s translation links to
improve its synonymy network
Assuming that two words sharing many transla-
tions in different languages are likely to be syn-
onymous, we propose to use Wiktionary?s transla-
tion links to enhance the synonymy network of a
given language.
In order to rank links to be potentially added,
we use a simple Jaccard measure: let T
w
be the set
of a word w?s translations, then for every couple
of words (w,w
?
) we have:
Jaccard(w,w
?
) =
|T
w
? T
w
?
|
|T
w
? T
w
?
|
We compute this measure for every possible pair
of words and then, starting from Wiktionary?s syn-
onymy graph, we incrementally add links accord-
ing to their Jaccard rank.
25
We notice first that most of synonymy links
added by this method were not initially included
in Wiktionary?s synonymy network. For exam-
ple, regarding English verbs, 95% of 2000 best
ranked proposed links are new. Hence this method
may be efficient to improve graph density. How-
ever one can wonder about the quality of the new
added links, so we discuss precision in the next
paragraph.
In figure 3 is depicted the evolution of precision,
recall and F-score for French verbs in the enlarged
graph in regard of the total number of edges. We
use Dicosyn graph as a gold standard. The dashed
line corresponds to theoretical scores one can ex-
pect by adding randomly chosen links.
First we notice that both precision and recall
are significantly higher than we can expect from
random addition. This confirms that words shar-
ing the same translations are good synonym candi-
dates. Added links seem to be particularly relevant
at the beginning for higher Jaccard scores. From
the first dot to the second one we add about 1000
edges (whereas the original graph contains 1792
edges) and the precision only decreases from 0.71
to 0.69.
The methods we proposed in this section are
quite simple and there is room for improvement.
First, both methods can be combined in order
to improve the resource using translation links
and then using clusters structure. One can also
think to the corollary task that would consists in
adding translation links between two languages
using synonymy links of others languages.

6 Conclusion and future work
This paper gave us the opportunity to share some
Wiktionary experience related lexical resources
building. We presented in addition two approaches
for improving these resources and their evaluation.
The first approach relies on the small world struc-
ture of synonymy networks. We postulated that
many missing links in Wiktionary should be added
among members of the same cluster. The second
approach assumes that two words sharing many
translations in different languages are likely to be
synonymous. The comparison with traditional re-
sources shows that our hypotheses are confirmed.
We now plan to combine both approaches.
The work presented in this paper combines a
NLP contribution involving data extraction and
rough processing of the data and a mathematical
contribution concerning graph-like resource. In
our viewpoint the second aspect of our work is
therefore complementary of other NLP contribu-
tions, like (Zesch et al, 2008b), involving more
sophisticated NLP processing of the resource.
Support for collaborative editing Our results
should be useful for setting up a more efficient
framework for Wiktionary collaborative editing.
We should be able to always propose a set of syn-
onymy relations that are likely to be. For exam-
ple, when a contributor creates or edits an arti-
cle, he may think about adding very few links but
might not bother providing an exhaustive list of
synonyms. Our tool can propose a list of potential
synonyms, ordered by relevancy. Each item of this
list would only need to be validated (or not).
Diachronic study An interesting topic for future
work is a "diachronic" study of the resource. It
is possible to access Wiktionary at several stages,
this can be used for studying how such resources
evolve. Grounded on this kind of study, one may
predict the evolution of newer wiktionaries and
foresee contributors? NLP needs. We would like
to set up a framework for everyone to test out new
methodologies for enriching and using Wiktionary
resources. Such observatory, would allow to fol-
low not only the evolution of Wiktionary but also
of Wiktionary-grounded resources, that will only
improve thanks to steady collaborative develop-
ment.
Invariants and variabality Wiktionary as a
massively mutiligual synonymy networks is an
extremely promising resource for studying the
(in)variability of semantic pairings such as
house/family, child/fruit, feel/know... (Sweetser,
1991; Gaume et al, 2009). A systematic study
within the semantic approximation framework
presented in the paper on Wiktionary data will be
carried on in the future.

Acquisition and enrichment of morphological and morphosemantic
knowledge from the French Wiktionary
Nabil Hathout Franck Sajous Basilio Calderone
CLLE-ERSS (CNRS & Universit?e de Toulouse 2)
Abstract
We present two approaches to automatically acquire morphologically related words from Wik-
tionary. Starting with related words explicitly mentioned in the dictionary, we propose a method
based on orthographic similarity to detect new derived words from the entries? definitions with
an overall accuracy of 93.5%. Using word pairs from the initial lexicon as patterns of formal
analogies to filter new derived words enables us to rise the accuracy up to 99%, while extending
the lexicon?s size by 56%. In a last experiment, we show that it is possible to semantically type
the morphological definitions, focusing on the detection of process nominals.
1 Introduction
Around the 1980s the computational exploitation of machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) for the au-
tomatic acquisition of lexical and semantic information enjoyed a great favor in NLP (Calzolari et al.,
1973; Chodorow et al., 1985). MRDs? definitions provided robust and structured knowledge from which
semantic relations were automatically extracted for linguistic studies (Markowitz et al., 1986) and lin-
guistic resources development (Calzolari, 1988). Today the scenario has changed as corpora have become
the main source for semantic knowledge acquisition. However, dictionaries are regaining some interest
thanks to the availability of public domain dictionaries, especially Wiktionary.
In the present work, we describe a method to create a morphosemantic and morphological French
lexicon from Wiktionary?s definitions. This type of large coverage resource is not available for almost
all languages, with the exception of the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) for English, German and
Dutch, a paid resource distributed by the LDC.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reports related work on semantic and morphological
acquisition from MRDs. In Section 3, we describe how we converted Wiktionnaire, the French language
edition of Wiktionary, into a structured XML-tagged MRD which contains, among other things, defini-
tions and morphological relations. In Section 4, we explain how we used Wiktionnaire?s morphological
sections to create a lexicon of morphologically related words. The notion of morphological definitions
and their automatic identification are introduced in Section 5. In Section 6, we show how these defini-
tions enable us to acquire new derived words and enrich the initial lexicon. Finally, Section 7 describes
an experiment where we semantically typed process nouns definitions.
2 Related work
Semantic relations are usually acquired using corpora (Curran and Moens, 2002; van der Plas and Bouma,
2005; Heylen et al., 2008) but may also be acquired from MRDs. MRDs-based approaches are bound
to the availability of such resources. However, for some languages including French, no such resource
exists. Recent years have seen the development of large resources built automatically by aggregating
and/or translating data originating from different sources. For example, Sagot and Fi?ser (2008) have
built WOLF, ?a free French Wordnet? and Navigli and Ponzetto (2010) BabelNet, a large multilingual
semantic network. Such resources tend to favor coverage over reliability and may contain errors and

inaccuracy, or be incomplete. Pierrel (2013), while criticizing these resources, describes the digitization
process of the Tr?esor de la Langue Franc?aise, a large printed French dictionary. The first impulse of this
long-course reverse-engineering project is described in (Dendien, 1994) and resulted in the TLFi, a fine-
grained XML-structured dictionary. Pierrel advocates mutualization, recommends resources sharing and
underlines how the use of the TLFi would be relevant for NLP. Though we totally agree on this assertion,
we deplore that the resource, being only available for manual use and not for download, prevents its use
for NLP.
Crowdsourcing has recently renewed the field of lexical resources development. For example Lafour-
cade (2007) designed JeuxDeMots, a game with a purpose, to collect a great number of relations between
words. Other works use the content of wikis produced by crowds of contributors. Initially in the shadow
of Wikipedia, the use of Wiktionary tends to grow in NLP studies since its exploitation by Zesch et al.
(2008). Its potential as an electronic lexicon was first studied by Navarro et al. (2009) for English and
French. The authors leverage the dictionary to build a synonymy network and perform random walks to
find missing links. Other works tackled data extraction: Anton P?erez et al. (2011) for instance, describe
the integration of the Portuguese Wiktionary and Onto.PT; S?erasset (2012) built Dbnary, a multilingual
network containing ?easily extractable? entries. If the assessment of Wiktionary?s quality from a lex-
icographic point of view has not been done yet, Zesch and Gurevych (2010) have shown that lexical
resources built by crowds lead to results comparable to those obtained with resources designed by pro-
fessionals, when used to compute semantic relatedness of words. In Sajous et al. (2013a), we created an
inflectional and phonological lexicon from Wiktionary and showed that its quality is comparable to those
of reference lexicons, while the coverage is much wider.
Comparatively little effort has been reported in literature on the exploitation of semantic relations to
automatically identify morphological relations. Schone and Jurafsky (2000) learn morphology with a
method based on semantic similarity extracted by latent semantic analysis. Baroni et al. (2002) combine
orthographic (string edit distances) and semantic similarity (words? contextual information) in order to
discover morphologically related words. Along the same line, Zweigenbaum and Grabar (2003) ac-
quire semantic information from a medical corpus and use it to detect morphologically derived words.
More recently, Hathout (2008) uses the TLFi to discover morphologically related words by combining
orthographic and semantic similarity with formal analogy.
I another work, Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) present a method to automatically extract
morphological relations from the definitions of MRDs. The authors automatically identify classes of
morphologically related words by comparing the semantic information in the entry of the derivative
with the information stored in the candidate base form. This effort shows the crucial importance and the
potential of the MRDs? definitions to acquire and discover morphological relationships of derived words.
3 Turning the French Wiktionary into a Machine-Readable Dictionary
As mentioned is section 2, the quality of collaboratively constructed resources has already been assessed
and we will not debate further the legitimacy of leveraging crowdsourced data for NLP purpose. We give
below a brief description of Wiktionary
1
and of the process of converting it into a structured resource.
Wiktionary is divided in language editions. Each language edition is regularly released as a so-called
XML dump.
2
The ?XML? mention is somewhat misleading because it suggests that XML markups
encode the articles? microstructure whereas only the macrostructure (articles? boundaries and titles) is
marked by XML tags. Remaining information is encoded in wikicode, an underspecified format used by
the MediaWiki content-management system. As explained by Sajous et al. (2013b) and S?erasset (2012),
this loose encoding format makes it difficult to extract consistent data. One can choose to either restrict
the extraction to prototypical articles or design a fine-grained parser that collects the maximum of the
available information. The former goal is relatively easily feasible but leads to a resource containing only
a small subset of Wiktionary?s entries. Our belief is that the tedious engineering work of handling all

Figure 1: Wikicode extract of the noun course
wikicode particularities is valuable. In our case, it enabled us to design an unprecedented large copylefted
lexicon that has no equivalent for French.
The basic unit of Wiktionary?s articles is the word form: several words from different languages having
the same word form occur in the same page (at the same URL). In such a page, a given language section
may be divided in several parts of speech which may in turn split into several homonyms subsections.
In the French Wiktionary, the course entry, for example, describes both the French and English lexemes.
The French section splits into a noun section (une course ?a run; a race?) and a section related to the
inflected forms of the verb courser ?to pursue?. The noun section distinguishes 11 senses that all have
definitions illustrated by examples. An extract of the noun section?s wikicode is depicted in Figure 1.
As can be seen, some wiki conventions are recurrent (e.g. double-brackets mark hyperlinks) and are
easy to handle. Handling dynamic templates (marked by curly brackets) is more tricky. In definitions,
they mark notes related to particular domains, registers, usages, geographic areas, languages, etc. In
Figure 1, the pattern {{sport}} indicates that the second sense relates to the domain of sport ; the pattern
{{vieilli|fr}} in the following definition denotes a dated usage ; the pattern {{figur?e|fr}} in the last
definition indicates a figurative one. We inventoried about 6,000 such templates and their aliases: for
example, 4 patterns (abbreviated or full form, with or without ligature) signal the domain of enology:
{{?nologie|fr}}, {{oenologie|fr}}, {{?nol|fr}} and {{oenol|fr}}. Unfortunately, the existence of
such patterns does not prevent a contributor to directly write domain name in the page: several versions
of ?hardcoded domains? may be found, e.g. (oenologie) or (?nologie).
Inventorying all these variations enabled us: 1) to remove them from the definitions? text and 2) to
mark them in a formal way. Thus, one can decide to remove or keep, on demand, entries that are marked
as rare or dated, build a sublexicon of a given domain, remove diatopic variations or investigate only
these forms (e.g. words that are used only in Quebec), etc.
The variations observed in the definitions also occur in phonemic transcriptions, inflectional features,
semantic relations, etc. We focus here only on the information used in sections 6 and 7: definitions
and morphological relations. However, we parsed Wiktionnaire?s full content and extracted all kind of
available information, handling the numerous variations that we observed to convert the online dictio-
nary into a structured resource, that we called GLAWI.
3
It contains more than 1.4 million inflected forms
(about 190,000 lemmas) with their definitions, examples, lexicosemantic relations and translations, de-
rived terms and phonemic transcriptions. A shortened extract resulting from the conversion of the noun
section of course is depicted in Figure 2. As can be seen, GLAWI includes both XML structured data
and the initial corresponding wikicode. This version of the resource is intended to remain close to the
Wiktionnaire?s content, whereas other lexicons focused on a particular aspect will be released. Our aim
is to provide ready-to-use lexicons resulting from different post-processing of GLAWI. Post-processing

Figure 2: Extract of the noun subsection of course converted into a workable format
steps will consist in 1) selecting information relevant to a particular need (e.g. phonemic transcriptions,
semantic relations, etc.) and 2) detecting inconsistencies and correcting them. The initial GLAWI re-
source, containing all the initial information, will also be released so that anyone can apply additional
post-processings. GLAWI unburdens such users from the efforts of parsing the wikicode.
Articles from Wiktionnaire may contain morphologically derived terms. Figures 1 and 2 show that
course produces the derived verb courser and noun coursier ?courier?. Such derivational relations are
collected from Wiktionnaire and included in GLAWI. We show below how we leverage this information,
in addition to GLAWI?s definitions, to acquire morphological and morphosemantic knowledge.
4 Acquisition of morphological relations from GLAWI morphological subsections
We first extracted from GLAWI the list of the lexeme headwords that have typographically simple writ-
ten forms (only letters) and that belong to the major POS: noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. This list
(GLAWI-HW) contains 152,567 entries: 79,961 nouns, 22,646 verbs, 47,181 adjective and 2,779 ad-
verbs). In what follows, we only consider these words.
Then we created a morphological lexicon extracted from the morphological subsections
4
of GLAWI
(hereafter GMS). The lexicon consists of all pairs of words (w
1
, w
2
), where w
1
and w
2
belong to
GLAWI-HW and where w
2
is listed in one of the morphological subsections of the article of w
1
or
vice versa. GMS contains 97,058 pairs. The extraction of this lexicon from GLAWI was very simple, all
the variability in Wiktionnaire?s lexicographic descriptions being supported by our parser (see Section 3).
The remainder of the paper presents two methods for extending GMS. In a first experiment, we com-
plement this lexicon with new pairs acquired from GLAWI?s definitions. In a second one, we show how
some of GMS?s morphological pairs can be classified with respect to a given semantic class.
4
The morphological subsections appear under 4 headings in Wiktionnaire: apparent?es; apparent?es ?etymologiques; com-
pos?es; d?eriv?es.

5 Morphological definitions
Basically, a dictionary definition is a pair composed of a word and a gloss of its meaning. In the follow-
ing, we will use the terms definiendum for the defined word, definiens for the defining gloss and the
notation definiendum = definiens. The definition articulates a number of lexical semantic relations be-
tween the definiendum and some words of the definiens as in (1) where chair is a hyponym of furniture,
is the holonym of seat, legs, back and arm rests and is also the typical instrument of sit on. Some of the
relations are made explicit by lexical markers as used to or comprising.
(1) chair
N
= An item of furniture used to sit on or in comprising a seat, legs, back, and some-
times arm rests, for use by one person.
Martin (1983) uses these relations to characterize the definitions. In his typology, definitions as in (2)
are considered to be (morphological) derivational because the definiendum is defined with respect to
a morphologically related word. In these definitions, the lexical semantic relation only involves two
words that are morphologically related. Being members of the same derivational family, the orthographic
representations of these words show some degree of similarity that can help us identify the morphological
definitions. In (2) for example, the written forms nitrificateur ?nitrifying? and nitrification ?nitrification?
share a 10 letters prefix and only differ by 3 letters. This strong similarity is a reliable indicator of their
morphologically relatedness (Hathout, 2011b). Building on this observation, a definition is likely to be
morphological if its definiens contains a word which is orthographically similar to the definiendum.
(2) nitrificateur
A
= Qui produit, qui favorise la nitrification.
?nitrifying? ?that produces, that favors nitrification?
We used Proxinette, a measure of morphological similarity defined in (Hathout, 2008), to identify the
morphological definitions. Proxinette is designed to reduce the search space for derivational analogies.
The reduction is obtained by bringing closer the words that belong to the same derivational families and
series, since it is precisely within these paradigms that an entry is likely to form analogies (Hathout,
2011a). Proxinette describes the lexemes by all the n-grams of characters that appear in their inflected
forms in order to catch the inflectional stem allomorphy because it tends to also show up in derivation
(Bonami et al., 2009). The n-grams have an additional tag that indicates if they occur at the beginning,
at the end or in the middle of the word. This information is described by adding a # at the beginning
and end of the written forms. For example, in Figure 4, localisation ?localization?, localiser ?localize;
locate? and focalisation ?focalization? share the ions# ending because it occurs in their inflected forms
localisations (plural), localisions (1st person plural, indicative, imperfect) and focalisations (plural). n-
grams of size 1 and 2 are ignored because they occur in too many words and are not discriminant enough.
Proxinette builds a bipartite graph with the words of the lexicon on one side and the features (n-grams)
that characterize them on the other. Each word is linked to all its features and each feature is connected
to the words that own it (see Figure 4). The graph is weighted so that the sum of weights of the outgoing
edges of each node is equal to 1. Morphological similarity is estimated by simulating the spreading of
an activation. For a given entry, an activation is initiated at the node that represents it. This activation is
then propagated towards the features of the entry. In a second step, the activations in the feature nodes
are propagated towards the words that possess them. The words which obtain the highest activations are
the most similar to the entry. The edge weights and the way the graph is traversed brings closer the words
that share the largest number of common features and the most specific ones (i.e. the less frequent).

Figure 5: The most similar words to the noun localisation. Words in boldface belong to the derivational
family of localisation. Words in light type belong to its derivational series.
We applied Proxinette to GLAWI-HW and calculated for each of them a neighborhood consisting of
the 100 most similar words. Figure 5 shows an excerpt of the neighborhood of the noun localisation.
The occurrence of the verb localiser in this list enables us to identify the morphological definition (3).
(3) localisation
N
= Action de localiser, de se localiser.
?localization? ?the act of localizing, of locating?
The two experiments we conducted use the same data, namely the morphological definitions of GLAWI.
These definitions are selected as follows:
1. We extracted all GLAWI definition glosses (definientia) with their entries and POS (definienda).
2. We syntactically parsed the definientia with the Talismane dependency parser (Urieli, 2013). Figure
6 presents the dependencies syntactic trees for the definientia in (4).
3. We tagged as morphological all definitions where, in the parsed definiens, at least one lemma
(henceforth referred to as morphosemantic head) occurs in the definiendum neighborhood. For
example, in (4), both definitions are tagged as morphological because arr?eter occurs in the neigh-
borhood of arr?et, and d?ecouronner and couronne occur in that of d?ecouronnement.
(4) a. arr?et
N
= Action de la main pour arr?eter le cheval.
?stop? ?action of the hand to stop the horse?
b. d?ecouronnement
N
= L?action de d?ecouronner, d?enlever la couronne.
?uncrowning? ?the act of uncrowning, of removing the crown?
Morphosemantic heads may be the derivational base of the definiendum like d?ecouronner, a more distant
ancestor like couronne or a ?sibling? like in (2) where nitrification is a derivative of the definiendum base
nitrifier ?nitrify?.

6 Acquisition of morphological relations from GLAWI morphological definitions
We extracted from GLAWI?s morphological definitions the pairs of words (w
1
, w
2
) where w
1
is the
definiendum and w
2
the definiens morphosemantic heads (or one of its morphosemantic head if it has
many). After symmetrization, we obtained a lexicon (hereafter GMD) of 107,628 pairs. 32,256 of them
belongs to GMS. A manual check of the 75,372 remaining pairs would enable its addition to GMS.
GMD additional pairs have been evaluated by three judges in two steps. The judges were instructed to
set aside the orthographic variants as desperado N / desp?erado N. We first randomly selected 100 pairs
and had them checked by three judges in order to estimate the inter-annotator agreement. The average
F-measure of the agreement is 0.97 ; Fleiss?s kappa is 0.65. The judges then checked 100 randomly
selected pairs each. 9 out of the 300 pairs were variants and 19 errors were found in the 291 remaining
ones which results in an overall accuracy of 93.5%. This method would lead to an increase of GMS by
more than 70,000 pairs.
The general quality of these acquired pairs can be significantly increased by formal analogy filter-
ing. The idea is to use analogy as a proxy to find pairs of words that are in the same morphological
relation. GMS pairs being provided by Wiktionary contributors, we consider them as correct and use
them as analogical patterns to filter out the pairs acquired from the morphological definitions. By formal
analogy, we mean an analogy between the orthographic representations. For instance, the GMD pair cit-
rique A:citron N form an analogy with ?electrique A:?electron N. The latter being correct, we can assume
that the former is correct too.
(5) a. citrique A : citron N = ?electrique A : ?electron N
b. fragmentation N : d?efragmenter V = concentration N : d?econcentrer V
Analogies between strings are called formal analogies (Lepage, 2003; Stroppa and Yvon, 2005). One
way to check a formal analogy is to find a decomposition (or factorization) of the four strings such that
the differences between the first two are identical to the ones between the second two. In the analogy
in (5a), the ending ique is replaced by on and the POS A by N in both pairs. We applied analogical
filtering to GMS and GMD pairs. 86,228 pairs in GMD form at least one analogy with a pair in GMS;
53,972 of them do not occur in GMS. 300 of these pairs have been checked by three judges. They only
found 3 variants and one error. The obtained accuracy is therefore over 99% (see Table 1).

GMD morphological relations will not be included into GLAWI. GMS and GMD are made available
as separate resources on the GLAWI web page.
7 Semantic typing of the morphological definitions
The next experiment aims to demonstrate that morphological definitions could easily and quite accurately
be typed semantically. We focus on a particular semantic type, namely definitions of process nominals
such as (6) because they can be evaluated with respect to the Verbaction database (Hathout and Tanguy,
2002). Deverbal nominals have been extensively studied in linguistics (Pustejovsky, 1995) and used
in a number of tools for various tasks. One of their distinctive feature is that they almost have the
same meaning as their base verb. For instance, in (7) the noun and verb phrases are paraphrases of one
another. Verbaction contains 9,393 verb-noun pairs where the noun is morphologically related to the
verb and can be used to express the act denoted by the verb (e.g. verrouiller:verrouillage).

It has been

Unfortunately, these results could not have been compared with those of Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) because
their system makes use of a number of lexical and semantic resources that are not available for French. However, a comparison
with Baroni et al. (2002) is underway although their method is corpus-based (and not MRD-based).

used in syntactic dependency parsing by Bourigault (2007), in the construction of the French TimeBank
by Bittar et al. (2011), in question answering systems by Bernhard et al. (2011), etc.
(6) verrouillage
N
= Action de verrouiller.
?locking? ?the act of locking.?
(7) nous v
?
erouillons la porte rapidement ?we quickly lock the gate?
le verrouillage de la porte est rapide ?gate locking is quick?
In our experiment, we used the linear SVM classifier liblinear of Fan et al. (2008) to assign a semantic
type to the definitions that have a nominal definiendum and where the morphosemantic head of the
definiens is a verb as in (4) or (6). Verbaction was used to select a corpus of 1,198 of such definitions.
Three judges annotated them. 608 definientia were tagged as processive and 590 ones as non processive.
We then divided the corpus into a test set made up of 100 processive and 100 non processive definitions
and a training set consisting of the remaining definientia.
The classifier is trained to recognize that the definientia in (4) express the same semantic relation
between the morphosemantic head of the definiens and the definiendum. We use the method proposed
by (Hathout, 2008) to capture this semantic similarity. Definientia are described by a large number
of redundant features based on lemmata, POSs and syntactic dependencies. The features are n-grams
calculated from Talismane parses (see figure 6). They are defined as follows:
1. We first collect all the paths that go from one word in the definiens to the syntactic root (e.g. [arr?eter,
pour, action] is a path that starts at arr?eter in (4a)).
2. We extract all the n-grams of consecutive nodes in these paths.
3. Each n-gram yields 3 features: the sequence of the node?s lemmata, the sequence of the nodes POS,
and the sequence of syntactic dependency relations.
We obtained an accuracy of 97% for the semantic typing of the 200 definientia of the test set. The
most immediate application of the classifier is the enrichment of Verbaction. Running the classifier on
all the definitions with a nominal definiendum and a verbal morphosemantic head will provide us with
new couples that could be added to the database. The classifier could also help us type process nouns
that are not morphologically derived such as audition ?hearing? which is defined with respect to the verb
entendre ?hear?. Similar typing could be performed for other semantic types such as agent nouns (in -eur
or -ant), change of state verbs (in -iser or -ifier) or adjectives expressing possibility (in -able), etc. The
experiment also shows that morphological definitions are well suited for semantic analysis because they
express regular semantic relationship between pairs of words that are distinguished by their orthographic
similarity.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented GLAWI, an XML machine-readable dictionary created from Wiktion-
naire, the French edition of the Wiktionary project. We then showed that GLAWI was well suited for
conducting computational morphology experiments. GLAWI contains morphological subsections which
provide a significant number of valid and varied morphological relations. In addition, morphological re-
lations can also be acquired from GLAWI morphological definitions. We presented a method to identify
these definitions and the words in relation with a fairly good accuracy. We then used formal analogy to
filter out almost all the erroneous pairs acquired from morphological definitions. In a second experiment,
we demonstrate how to assign the morphological definitions to semantic types with a high accuracy.
This work opens several research avenues leading to a formal representation of the different form
and meaning relations that underlie derivational morphology. The next move will be to organize the
morphological relations into a graph similar to D?emonette (Hathout and Namer, 2014) and identify the
paradigms which structure them. We also plan to apply the semantic classification to other semantic
types which could ultimately enable us to explore the intricate interplay between form and meaning.
