Abstract 
We present a new statistical language 
model based on a Colnbination of 
individual word language models. Each 
word model is built from an individual 
corpus which is formed by extracting 
those subsets of the entire training corpus 
which contain that significant word. We 
also present a novel way of combining 
language models called the "union 
model", based on a logical union of 
intersections, and use this to combine the 
language models obtained for the 
significant words from a cache. The 
initial results with the new model provide 
a 20% reduction in language model 
perplexity over the standard 3-gram 
approach. 
Introduction 
Statistical language models are based on 
information obtained fiom the analysis of large 
samples of a target language. Such models 
estimate the conditional probability of a word 
given a sequence of preceding words. The 
conditional probability can be further used to 
determine the likelihood of a sentence through 
lhe product of the individual word probabilities. 
A popular type of statistical language model is 
lhe dynamic language model, which dynamically 
modifies conditional probabilities depending on 
the recent word history. For example the cached- 
based natural anguage models (Kuhn R. & De 
Mori R., 1990) incorporates a cache component 
into the model, which estimates the probability 
of a word depending upon its recent usage. 
Trigger based models go a step further by 
triggering associated words to each content word 
in a cache giving each associated word a higher 
probability (Lau et al, 1993). 
Our statistical language model, based 
upon individual word domains, extends these 
ideas by creating a new language model for each 
significant word in the cache. A significant word 
is hard to define; it is any word that significantly 
contributes to the content of the text. We define 
it as any word which is not a stop word, i. e. 
articles, prepositions and some of the most 
fiequcntly used words in the language such as 
"will", "now", "very", etc. Our model combines 
individual word language models with a standard 
global n-gram language model. 
A training corpus for each significant 
word is formed from the amalgamation of the 
text fiagments taken fiom the global training 
corpus in which that word appears. As such these 
corpora are smaller and closely constrained; 
hence the individual anguage models are more 
precise than the global language model and 
thereby should offer performance gains. One 
aspect of the performance of this joint model is 
how the global language model is to be 
combined with the individual word language 
models. This is explored later. 
This paper is organised as follows. 
Section 1 explains the basis for this model. The 
mathematical background and how the models 
are combined are explained in section 2. In the 
third section, a novel method of combining the 
word models, the probabilistic-union model is 
explained. Finally, results and conclusion are 
drawn.

1 Dynamic Language Model based on 
Word Language Models 
Our dynamic language model builds a 
language model for each individual word. In 
order to do this we need to select which words 
are to be classified as significant and furthermore 
create a language model for them. We excluded 
all the stop words ('is', 'to', 'all', 'some') due to 
their high frequency within tile text and their 
limited contribution to the thematic of the text. A 
list of stop words was obtained by merging 
together the lists used by various www search 
engines, for example Altavista. 
Secondly we need to create a dictionary 
that contains the frequency of each word ill the 
corpus. This is needed because we want to 
exclude those non-stop words which appear too 
often in the training corpus, for example words 
like 'dollars', 'point', etc. A hash file is 
constructed to store large amounts of information 
so that it can be retrieved quickly. 
The next step is to create tile global 
language model by obtaining the text phrases and 
their probabilities. Frequencies of words and 
phrases are derived fiom a large text corpus and 
the conditional probability of a word given a 
sequence of preceding words is estimated. These 
conditional probabilities are combined to 
produce an overall language model probability 
for any given word sequence. The probability of 
a sequence of words is: 
P(w 1 "" w,, ) = P(w\[' ) = 
- -P (w l )X  P(w2 I w l )x""  P(w" \[ w~'-l) = (1) 
i=I 
where w\[' ={wl,w2,w3,...,w,, } is a sentence or 
sequence of words. The individual conditional 
probabilities are approximated by the maximum 
likelihoods: 
PML(W~ Iw l -b  --  f req(w\ [ )  _ f , ' eq(w,  . . .  w~_,wp 
freq(wl q) freq(wl "" ~h-l) (2) 
where freq(X)is the frequency of the 
phrase X in the text. 
In equation (2), there are often unknown 
sequences of words i.e. phrases which are not in 
the dictionary. The maximum likelihood 
probability is then zero. In order to improve this 
prediction of all unseen event, and hence the 
language model, a number of techniques have 
been explored, for example, the Good-Turing 
estimate (Good I. J., 1953), the backing-off 
method (Katz S. M., 1987), deleted interpolation 
(Jelinek F. and Mercer R. L., 1984) or the 
weighted average n-gram model (O'Boyle P., 
Owens M. and Smith F. J., 1994). We use the 
weighted average n-gram technique (WA), which 
combines n-grain ~ phrase distributions of several 
orders using a series of weighting fnnctions. The 
WA n-gram model has been shown to exhibit 
similar predictive powers to other n-gram 
techniques whilst enjoying several benefits. 
Firstly an algorithm for a WA model is relatively 
straightforward to implement ill computer 
software, secondly it is a variable n-gram model 
with the length depending on the context and 
finally it facilitates easy model extension 2. The 
weighted average probability of a woM given the 
preceding words is 
,,tj,,,, (w) + ~ & l,,,,.(,, I ,',,,, ,...,,',.,) 
&,,, (,,, I ,,,, ..-w,,, ) - '-' (3) 
i 0 
where the weighted funct ions  are: 
,,t o = Ln( N),  (4) 
-- 2 
N is tile number of tokens ill tile corpus and 
freq(wm+l_i...w,,~) is the frequency of tile 
senteuce Win+l_  i " ' "  W m in the text. 
The maximum likelihood probability of a word 
is: 
J A n-gram model contains the conditional probability 
of a word dependant on the previous i1 words. (Jclinek 
F., Mercer R.L. and Bahl L. R., 1983) 
2 Tile "ease of extension" applies to the fact that 
additional training data can be incorporated into an 
existing WA model without the need to re-estimate 
smoothing parameters. 
790 
P,,,,.(,,,)--??q (')  (5) 
N 
J?eq(w) is the frequency of the word w in the 
text. This language model (defined by equation 
(3) and (5)) is what we term a standard n-gram 
language model or global language model. 
Finally the last step is the creation of a 
hmguage model for each significant word, which 
is formed in the same manner as the global 
language model. The word language-training 
corpus to be used is tlle amalgamation of the text 
fiagments taken from the global training corpus 
in which the significant word appears. A number 
of choices can be made as to how the word- 
training corpus for each significant word can be 
selected. We initially construct what we termed 
the "paragraph context model", entailing that the 
global training corpus is scanned for a particular 
word and each time the word is found the 
paragraph containing that word is extracted. The 
paragraphs of text extracted for a particular word 
are joined together to form an individual word- 
training corpus, from which an individual word 
language model is built. Alternative methods 
include storing only the sentences where the 
word appears or extracting a piece of the text M- 
words before and M + words after the search 
word .  
Additionally some restrictions on the 
number of words were imposed. This was done 
due to the high frequency of certain words. Such 
words were omitted since the additional 
information that they provide is minimal 
(conversely language models for "rare" words 
are desirable as they provide significant 
additional iuformation to that contained within 
the global language model). Once individual 
language models have been formed for each 
significaut word (trained using the standard n- 
grain approach as used for the global lnodel), 
the.m remains the problem of how the individual 
word language models will be combined together 
with the global language model. 
2 Combining the Models 
We need to combine the probabilities 
obtained from each word language model and 
fiom the global language model, in order to 
obtain a conditional probability for a word given 
a sequence of words. The first model to be tested 
is an arithmetic combination of the global 
hmguage model and the word language models. 
All the word hmguage models and the global 
language model are weighted equally. We 
believe that words, which appear far away in the 
previous word history, do not have as nmch 
importance as the ones closest to the word. 
Therefore we need to lnake a restriction in the 
number of language models. First, the 
conditional probabilities obtained from the word 
hmguage models and the global language 
model can be combined in a linear 
interpolated model as follows: 
m 
P(w Iw") = ;co e?,,o,.., (w Iw;') + Z & v, (w I w',' ) 
i-~ (6) 
I l l  
where 2 c + .y_, 2 i = 1 (7) 
i I 
and l ' (wl , , i ' ) is  the conditional probability in 
the word language model for the significant word 
w i, 2 iare the correspondent weights and m is 
the maxinmm number of word models that we 
are including. 
If the same weight is given to all the 
word language models but not to the global 
language model and if a restriction on tim 
lmmber of word language models to be included 
is enforced, the weighted model is defined as: 
and ~ is a parameter which is chosen to optimise 
the model. 
Furthermore, a method was used based 
on all exponential decay of the word model 
probabilities with distance. This stands to reason, 
as a word appearing several words previously 
will generally be less relevant han more recent 
791 
words. Given a sequence of words, for example, 
"We had happy times in America..." 
We ltad Happy Times In America 
5 4 3 2 1 
where 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 represent the distance of the 
word from the word America, Happy and Times 
are significant words for which we have an 
individual word language models. The 
exponential decay model for the word w, where 
in this case w represents the significant word 
America, is as follows: 
/ . . . . . .  / I {;iot,,,t( w\[ w I ) + P.,.,py (w I wl )' exp(-3/d) 
P(wlw, )=\[  + 1,,,,,,,,(~, \]w, ).exp(21d) ) (9) 
l + exp(-3/d) + exp(-2/d) 
where Patot,,t(wl (') is the conditional 
probability of the word w following a phrase 
wl "" w,, in the global language model. 
Pmppy(Wl w~') is the conditional probability of the 
word w following a phrase w 1. . .%word 
language model for the significant word Happy. 
The same defnition applies for the word model 
Times. d is the exponential decay distance with 
d=5, 10, 15,etc. The decaying factor exp(-I/d) 
introduces a cut off: 
if l>d ~ exp(-l/d)=O 
where l is the word modelto word distance 
d is the decay distance 
Presently the combination methods 
outlined above have been experimentally 
explored. However, they offer a reasonably 
simplistic means of combining the individual and 
global language models. More sophisticated 
models are likely to offer improved performance 
gains. 
3 The Probabilistic-Union Model 
The next method is the Probabilistic- 
Union model. This model is based on the logical 
concept of a disjunction of conjunction which is 
implemented as a sum of products. The union 
model has been previously applied in problems 
of noisy speech recognition, (Ming J. et al, 
1999). Noisy conditions during speech 
recognition can have a serious effect on the 
likelihood of some features which are normally 
combined using the geometric mean. This noise 
has a zeroing effect upon the overall likelihood 
produced for that particular speech frame. The 
use of the probabilistic-union reduces the overall 
effect that each feature has in the colnbination, 
therefore loosening any zeroing effect. 
For the word language model, some of the 
conditional probabilities are zero or very small 
due to the small size of some of the word model 
corpora. For these word models, many of the 
words in the global training corpus are not in the 
word-model training-corpus dictionary. And so, 
the conditional probability will be in many cases 
zero or near zero reducing the overall 
probability. As in noisy speech @cognition we 
wish to reduce the effect of this zeroing in the 
combined model. The probabilistic-union model 
is one of the possible solutions for the zeroing 
problem when combining language models. 
The union model is best illustrated with 
an example when the number of word models to 
be included is m=4 and if they are assumed to be 
independent probabilities.

where P'~,io,,(w) =P~U,,io,, (wlw;') is the nnion 
model of order k. P/ = P,.(w\[ w(') is the 
conditional probability for the significant word 
w i and ~ is a normalizing constant. The 
symbol '?' is a probabilistic sum, i.e. its 
equivalent for 1 and 2 is: 
8,,,,d2 =8 ?",2 --e, +/'2 -8P2 (14) 
Tile combination of the global language 
model with the probabilistic-union model is 
792 
defined as follows: 
p(w\[ w~') = ~J~,o~,,,~(wl ,,\[')+(l-a)/}j,,,,,,(w \[ i') (15) 
Results 
To evaluate the behaviour of one language model 
with respect to others we use perplexity. It 
measures the average branching factor (per 
word) of the sequence at every new word, with 
respect to some source model. The lower the 
branching l'actor, the lower the model errors rate. 
Therefore, the lower the branching (l~erplexity) 
the better the model. Let w i be a word in the 
language model and w\[" = {wl, w 2, w3,..-, w,,, } 
a sentence or sequence of words. The perplexity 
of this sequence of words is: 
Peq) lex i ty (  w 1 w2 ...  w,, ) = PP(w~'  ) = 
t 1 " ._ \] 
= Z ('", I ,,'i' )) 
J I t  i=1 
(J6) 
The Wall Street Journal (version 
WSJ03) contains about 38 million words, and a 
dictionary of approxilnately 65,000 words. We 
select one quarter of the articles in the global 
training corpus as our training corpus (since the 
global training corpus is large and the 
normalisation process takes time). To test the 
new language model we use a subset of the test 
file given by WSJ0, selected at random. The 
training corpus that we are using contains 
172,796 paragraphs, 376,589 sentences, 
9526,187 tokens. The test file contains 150 
paragraphs, 486 sentences, 8824 tokens and 1908 
words types. Although the size of this test file is 
small, limher experilnents with bigger training 
corpora and test files are planned. 
Although in our first experiments we use 
5--grams in the calculation of the word models, 
the size of the n-gram has been reduced to 3- 
grains because the process of norlnalisation is 
slow in these experiments. 
The model based on a simple weighted 
colnbination offers ilnproved results, up to 10% 
when o~=0.6 in Eq. (8) and a combination of a 
maxilnuln of 10 word lnodels. Better esults were 
found when the word models were weighted 
depending on their distance from the current 
word, that is, for the exponential decay model in 
Eq. (9) where d=7 and the number of word 
models is selected by the exponential cut off 
(Table 1 ). For this model ilnprovelnents of over 
17% have been found.

For tile probabilistic-union model, we 
have as many nlodels as numbers of word 
language nlodels. For example, if we wish to 
include m=4 word language Jnodels, tile four 
union models are those with orders I to 4 
(equation (13) to (15)). The results for the 
probabilistic union model when the number of 
words models is m=5 and m=6 are shown in the

improvement of 20% when a maximum ot' 6 word

Conclusion 
In this paper we have introduced the 
concept of individual word language models to 
improve language model performance. 
Individual word language models permit an 
accurate capture of the domains in which 
significant words occur and hence improve the 
language model performance. We also describe a 
new method of combining models called the 
probabilistic union model, which has yet to be 
fully explored but the first results show good 
performance. Even though the results are 
preliminary, they indicate that individual word 
models combined with the union model offer a 
promising means of reducing the perplexity.

Abstract 
Zipf?s law states that the frequency of 
word tokens in a large corpus of natural 
language is inversely proportional to the 
rank. The law is investigated for two 
languages English and Mandarin and for n-
gram word phrases as well as for single 
words. The law for single words is shown 
to be valid only for high frequency words. 
However, when single word and n-gram 
phrases are combined together in one list 
and put in order of frequency the combined 
list follows Zipf?s law accurately for all 
words and phrases, down to the lowest 
frequencies in both languages. The Zipf 
curves for the two languages are then 
almost identical.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
The law discovered empirically by Zipf 
(1949) for word tokens in a corpus states that if 
f is the frequency of a word in the corpus and r 
is the rank, then: 
r
kf =  (1) 
where k is a constant for the corpus. When 
log(f) is drawn against log(r) in a graph (which 
is often called a Zipf curve), a straight line is 
obtained with a slope of ?1. An example with a 
small corpus of 250,000 tokens is given in 
Figure 1. Zipf?s discovery was followed by a 
large body of literature reviewed in a series of 
papers edited by Guiter and Arapov (1982). It 
continues to stimulate interest today 
(Samuelson, 1996; Montermurro, 2002; Ferrer 
and Sol?, 2002) and, for example, it has been 
applied to citations Silagadze (1997) and to 
DNA sequences (Yonezawa & Motohasi, 1999; 
Li, 2001).

Zipf discovered the law by analysing 
manually the frequencies of words in the novel 
?Ulysses? by James Joyce. It contains a 
vocabulary of 29,899 different word types 
associated with 260,430 word tokens. 
Following its discovery in 1949, 
several experiments aided by the appearance of 
the computer in the 1960?s, confirmed that the 
law was correct for the small corpora which 
could be processed at that time. The slope of 
the curve was found to vary slightly from ?1 
for some corpora; also the frequencies for the 
highest ranked words sometimes deviated 
slightly from the straight line, which suggested 
several modifications of the law, and in 
particular one due to Mandelbrot (1953): 
?? )( += r
kf  (2) 
where ? and ? are constants for the corpus 
being analysed. However, generally the 
constants ? and ? were found to be only small 
statistical deviations from the original law by 
Zipf (exceptions are legal texts which have 
smaller ? values (?0.9) showing that lawyers 
use more words than other people!)(Smith & 
Devine, 1985). 
A number of theoretical developments 
of Zipf?s law had been derived in the 50?s and 
60?s and have been reviewed by Fedorowicz 
(1982), notably those due to Mandelbrot (1954, 
1957) and Booth (1967). A well-known 
derivation, due to Simon (1955), is based on 
empirically derived distribution functions. 
However, Simon?s derivation was controversial 
and a correspondence in the scientific press 
developed between Mandelbrot and Simon on 
the validity of this derivation (1959-1961); the 
dispute was not resolved by the time Zipf 
curves for larger corpora were beginning to be 
computed. 
The processing of larger corpora with 1 
million words or more was facilitated by the 
development of PC?s in the 1980?s. When Zipf 
curves for these corpora were drawn they were 
found to drop below the Zipf straight line with 
slope of ?1 at the bottom of the curve, starting 
for rank greater than about 5000. This is 
illustrated in Figure 2 which shows the Zipf 
curve for the Brown corpus of 1 million words 
of American English (Francis & Kucera, 1964).

This appeared to confirm the opinion of 
the opponents of Simon?s derivation: the law 
clearly did not hold for r>5000; so it appeared 
that the derivation must be invalid. 
 
2. Zipf Curves for Large Corpora 
 
This paper is principally concerned 
with exploring the above invalidity of Zipf?s 
law for large corpora in two languages, English 
and Mandarin. We begin with English. 
 
English corpora 
 
The English corpora used in our 
experiments are taken from the Wall Street 
journal (Paul & Baker, 1992) for 1987, 1988, 
1989, with sizes approximately 19 million, 16 
million and 6 million tokens respectively. The 
Zipf curves for the 3 corpora are shown in 
Figure 3.

 Figure 3 Zipf curves for the unigrams extracted from 
the 3 training corpora of the WSJ 
The curves are parallel, showing 
similar structures and all 3 deviating from 
Zipf?s law for larger r. Their separation is due 
to their different sizes. 
Language is not made of individual 
words but also consists of phrases of 2, 3 and 
more words, usually called n-grams for n=2, 3, 
etc. For each value of n between 2 and 5, we 
computed the frequencies of all n-gram in each 
corpus and put them in rank order as we had 
done for the words. This enabled us to draw the 
Zipf curves for 2-grams to 5-grams which are 
shown along with the single word curves in 
Figures 4, 5 and 6 for the three corpora. These 
curves are similar to the first Zipf curves drawn 
for n-grams by Smith and Devine (1985); but 
these earlier curves were for a much smaller 
corpus.

The n-gram Zipf curves approximately 
follow straight lines and can be represented by 
a single Mandelbrot form: 
?

kf =  (3) 
where ? is the magnitude of the negative slope 
of each line. We found the values of ? for the 
WSJ in Table 1.

Mandarin corpora 
 
The Mandarin corpus used in our experiments 
is the TREC Corpus. It was obtained from the 
People?s Daily Newspaper from 01/1991 to 
12/1993 and from the Xinhua News Agency for 
04/1994 to 09/1995 from the Linguistic Data 
Consortium (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu). TREC 
has  19,546,872  tokens  similar in size to the 
largest of the English corpora. The Mandarin 
language is a syllable-class language, in which 
each syllable is at the same time a word and a 
Chinese character. Other words, compound 
words, are built up by combining syllables 
together, similar to word n-grams in English. 
The most common unigrams, bigrams and 
trigrams are listed in Table 3.  
The number of syllable-types (i.e. 
unigrams) in the TREC corpus is  only  6,300, 
very different from English (the WSJ87 corpus 
has 114,718 word types); so it is not surprising 
that the Zipf curve for unigrams in Mandarin in 
Figure 7 is very different from the Zipf curve 
for unigrams in English. It is similar to a 
previous curve for a smaller Mandarin corpus 
of 2,022,604 tokens by Clark, Lua and 
McCallum (1986). The Zipf curves for n-grams

Figure 7 Zipf curves for the TREC Mandarin corpus 
Except for the unigrams, the shapes of 
the other TREC n-gram Zipfian curves are 
similar to but not quite the same as those for 
the  English corpora.  In particular  the   bigram 
curve  for  Mandarin  is  more  curved  than  the 
English curve because there are more 
compound words in Mandarin than English.  
The Mandarin ?-values in Table 1 are 
also higher than for English, on average by 
about 0.1, which is due to the different 
distribution of unigrams. For TREC, the 
crossing point between the unigram curve and 
the bigram curve is at rank: 1224, frequency: 
1750, unigram: " ", bigram: " ". The 
unigram curve and the trigram curve cross each 
other at rank: 1920, frequency: 491, unigram: 
" ", trigram: " ". This is very 
different from English. 
Comparisons between the n-grams 
curves (n = 1 to 4) for English and Mandarin 
are made in Figure 8, 9, 10 and 11. The English 
curves are for the 3 WSJ corpora joined 
together making a 40 million word corpus.

3. Combined n-grams 
 
 The derivation of Zipf?s law by Simon 
was based solely on single words and it failed 
for English when the number of word types 
was greater than about 5000 words. In 
Mandarin it failed almost immediately for 
unigrams because of the limited number of 
characters. However it might not have failed if 
the Mandarin compound words in the bigram, 
trigram and higher n-gram statistics had been 
included; this suggested that the n-gram and 
unigram curves should be combined. Perhaps 
the same may be true for English. So we should 
combine the English curves also. 
 This can be justified in another way. In 
a critical part of his derivation Simon gives an 
initial probability to a new word found in the 
corpus as it introduces some new meaning not 
expressed by previous words. However, as the 
number of words increases new ideas are 
frequently expressed not in single words, but in 
multi-word phrases or compound words. This 
was left out of Simon?s derivation. If he had 
included it, the law he derived would have 
included phrases as well as words. So perhaps 
Zipf?s law should include words and phrases. 
We therefore put all unigram and n-
gram together with their frequencies into one 
large file, sorted on frequency and put in rank 
order as previously. The resulting Zipf curve 
for the combined curves for both English and 
Mandarin are shown in Figure 12.

and the TREC Mandarin corpora 
 
This shows that the n-grams (n > 2) 
exactly make up for the deviation of the two 
very different unigram curves from Zipf?s law 
and the combined curves for both languages are 
straight lines with slopes close to ?1 for all 
ranks>100. This result appears to vindicate 
Simon?s derivation. However, whether Simon?s 
derivation is entirely valid or not, the results in 
Figure 12 are a new confirmation of Zipf?s 
original law in an extended form. This 
remarkable result has been found to be valid for 
3 other natural languages: Irish, Latin and 
Vietnamese, in preliminary experiments.
