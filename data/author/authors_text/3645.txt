Abstract
We address a dialogue framework that narrows
down the users query results obtained by an in
formation retrieval system The followup dia
logue to constrain query results is signicant es
pecially with the speech interfaces such as tele
phones because a lot of query results cannot be
presented to the user The proposed dialogue
framework generates guiding questions based on
an information theoretic criterion to eliminate
retrieved candidates by a spontaneous query
without assuming a semantic slot structure We
rst describe its concept on general information
query tasks and then deal with a query task
on the appliance manual where structured task
knowledge is available A hierarchical conrma
tion strategy is proposed by making use of a tree
structure of the manual and then three cost
functions for selecting optimal question nodes
are compared Experimental evaluation demon
strates that the proposed system helps users
nd their intended items more eciently
 Introduction
In the past years a great number of spoken
dialogue systems have been developed Their
typical task domains include airline information
Levin et al 			
 Potamianos et al 			

SanSegundo et al 			 and train information
Allen et al 
 Bennacef et al 
 Sturm
et al 
 Lamel et al  Most of them
model speech understanding process as convert
ing recognition results into semantic representa
tions equivalent to database query SQL com
mands and dialogue process as disambiguating
their unxed slots Usually the semantic slots
are dened a priori and manually The approach
is workable only when data structure of the ap
plication is wellorganized typically as a rela
tional database RDB
Dierent and more exible approach is
needed for spoken dialogue interfaces to ac
cess information described in less rigid format
in particular normal text database For the
purpose information retrieval IR technique is
useful to nd a list of matching documents from
the input query Typically keywords are ex
tracted from the query and statistical matching
is performed Call routing task ChuCarroll
and Carpenter  can be regarded as the
special case
In IR systems many candidates are usually
obtained as a query result thus there is a sig
nicant problem of how to nd the users in
tended item among them Especially either on
the telephone or electrical appliances there is
not a large screen displaying the candidates and
all the query results cannot be presented to a
user So it is desirable for the system to narrow
down the query results interactively Moreover
interactive query is more friendly to novice users
rather than requiring them to input a detailed
query from the beginning
In this paper we address a dialogue strat
egy to nd the users intended item from the
retrieved result which is initiated by a spon
taneous query utterance In section  we de
scribe a method to generate a guiding question
that narrows down the query results eciently
using an example of a restaurant query task
The question is selected based on an informa
tion theoretic criterion In section  we present
a dialogue management method for a query task
on the appliance manual where structured task
knowledge is available We propose a conr
mation strategy by making use of a tree struc
ture of the manual and dene three cost func
tions for selecting question nodes The method
is evaluated by the number of average dialogue
turns
Although there are previous studies on
optimizing dialogue strategies Niimi and
Kobayashi 
 Levin et al 
 Litman
et al 			 most of them assume the tasks
of lling semantic slots that are denitely and
manually dened and few focus on followup
dialogue of information retrieval For example
Denecke  proposed a method to generate
guiding questions by making use of a tree struc
ture constructed by unifying retrieved items
based on semantic slots In this paper we do
not assume any structure of semantic slots In
stead we make use of distribution of document
statistics or a structure of task knowledge We
also investigate cost functions for optimal dia
logue control by taking into account of speech
recognition errors
 Dialogue Strategy in General
Information Query Task
Interaction in an information query task can be
regarded as a process seeking a common part
between the users request and system knowl
edge In order to help users to nd their in
tended items from the system knowledge the
system has to carry out not only interpreting
what users say but also showing the relevant
portion of the system knowledge to them
We assume that users freely set and retract
query keys based on their preference for infor
mation query systems If many candidates still
remain even after specifying all possible hisher
preference to the system users may have di
culty in narrowing down further the query re
sult Thus the system should generate ecient
guiding questions to help users nd their in
tended items
In this section we presume the system knowl
edge as a pair of an item and a set of keywords
Figure  We dene keywords as a set of
words representing contents of the items and
their categories such as place food and so on
are given This is similar to indexing words in
a conventional information retrieval task Note
that it is not needed that the system knowledge
is structured like an RDB
Keywords are extracted from a users utter
ance and are matched with the system knowl
edge Here we adopt the following matching

keyword i Komatani and Kawahara 			 N
is the total number of items and df

is the num
ber of items including keyword i Intuitively
keyword that is recognized with high condence
and does not appear in many items gets higher
likelihood L
j
by CM
i
and df

 respectively
Then we dene amount of information that
is obtained when the system generates yesno
question and the user answers it Here C is a
current query condition A is a condition that
is added by the systems question and countx
is the number of items that satisfy the condi
tion x The condition consists of the conjunc
tion of the keywords the user specied Suppose
each item occurs by equal likelihood the fol
lowing equation denotes the likelihood p


By calculating HA for all conditions A that
can be added to the current query condition
the system generates the question that has the
maximum value of HA The question is gen
erated using the category information of each
keyword
Because the obtained condition A is selected
by a viewpoint of narrowing down the current
set of items eciently the selected condition
may be unimportant for the user In such a case
it is not cooperative to force the user an ar
mative or negative reply Our system does not
force the reluctant decision by allowing the user
to say It does not matter anyhow Instead
the system presents the second best proposal
We explain the method with the following ex
ample in our restaurant query system in the
Tokyo area When a user says Please tell me a
restaurant where I can eat Chinese noodle and
meat dumpling in Shinjuku area three key
words are extracted Shinjuku Chinese noo
dle and meat dumpling As a result of the
matching using these three keywords  query
results are obtained It is not cooperative to
read out all of the  query results with a TTS
texttospeech system Here the expected val
ues of amount of information HA are calcu
lated for each condition that corresponds to key
words included in the matched items except for
the three keywords Shinjuku Chinese noo
dle and meat dumpling Then we select the
keyword noodles with boiledporkribs that
has the maximum value HA By generating a
question like Would you like one which serves
noodles with boiledporkribs and obtaining
a reply from the user the system adds the new
condition and narrows down the candidates ef
ciently If the user thinks that the condition
noodles with boiledporkribs is not impor
tant and tells the system so for example Ei
ther will do the system can show the second
best proposal Would you like one located in
Kabukicho area Thus the query result can
be narrowed down without forcing the user un
natural yesno answers
 Dialogue Strategy for Query on
Appliance Manuals
In this section we present another ecient solu
tion in the case that the structure or hierarchy
of task knowledge is available The task here
is to nd the appropriate item in the manual
of electric appliances with a spoken dialogue in
terface Such an interface will be useful as the
recent appliances become complex with many
features and so are their manuals In the ap
pliances such as VTR Video Tape Recorder
and FAX machines there is not a large screen
to display the list of matched candidates to be
selected by the user Therefore we address a
spoken dialogue strategy to determine the most
appropriate one from the list of candidates
An alternative system design is the use of di
rectory search as adopted in voice portal sys
tems where the documents are hierarchically
structured and the system prompts users to se
lect one of the menu from the top to the leaf
The method is rigid and not userfriendly since
users often have trouble in selection and want
to specify by their own expression The pro
posed system allows users to make queries spon
taneously and makes use of the directory struc
ture in the followup dialogue to determine the
most appropriate one

As a result of the matching many candi
dates are usually found They may include
irrelevant ones because of speech recogni
tion errors But it is not practical to read
out all of them in order with a TTS text
tospeech system Therefore dialogue is
invoked to narrow down to the intended
one This dialogue is restricted to system

 Dialogue Strategy using Structure
of Manual
If one of the candidates is more plausible than
others with a signicant margin we should
make conrmation on it When there are many
candidates with similar condence and they
can be hierarchically grouped into several cate
gories we had better rst identify which cate
gory the intended one belongs to In this work
we make use of the section structure of the man
ual ie section is the rst layer subsection is
the secondlayer and so on The tree structure
is automatically derived from its table of con
tents An example for VTR manual is shown in
Figure 
For each node of the tree likelihood L

j
is
assigned as follows
 For a leaf node the matching score L
j
is
assigned after normalizing so that the sum
over all leaves manual items is 	
 For a nonleaf node the sum of the likeli
hood of its children nodes is assigned
Then a dialogue is generated as follows
