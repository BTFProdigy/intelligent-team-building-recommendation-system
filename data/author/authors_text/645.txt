Abstract
In this paper we present TroFi (Trope
Finder), a system for automatically classi-
fying literal and nonliteral usages of verbs
through nearly unsupervised word-sense
disambiguation and clustering techniques.
TroFi uses sentential context instead of
selectional constraint violations or paths
in semantic hierarchies. It also uses lit-
eral and nonliteral seed sets acquired and
cleaned without human supervision in or-
der to bootstrap learning. We adapt a
word-sense disambiguation algorithm to
our task and augment it with multiple seed
set learners, a voting schema, and addi-
tional features like SuperTags and extra-
sentential context. Detailed experiments
on hand-annotated data show that our en-
hanced algorithm outperforms the base-
line by 24.4%. Using the TroFi algo-
rithm, we also build the TroFi Example
Base, an extensible resource of annotated
literal/nonliteral examples which is freely
available to the NLP research community.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we propose TroFi (Trope Finder),
a nearly unsupervised clustering method for sep-
arating literal and nonliteral usages of verbs. For
example, given the target verb ?pour?, we would
expect TroFi to cluster the sentence ?Custom
demands that cognac be poured from a freshly
opened bottle? as literal, and the sentence ?Salsa
and rap music pour out of the windows? as nonlit-
eral, which, indeed, it does. We call our method
nearly unsupervised. See Section 3.1 for why we
use this terminology.
We reduce the problem of nonliteral language
recognition to one of word-sense disambiguation
?This research was partially supported by NSERC,
Canada (RGPIN: 264905). We would like to thank Bill
Dolan, Fred Popowich, Dan Fass, Katja Markert, Yudong
Liu, and the anonymous reviewers for their comments.
by redefining literal and nonliteral as two differ-
ent senses of the same word, and we adapt an ex-
isting similarity-based word-sense disambiguation
method to the task of separating usages of verbs
into literal and nonliteral clusters. This paper fo-
cuses on the algorithmic enhancements necessary
to facilitate this transformation from word-sense
disambiguation to nonliteral language recognition.
The output of TroFi is an expandable example base
of literal/nonliteral clusters which is freely avail-
able to the research community.
Many systems that use NLP methods ? such as
dialogue systems, paraphrasing and summariza-
tion, language generation, information extraction,
machine translation, etc. ? would benefit from be-
ing able to recognize nonliteral language. Con-
sider an example based on a similar example from
an automated medical claims processing system.
We must determine that the sentence ?she hit the
ceiling? is meant literally before it can be marked
up as an ACCIDENT claim. Note that the typical
use of ?hit the ceiling? stored in a list of idioms
cannot help us. Only using the context, ?She broke
her thumb while she was cheering for the Patriots
and, in her excitement, she hit the ceiling,? can we
decide.
We further motivate the usefulness of the abil-
ity to recognize literal vs. nonliteral usages using
an example from the Recognizing Textual Entail-
ment (RTE-1) challenge of 2005. (This is just an
example; we do not compute entailments.) In the
challenge data, Pair 1959 was: Kerry hit Bush hard
on his conduct on the war in Iraq. ? Kerry shot
Bush. The objective was to report FALSE since
the second statement in this case is not entailed
from the first one. In order to do this, it is cru-
cial to know that ?hit? is being used nonliterally in
the first sentence. Ideally, we would like to look
at TroFi as a first step towards an unsupervised,
scalable, widely applicable approach to nonliteral
language processing that works on real-world data
from any domain in any language.

2 Previous Work
The foundations of TroFi lie in a rich collec-
tion of metaphor and metonymy processing sys-
tems: everything from hand-coded rule-based sys-
tems to statistical systems trained on large cor-
pora. Rule-based systems ? some using a type
of interlingua (Russell, 1976); others using com-
plicated networks and hierarchies often referred
to as metaphor maps (e.g. (Fass, 1997; Martin,
1990; Martin, 1992) ? must be largely hand-coded
and generally work well on an enumerable set
of metaphors or in limited domains. Dictionary-
based systems use existing machine-readable dic-
tionaries and path lengths between words as one
of their primary sources for metaphor processing
information (e.g. (Dolan, 1995)). Corpus-based
systems primarily extract or learn the necessary
metaphor-processing information from large cor-
pora, thus avoiding the need for manual annota-
tion or metaphor-map construction. Examples of
such systems can be found in (Murata et. al., 2000;
Nissim &Markert, 2003; Mason, 2004). The work
on supervised metonymy resolution by Nissim &
Markert and the work on conceptual metaphors by
Mason come closest to what we are trying to do
with TroFi.
Nissim & Markert (2003) approach metonymy
resolution with machine learning methods, ?which
[exploit] the similarity between examples of con-
ventional metonymy? ((Nissim & Markert, 2003),
p. 56). They see metonymy resolution as a classi-
fication problem between the literal use of a word
and a number of pre-defined metonymy types.
They use similarities between possibly metonymic
words (PMWs) and known metonymies as well as
context similarities to classify the PMWs. The
main difference between the Nissim & Markert al-
gorithm and the TroFi algorithm ? besides the fact
that Nissim & Markert deal with specific types
of metonymy and not a generalized category of
nonliteral language ? is that Nissim & Markert
use a supervised machine learning algorithm, as
opposed to the primarily unsupervised algorithm
used by TroFi.
Mason (2004) presents CorMet, ?a corpus-
based system for discovering metaphorical map-
pings between concepts? ((Mason, 2004), p. 23).
His system finds the selectional restrictions of
given verbs in particular domains by statistical
means. It then finds metaphorical mappings be-
tween domains based on these selectional prefer-
ences. By finding semantic differences between
the selectional preferences, it can ?articulate the
higher-order structure of conceptual metaphors?
((Mason, 2004), p. 24), finding mappings like
LIQUID?MONEY. Like CorMet, TroFi uses
contextual evidence taken from a large corpus and
also uses WordNet as a primary knowledge source,
but unlike CorMet, TroFi does not use selectional
preferences.
Metaphor processing has even been ap-
proached with connectionist systems storing
world-knowledge as probabilistic dependencies
(Narayanan, 1999).
3 TroFi
TroFi is not a metaphor processing system. It does
not claim to interpret metonymy and it will not tell
you what a given idiom means. Rather, TroFi at-
tempts to separate literal usages of verbs from non-
literal ones.
For the purposes of this paper we will take the
simplified view that literal is anything that falls
within accepted selectional restrictions (?he was
forced to eat his spinach? vs. ?he was forced to eat
his words?) or our knowledge of the world (?the
sponge absorbed the water? vs. ?the company
absorbed the loss?). Nonliteral is then anything
that is ?not literal?, including most tropes, such as
metaphors, idioms, as well phrasal verbs and other
anomalous expressions that cannot really be seen
as literal. In terms of metonymy, TroFi may clus-
ter a verb used in a metonymic expression such as
?I read Keats? as nonliteral, but we make no strong
claims about this.
3.1 The Data
The TroFi algorithm requires a target set (called
original set in (Karov & Edelman, 1998)) ? the
set of sentences containing the verbs to be classi-
fied into literal or nonliteral ? and the seed sets:
the literal feedback set and the nonliteral feed-
back set. These sets contain feature lists consist-
ing of the stemmed nouns and verbs in a sentence,
with target or seed words and frequent words re-
moved. The frequent word list (374 words) con-
sists of the 332 most frequent words in the British
National Corpus plus contractions, single letters,
and numbers from 0-10. The target set is built us-
ing the ?88-?89 Wall Street Journal Corpus (WSJ)
tagged using the (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) tagger and
the (Bangalore & Joshi, 1999) SuperTagger; the
feedback sets are built using WSJ sentences con-

taining seed words extracted from WordNet and
the databases of known metaphors, idioms, and
expressions (DoKMIE), namely Wayne Magnu-
son English Idioms Sayings & Slang and George
Lakoff?s Conceptual Metaphor List, as well as ex-
ample sentences from these sources. (See Section
4 for the sizes of the target and feedback sets.) One
may ask why we need TroFi if we have databases
like the DoKMIE. The reason is that the DoKMIE
are unlikely to list all possible instances of non-
literal language and because knowing that an ex-
pression can be used nonliterally does not mean
that you can tell when it is being used nonliter-
ally. The target verbs may not, and typically do
not, appear in the feedback sets. In addition, the
feedback sets are noisy and not annotated by any
human, which is why we call TroFi unsupervised.
When we useWordNet as a source of example sen-
tences, or of seed words for pulling sentences out
of the WSJ, for building the literal feedback set,
we cannot tell if the WordNet synsets, or the col-
lected feature sets, are actually literal. We provide
some automatic methods in Section 3.3 to ensure
that the feedback set feature sets that will harm us
in the clustering phase are removed. As a side-
effect, we may fill out sparse nonliteral sets.
In the next section we look at the Core TroFi
algorithm and its use of the above data sources.
3.2 Core Algorithm
Since we are attempting to reduce the problem of
literal/nonliteral recognition to one of word-sense
disambiguation, TroFi makes use of an existing
similarity-based word-sense disambiguation algo-
rithm developed by (Karov & Edelman, 1998),
henceforth KE.
The KE algorithm is based on the principle of
attraction: similarities are calculated between sen-
tences containing the word we wish to disam-
biguate (the target word) and collections of seed
sentences (feedback sets) (see also Section 3.1).
A target set sentence is considered to be at-
tracted to the feedback set containing the sentence
to which it shows the highest similarity. Two sen-
tences are similar if they contain similar words and
two words are similar if they are contained in sim-
ilar sentences. The resulting transitive similarity
allows us to defeat the knowledge acquisition bot-
tleneck ? i.e. the low likelihood of finding all pos-
sible usages of a word in a single corpus. Note
that the KE algorithm concentrates on similarities
in the way sentences use the target literal or non-
literal word, not on similarities in the meanings of
the sentences themselves.
Algorithms 1 and 2 summarize the basic TroFi
version of the KE algorithm. Note that p(w, s) is
the unigram probability of word w in sentence s,
331
Algorithm 2 KE-test: classifying literal/nonliteral
1: For any sentence sx ? S
2: if maxsy s-sim
L(sx, sy) > maxsy s-sim
N (sx, sy)
then
3: tag sx as literal
4: else
5: tag sx as nonliteral
6: end if
normalized by the total number of words in s.
In practice, initializing s-simI0 in line (2) of
Algorithm 1 to 0 and then updating it from
w-sim0 means that each target sentence is still
maximally similar to itself, but we also dis-
cover additional similarities between target sen-
tences. We further enhance the algorithm
by using Sum of Similarities. To implement
this, in Algorithm 2 we change line (2) into:
?
sy s-sim
L(sx, sy) >
?
sy s-sim
N (sx, sy)
Although it is appropriate for fine-grained tasks
like word-sense disambiguation to use the single
highest similarity score in order to minimize noise,
summing across all the similarities of a target set
sentence to the feedback set sentences is more
appropriate for literal/nonliteral clustering, where
the usages could be spread across numerous sen-
tences in the feedback sets. We make another
modification to Algorithm 2 by checking that the
maximum sentence similarity in line (2) is above a
certain threshold for classification. If the similar-
ity is above this threshold, we label a target-word
sentence as literal or nonliteral.
Before continuing, let us look at an example.
The features are shown in bold.
Target Set
1 The girl and her brother grasped their mother?s hand.
2 He thinks he has grasped the essentials of the institute?s
finance philosophies.
3 The president failed to grasp ACTech?s finance quandary.
Literal Feedback Set
L1 The man?s aging mother gripped her husband?s
shoulders tightly.
L2 The child gripped her sister?s hand to cross the road.
L3 The president just doesn?t get the picture, does he?
Nonliteral Feedback Set
N1 After much thought, he finally grasped the idea.
N2 This idea is risky, but it looks like the director of the
institute has comprehended the basic principles behind it.
N3 Mrs. Fipps is having trouble comprehending the legal
straits of the institute.
N4 She had a hand in his fully comprehending the quandary.
The target set consists of sentences from the
corpus containing the target word. The feedback
sets contain sentences from the corpus containing
synonyms of the target word found in WordNet
(literal feedback set) and the DoKMIE (nonliteral
feedback set). The feedback sets also contain ex-
ample sentences provided in the target-word en-
tries of these datasets. TroFi attempts to cluster the
target set sentences into literal and nonliteral by
attracting them to the corresponding feature sets
using Algorithms 1 & 2. Using the basic KE algo-
rithm, target sentence 2 is correctly attracted to the
nonliteral set, and sentences 1 and 3 are equally
attracted to both sets. When we apply our sum of
similarities enhancement, sentence 1 is correctly
attracted to the literal set, but sentence 3 is now in-
correctly attracted to the literal set too. In the fol-
lowing sections we describe some enhancements ?
Learners & Voting, SuperTags, and Context ? that
try to solve the problem of incorrect attractions.
3.3 Cleaning the Feedback Sets
In this section we describe how we clean up the
feedback sets to improve the performance of the
Core algorithm. We also introduce the notion of
Learners & Voting.
Recall that neither the raw data nor the collected
feedback sets are manually annotated for training
purposes. Since, in addition, the feedback sets are
collected automatically, they are very noisy. For
instance, in the example in Section 3.2, the lit-
eral feedback set sentence L3 contains an idiom
which was provided as an example sentence in
WordNet as a synonym for ?grasp?. In N4, we
have the side-effect feature ?hand?, which unfor-
tunately overlaps with the feature ?hand? that we
might hope to find in the literal set (e.g. ?grasp his
hand?). In order to remove sources of false attrac-
tion like these, we introduce the notion of scrub-
bing. Scrubbing is founded on a few basic prin-
ciples. The first is that the contents of the DoK-
MIE come from (third-party) human annotations
and are thus trusted. Consequently we take them
as primary and use them to scrub the WordNet
synsets. The second is that phrasal and expres-
sion verbs, for example ?throw away?, are often
indicative of nonliteral uses of verbs ? i.e. they are
not the sum of their parts ? so they can be used
for scrubbing. The third is that content words ap-
pearing in both feedback sets ? for example ?the
wind is blowing? vs. ?the winds of war are blow-
ing? for the target word ?blow? ? will lead to im-
pure feedback sets, a situation we want to avoid.
The fourth is that our scrubbing action can take a
number of different forms: we can choose to scrub
332
just a word, a whole synset, or even an entire fea-
ture set. In addition, we can either move the of-
fending item to the opposite feedback set or re-
move it altogether. Moving synsets or feature sets
can add valuable content to one feedback set while
removing noise from the other. However, it can
also cause unforeseen contamination. We experi-
mented with a number of these options to produce
a whole complement of feedback set learners for
classifying the target sentences. Ideally this will
allow the different learners to correct each other.
For Learner A, we use phrasal/expression verbs
and overlap as indicators to select whole Word-
Net synsets for moving over to the nonliteral feed-
back set. In our example, this causes L1-L3 to
be moved to the nonliteral set. For Learner B,
we use phrasal/expression verbs and overlap as
indicators to remove problematic synsets. Thus
we avoid accidentally contaminating the nonliteral
set. However, we do end up throwing away infor-
mation that could have been used to pad out sparse
nonliteral sets. In our example, this causes L1-L3
to be dropped. For Learner C, we remove feature
sets from the final literal and nonliteral feedback
sets based on overlapping words. In our exam-
ple, this causes L2 and N4 to be dropped. Learner
D is the baseline ? no scrubbing. We simply use
the basic algorithm. Each learner has benefits and
shortcomings. In order to maximize the former
and minimize the latter, instead of choosing the
single most successful learner, we introduce a vot-
ing system. We use a simple majority-rules algo-
rithm, with the strongest learners weighted more
heavily. In our experiments we double the weights
of Learners A and D. In our example, this results
in sentence 3 now being correctly attracted to the
nonliteral set.
3.4 Additional Features
Even before voting, we attempt to improve the cor-
rectness of initial attractions through the use of
SuperTags, which allows us to add internal struc-
ture information to the bag-of-words feature lists.
SuperTags (Bangalore & Joshi, 1999) encode a
great deal of syntactic information in a single tag
(each tag is an elementary tree from the XTAG
English Tree Adjoining Grammar). In addition
to a word?s part of speech, they also encode in-
formation about its location in a syntactic tree ?
i.e. we learn something about the surrounding
words as well. We devised a SuperTag trigram
composed of the SuperTag of the target word and
the following two words and their SuperTags if
they contain nouns, prepositions, particles, or ad-
verbs. This is helpful in cases where the same
set of features can be used as part of both literal
and nonliteral expressions. For example, turning
?It?s hard to kick a habit like drinking? into ?habit
drink kick/B nx0Vpls1 habit/A NXN,? results in
a higher attraction to sentences about ?kicking
habits? than to sentences like ?She has a habit of
kicking me when she?s been drinking.?
Note that the creation of Learners A and B
changes if SuperTags are used. In the origi-
nal version, we only move or remove synsets
based on phrasal/expression verbs and overlapping
words. If SuperTags are used, we also move or
remove feature sets whose SuperTag trigram indi-
cates phrasal verbs (verb-particle expressions).
A final enhancement involves extending the
context to help with disambiguation. Sometimes
critical disambiguation features are contained not
in the sentence with the target word, but in an
adjacent sentence. To add context, we simply
group the sentence containing the target word with
a specified number of surrounding sentences and
turn the whole group into a single feature set.
4 Results
TroFi was evaluated on the 25 target words listed
in Table 1. The target sets contain from 1 to 115
manually annotated sentences for each verb. The
first round of annotations was done by the first an-
notator. The second annotator was given no in-
structions besides a few examples of literal and
nonliteral usage (not covering all target verbs).
The authors of this paper were the annotators. Our
inter-annotator agreement on the annotations used
as test data in the experiments in this paper is quite
high. ? (Cohen) and ? (S&C) on a random sam-
ple of 200 annotated examples annotated by two
different annotators was found to be 0.77. As per
((Di Eugenio & Glass, 2004), cf. refs therein), the
standard assessment for ? values is that tentative
conclusions on agreement exists when .67 ? ? <
.8, and a definite conclusion on agreement exists
when ? ? .8.
In the case of a larger scale annotation effort,
having the person leading the effort provide one
or two examples of literal and nonliteral usages
for each target verb to each annotator would al-
most certainly improve inter-annotator agreement.
Table 1 lists the total number of target sentences,
plus the manually evaluated literal and nonliteral
333
counts, for each target word. It also provides the
feedback set sizes for each target word. The to-
tals across all words are given at the bottom of the

Table 1: Target and Feedback Set Sizes.
The algorithms were evaluated based on how
accurately they clustered the hand-annotated sen-
tences. Sentences that were attracted to neither
cluster or were equally attracted to both were put
in the opposite set from their label, making a fail-
ure to cluster a sentence an incorrect clustering.
Evaluation results were recorded as recall, pre-
cision, and f-score values. Literal recall is defined
as (correct literals in literal cluster / total correct
literals). Literal precision is defined as (correct
literals in literal cluster / size of literal cluster).
If there are no literals, literal recall is 100%; lit-
eral precision is 100% if there are no nonliterals in
the literal cluster and 0% otherwise. The f-score
is defined as (2 ? precision ? recall) / (precision
+ recall). Nonliteral precision and recall are de-
fined similarly. Average precision is the average
of literal and nonliteral precision; similarly for av-
erage recall. For overall performance, we take the
f-score of average precision and average recall.
We calculated two baselines for each word. The
first was a simple majority-rules baseline. Due to
the imbalance of literal and nonliteral examples,
this baseline ranges from 60.9% to 66.7% with an
average of 63.6%. Keep in mind though that us-
ing this baseline, the f-score for the nonliteral set
will always be 0%. We come back to this point
at the end of this section. We calculated a sec-
ond baseline using a simple attraction algorithm.
Each target set sentence is attracted to the feed-
back set containing the sentence with which it has
the most words in common. This corresponds well
to the basic highest similarity TroFi algorithm.
Sentences attracted to neither, or equally to both,
sets are put in the opposite cluster to where they
belong. Since this baseline actually attempts to
distinguish between literal and nonliteral and uses
all the data used by the TroFi algorithm, it is the
one we will refer to in our discussion below.
Experiments were conducted to first find the
results of the core algorithm and then determine
the effects of each enhancement. The results are
shown in Figure 1. The last column in the graph
shows the average across all the target verbs.
On average, the basic TroFi algorithm (KE)
gives a 7.6% improvement over the baseline, with
some words, like ?lend? and ?touch?, having
higher results due to transitivity of similarity. For
our sum of similarities enhancement, all the in-
dividual target word results except for ?examine?
sit above the baseline. The dip is due to the fact
that while TroFi can generate some beneficial sim-
ilarities between words related by context, it can
also generate some detrimental ones. When we
use sum of similarities, it is possible for the tran-
sitively discovered indirect similarities between a
target nonliteral sentence and all the sentences in a
feedback set to add up to more than a single direct
similarity between the target sentence and a single
feedback set sentence. This is not possible with
highest similarity because a single sentence would
have to show a higher similarity to the target sen-
tence than that produced by sharing an identical
word, which is unlikely since transitively discov-
ered similarities generally do not add up to 1. So,
although highest similarity occasionally produces
better results than using sum of similarities, on av-
erage we can expect to get better results with the
latter. In this experiment alone, we get an average
f-score of 46.3% for the sum of similarities results
? a 9.4% improvement over the high similarity re-
sults (36.9%) and a 16.9% improvement over the
baseline (29.4%).

Figure 1: TroFi Evaluation Results.
In comparing the individual results of all our
learners, we found that the results for Learners A
and D (46.7% and 46.3%) eclipsed Learners B and
C by just over 2.5%. Using majority-rules voting
with Learners A and D doubled, we were able to
obtain an average f-score of 48.4%, showing that
voting does to an extent balance out the learners?
varying results on different words.

ments in some words like ?drag? and ?stick?. The
overall gain was only 0.5%, likely due to an over-
generation of similarities. Future work may iden-
tify ways to use SuperTags more effectively.
The use of additional context was responsible
for our second largest leap in performance after
sum of similarities. We gained 4.9%, bringing
us to an average f-score of 53.8%. Worth noting
is that the target words exhibiting the most sig-
nificant improvement, ?drown? and ?grasp?, had
some of the smallest target and feedback set fea-
ture sets, supporting the theory that adding cogent
features may improve performance.
With an average of 53.8%, all words but one
lie well above our simple-attraction baseline, and
some even achieve much higher results than the
majority-rules baseline. Note also that, using this
latter baseline, TroFi boosts the nonliteral f-score
from 0% to 42.3%.
5 The TroFi Example Base
In this section we discuss the TroFi Example Base.
First, we examine iterative augmentation. Then
we discuss the structure and contents of the exam-
ple base and the potential for expansion.
After an initial run for a particular target word,
we have the cluster results plus a record of the
feedback sets augmented with the newly clustered
sentences. Each feedback set sentence is saved
with a classifier weight, with newly clustered sen-
tences receiving a weight of 1.0. Subsequent runs
may be done to augment the initial clusters. For
these runs, we use the classifiers from our initial
run as feedback sets. New sentences for clustering
are treated like a regular target set. Running TroFi
produces new clusters and re-weighted classifiers
augmented with newly clustered sentences. There
can be as many runs as desired; hence iterative
augmentation.
We used the iterative augmentation process to
build a small example base consisting of the target
words from Table 1, as well as another 25 words
drawn from the examples of scholars whose work

was reviewed in Section 2. It is important to note
that in building the example base, we used TroFi
with an Active Learning component (see (Birke,
2005)) which improved our average f-score from
53.8% to 64.9% on the original 25 target words.
An excerpt from the example base is shown
in Figure 2. Each entry includes an ID num-
ber and a Nonliteral, Literal, or Unannotated
tag. Annotations are from testing or from
active learning during example-base construc-
tion. The TroFi Example Base is available at
http://www.cs.sfu.ca/?anoop/students/jbirke/. Fur-
ther unsupervised expansion of the existing clus-
ters as well as the production of additional clusters
is a possibility.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we presented TroFi, a system for
separating literal and nonliteral usages of verbs
through statistical word-sense disambiguation and
clustering techniques. We suggest that TroFi is
applicable to all sorts of nonliteral language, and
that, although it is currently focused on English
verbs, it could be adapted to other parts of speech
and other languages.
We adapted an existing word-sense disam-
biguation algorithm to literal/nonliteral clustering
through the redefinition of literal and nonliteral as
word senses, the alteration of the similarity scores
used, and the addition of learners and voting, Su-
perTags, and additional context.
For all our models and algorithms, we carried
out detailed experiments on hand-annotated data,
both to fully evaluate the system and to arrive at
an optimal configuration. Through our enhance-
ments we were able to produce results that are, on
average, 16.9% higher than the core algorithm and
24.4% higher than the baseline.
Finally, we used our optimal configuration of
TroFi, together with active learning and iterative
augmentation, to build the TroFi Example Base,
a publicly available, expandable resource of lit-
eral/nonliteral usage clusters that we hope will be
useful not only for future research in the field of
nonliteral language processing, but also as train-
ing data for other statistical NLP tasks.

Abstract
In this paper we present an active learn-
ing approach used to create an annotated
corpus of literal and nonliteral usages
of verbs. The model uses nearly unsu-
pervised word-sense disambiguation and
clustering techniques. We report on exper-
iments in which a human expert is asked
to correct system predictions in different
stages of learning: (i) after the last iter-
ation when the clustering step has con-
verged, or (ii) during each iteration of the
clustering algorithm. The model obtains
an f-score of 53.8% on a dataset in which
literal/nonliteral usages of 25 verbs were
annotated by human experts. In compari-
son, the same model augmented with ac-
tive learning obtains 64.91%. We also
measure the number of examples required
when model confidence is used to select
examples for human correction as com-
pared to random selection. The results of
this active learning system have been com-
piled into a freely available annotated cor-
pus of literal/nonliteral usage of verbs in
context.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we propose a largely automated
method for creating an annotated corpus of literal vs.
nonliteral usages of verbs. For example, given the
verb ?pour?, we would expect our method to iden-
tify the sentence ?Custom demands that cognac be
poured from a freshly opened bottle? as literal, and
the sentence ?Salsa and rap music pour out of the
windows? as nonliteral, which, indeed, it does.
?This research was partially supported by NSERC, Canada
(RGPIN: 264905). We would like to thank Bill Dolan, Fred
Popowich, Dan Fass, Katja Markert, Yudong Liu, and the
anonymous reviewers for their comments.
We reduce the problem of nonliteral language
recognition to one of word-sense disambiguation
(WSD) by redefining literal and nonliteral as two
different senses of the same word, and we adapt
an existing similarity-based word-sense disambigua-
tion method to the task of separating usages of verbs
into literal and nonliteral clusters. Note that treat-
ing this task as similar to WSD only means that
we use features from the local context around the
verb to identify it as either literal or non-literal. It
does not mean that we can use a classifier trained on
WSD annotated corpora to solve this issue, or use
any existing WSD classification technique that re-
lies on supervised learning. We do not have any an-
notated data to train such a classifier, and indeed our
work is focused on building such a dataset. Indeed
our work aims to first discover reliable seed data
and then bootstrap a literal/nonliteral identification
model. Also, we cannot use any semi-supervised
learning algorithm for WSD which relies on reliably
annotated seed data since we do not possess any reli-
ably labeled data (except for our test data set). How-
ever we do exploit a noisy source of seed data in
a nearly unsupervised approach augmented with ac-
tive learning. Noisy data containing example sen-
tences of literal and nonliteral usage of verbs is used
in our model to cluster a particular instance of a verb
into one class or the other. This paper focuses on the
use of active learning using this model. We suggest
that this approach produces a large saving of effort
compared to creating such an annotated corpus man-
ually.
An active learning approach to machine learn-
ing is one in which the learner has the ability to
influence the selection of at least a portion of its
training data. In our approach, a clustering algo-
rithm for literal/nonliteral recognition tries to anno-
tate the examples that it can, while in each iteration
it sends a small set of examples to a human expert
to annotate, which in turn provides additional ben-
efit to the bootstrapping process. Our active learn-
21
ing method is similar to the Uncertainty Sampling
algorithm of (Lewis & Gale, 1994) but in our case
interacts with iterative clustering. As we shall see,
some of the crucial criticisms leveled against un-
certainty sampling and in favor of Committee-based
sampling (Engelson & Dagan, 1996) do not apply in
our case, although the latter may still be more accu-
rate in our task.
2 Literal vs. Nonliteral Identification
For the purposes of this paper we will take the sim-
plified view that literal is anything that falls within
accepted selectional restrictions (?he was forced to
eat his spinach? vs. ?he was forced to eat his words?)
or our knowledge of the world (?the sponge ab-
sorbed the water? vs. ?the company absorbed the
loss?). Nonliteral is then anything that is ?not lit-
eral?, including most tropes, such as metaphors, id-
ioms, as well as phrasal verbs and other anomalous
expressions that cannot really be seen as literal. We
aim to automatically discover the contrast between
the standard set of selectional restrictions for the lit-
eral usage of verbs and the non-standard set which
we assume will identify the nonliteral usage.
Our identification model for literal vs. nonliteral
usage of verbs is described in detail in a previous
publication (Birke & Sarkar, 2006). Here we pro-
vide a brief description of the model so that the use
of this model in our proposed active learning ap-
proach can be explained.
Since we are attempting to reduce the problem
of literal/nonliteral recognition to one of word-sense
disambiguation, we use an existing similarity-based
word-sense disambiguation algorithm developed by
(Karov & Edelman, 1998), henceforth KE. The KE
algorithm is based on the principle of attraction:
similarities are calculated between sentences con-
taining the word we wish to disambiguate (the target
word) and collections of seed sentences (feedback
sets). It requires a target set ? the set of sentences
containing the verbs to be classified into literal or
nonliteral ? and the seed sets: the literal feedback
set and the nonliteral feedback set. A target set sen-
tence is considered to be attracted to the feedback set
containing the sentence to which it shows the highest
similarity. Two sentences are similar if they contain
similar words and two words are similar if they are
contained in similar sentences. The resulting transi-
tive similarity allows us to defeat the knowledge ac-
quisition bottleneck ? i.e. the low likelihood of find-
ing all possible usages of a word in a single corpus.
Note that the KE algorithm concentrates on similari-
ties in the way sentences use the target literal or non-
literal word, not on similarities in the meanings of
the sentences themselves.
Algorithms 1 and 2 summarize our approach.
Note that p(w, s) is the unigram probability of word
w in sentence s, normalized by the total number of
words in s. We omit some details about the algo-
rithm here which do not affect our discussion about
active learning. These details are provided in a pre-
vious publication (Birke & Sarkar, 2006).
As explained before, our model requires a target
set and two seed sets: the literal feedback set and
the nonliteral feedback set. We do not explain the
details of how these feedback sets were constructed
in this paper, however, it is important to note that the
feedback sets themselves are noisy and not carefully
vetted by human experts. The literal feedback set
was built from WSJ newswire text, and for the non-
literal feedback set, we use expressions from vari-
ous datasets such as the Wayne Magnuson English
Idioms Sayings & Slang and George Lakoff?s Con-
ceptual Metaphor List, as well as example sentences
from these sources. These datasets provide lists of
verbs that may be used in a nonliteral usage, but we
cannot explicitly provide only those sentences that
contain nonliteral use of that verb in the nonliteral
feedback set. In particular, knowing that an expres-
sion can be used nonliterally does not mean that you
can tell when it is being used nonliterally. In fact
even the literal feedback set has noise from nonlit-
eral uses of verbs in the news articles. To deal with
this issue (Birke & Sarkar, 2006) provides automatic
methods to clean up the feedback sets during the
clustering algorithm. Note that the feedback sets are
not cleaned up by human experts, however the test
data is carefully annotated by human experts (details
about inter-annotator agreement on the test set are
provided below). The test set is not large enough to
be split up into a training and test set that can support
learning using a supervised learning method.
The sentences in the target set and feedback sets
were augmented with some shallow syntactic in-
formation such as part of speech tags provided

by a statistical tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and Su-
perTags (Bangalore & Joshi, 1999).
This model was evaluated on 25 target verbs:
absorb, assault, die, drag, drown, escape,
examine, fill, fix, flow, grab, grasp, kick,
knock, lend, miss, pass, rest, ride, roll,
smooth, step, stick, strike, touch
The verbs were carefully chosen to have vary-
ing token frequencies (we do not simply learn on
frequently occurring verbs). As a result, the tar-
get sets contain from 1 to 115 manually annotated
sentences for each verb to enable us to measure ac-
curacy. The annotations were not provided to the
learning algorithm: they were only used to evaluate
the test data performance. The first round of anno-
tations was done by the first annotator. The second
annotator was given no instructions besides a few
examples of literal and nonliteral usage (not cov-
ering all target verbs). The authors of this paper
were the annotators. Our inter-annotator agreement
on the annotations used as test data in the experi-
ments in this paper is quite high. ? (Cohen) and ?
(S&C) on a random sample of 200 annotated exam-
ples annotated by two different annotators was found
to be 0.77. As per ((Di Eugenio & Glass, 2004), cf.
refs therein), the standard assessment for ? values is
that tentative conclusions on agreement exists when
.67 ? ? < .8, and a definite conclusion on agree-
ment exists when ? ? .8.
In the case of a larger scale annotation effort, hav-
ing the person leading the effort provide one or two
examples of literal and nonliteral usages for each tar-
get verb to each annotator would almost certainly
improve inter-annotator agreement.
The algorithms were evaluated based on how
accurately they clustered the hand-annotated sen-
tences. Sentences that were attracted to neither clus-
ter or were equally attracted to both were put in the
opposite set from their label, making a failure to
cluster a sentence an incorrect clustering.
Evaluation results were recorded as recall, preci-
sion, and f-score values. Literal recall is defined as
(correct literals in literal cluster / total correct liter-
als). Literal precision is defined as (correct literals
in literal cluster / size of literal cluster). If there are
no literals, literal recall is 100%; literal precision is
100% if there are no nonliterals in the literal clus-
ter and 0% otherwise. The f-score is defined as (2 ?

precision and recall are defined similarly. Average
precision is the average of literal and nonliteral pre-
cision; similarly for average recall. For overall per-
formance, we take the f-score of average precision
and average recall.
We calculated two baselines for each word. The
first was a simple majority-rules baseline (assign
each word to the sense which is dominant which
is always literal in our dataset). Due to the imbal-
ance of literal and nonliteral examples, this baseline
ranges from 60.9% to 66.7% for different verbs with
an average of 63.6%. Keep in mind though that us-
ing this baseline, the f-score for the nonliteral set
will always be 0% ? which is the problem we are
trying to solve in this work. We calculated a second
baseline using a simple attraction algorithm. Each
sentence in the target set is attracted to the feedback
set with which it has the most words in common.
For the baseline and for our own model, sentences
attracted to neither, or equally to both sets are put
in the opposite cluster to which they belong. This
second baseline obtains a f-score of 29.36% while
the weakly supervised model without active learn-
ing obtains an f-score of 53.8%. Results for each
verb are shown in Figure 1.
3 Active Learning
The model described thus far is weakly supervised.
The main proposal in this paper is to push the re-
sults further by adding in an active learning compo-
nent, which puts the model described in Section 2 in
the position of helping a human expert with the lit-
eral/nonliteral clustering task. The two main points
to consider are: what to send to the human annotator,
and when to send it.
We always send sentences from the undecided
cluster ? i.e. those sentences where attraction to
either feedback set, or the absolute difference of
the two attractions, falls below a given threshold.
The number of sentences falling under this threshold
varies considerably from word to word, so we ad-
ditionally impose a predetermined cap on the num-
ber of sentences that can ultimately be sent to the
human. Based on an experiment on a held-out set
separate from our target set of sentences, sending
a maximum of 30% of the original set was deter-
mined to be optimal in terms of eventual accuracy
obtained. We impose an order on the candidate sen-
tences using similarity values. This allows the origi-
nal sentences with the least similarity to either feed-
back set to be sent to the human first. Further, we
alternate positive similarity (or absolute difference)
values and values of zero. Note that sending ex-
amples that score zero to the human may not help
attract new sentences to either of the feedback sets
(since scoring zero means that the sentence was not
attracted to any of the sentences). However, human
help may be the only chance these sentences have to
be clustered at all.
After the human provides an identification for a
particular example we move the sentence not only
into the correct cluster, but also into the correspond-
ing feedback set so that other sentences might be
attracted to this certifiably correctly classified sen-
tence.
The second question is when to send the sentences
to the human. We can send all the examples after
the first iteration, after some intermediate iteration,
distributed across iterations, or at the end. Sending
everything after the first iteration is best for coun-
teracting false attractions before they become en-
trenched and for allowing future iterations to learn
from the human decisions. Risks include sending
sentences to the human before our model has had
a chance to make potentially correct decision about
them, counteracting any saving of effort. (Karov &
Edelman, 1998) state that the results are not likely
to change much after the third iteration and we have
confirmed this independently: similarity values con-
tinue to change until convergence, but cluster al-
legiance tends not to. Sending everything to the
human after the third iteration could therefore en-
tail some of the damage control of sending every-
thing after the first iteration while giving the model
24
a chance to do its best. Another possibility is to
send the sentences in small doses in order to gain
some bootstrapping benefit at each iteration i.e. the
certainty measures will improve with each bit of hu-
man input, so at each iteration more appropriate sen-
tences will be sent to the human. Ideally, this would
produce a compounding of benefits. On the other
hand, it could produce a compounding of risks. A fi-
nal possibility is to wait until the last iteration in the
hope that our model has correctly clustered every-
thing else and those correctly labeled examples do
not need to be examined by the human. This imme-
diately destroys any bootstrapping possibilities for
the current run, although it still provides benefits for
iterative augmentation runs (see Section 4).
A summary of our results in shown in Figure 1.
The last column in the graph shows the average
across all the target verbs. We now discuss the vari-
ous active learning experiments we performed using
our model and a human expert annotator.
3.1 Experiment 1
Experiments were performed to determine the best
time to send up to 30% of the sentences to the human
annotator. Sending everything after the first iteration
produced an average accuracy of 66.8%; sending ev-
erything after the third iteration, 65.2%; sending a
small amount at each iteration, 60.8%; sending ev-
erything after the last iteration, 64.9%. Going just by
the average accuracy, the first iteration option seems
optimal. However, several of the individual word re-
sults fell catastrophically below the baseline, mainly
due to original sentences having been moved into a
feedback set too early, causing false attraction. This
risk was compounded in the distributed case, as pre-
dicted. The third iteration option gave slightly bet-
ter results (0.3%) than the last iteration option, but
since the difference was minor, we opted for the sta-
bility of sending everything after the last iteration.
These results show an improvement of 11.1% over
the model from Section 2. Individual results for each
verb are given in Figure 1.
3.2 Experiment 2
In a second experiment, rather than letting our model
select the sentences to send to the human, we se-
lected them randomly. We found no significant dif-
ference in the results. For the random model to out-
perform the non-random one it would have to select
only sentences that our model would have clustered
incorrectly; to do worse it would have to select only
sentences that our model could have handled on its
own. The likelihood of the random choices coming
exclusively from these two sets is low.
3.3 Experiment 3
Our third experiment considers the effort-savings of
using our literal/nonliteral identification model. The
main question must be whether the 11.1% accuracy
gain of active learning is worth the effort the hu-
man must contribute. In our experiments, the hu-
man annotator is given at most 30% of the sentences
to classify manually. It is expected that the human
will classify these correctly and any additional ac-
curacy gain is contributed by the model. Without
semi-supervised learning, we might expect that if
the human were to manually classify 30% of the sen-
tences chosen at random, he would have 30% of the
sentences classified correctly. However, in order to
be able to compare the human-only scenario to the
active learning scenario, we must find what the av-
erage f-score of the manual process is. The f-score
depends on the distribution of literal and nonliteral
sentences in the original set. For example, in a set
of 100 sentences, if there are exactly 50 of each, and
of the 30 chosen for manual annotation, half come
from the literal set and half come from the nonlit-
eral set, the f-score will be exactly 30%. We could
compare our performance to this, but that would be
unfair to the manual process since the sets on which
we did our evaluation were by no means balanced.
We base a hypothetical scenario on the heavy imbal-
ance often seen in our evaluation sets, and suggest
a situation where 96 of our 100 sentences are literal
and only 4 are nonliteral. If it were to happen that all
4 of the nonliteral sentences were sent to the human,
we would get a very high f-score, due to a perfect
recall score for the nonliteral cluster and a perfect
precision score for the literal cluster. If none of the
four nonliteral sentences were sent to the human, the
scores for the nonliteral cluster would be disastrous.
This situation is purely hypothetical, but should ac-
count for the fact that 30 out of 100 sentences an-

average f-score of 30%: in fact, averaging the re-

in an avarage f-score of nearly 36.9%. This is 23%
higher than the 30% of the balanced case, which is
1.23 times higher. For this reason, we give the hu-
man scores a boost by assuming that whatever the
human annotates in the manual scenario will result
in an f-score that is 1.23 times higher. For our ex-
periment, we take the number of sentences that our
active learning method sent to the human for each
word ? note that this is not always 30% of the to-
tal number of sentences ? and multiply that by 1.23
? to give the human the benefit of the doubt, so to
speak. Still we find that using active learning gives
us an avarage accuracy across all words of 64.9%,
while we get only 21.7% with the manual process.
This means that for the same human effort, using
the weakly supervised classifier produced a three-
fold improvement in accuracy. Looking at this con-
versely, this means that in order to obtain an ac-
curacy of 64.9%, by a purely manual process, the
human would have to classify nearly 53.6% of the
sentences, as opposed to the 17.7% he needs to do
using active learning. This is an effort-savings of
about 35%. To conclude, we claim that our model
combined with active learning is a helpful tool for
a literal/nonliteral clustering project. It can save the
human significant effort while still producing rea-
sonable results.
4 Annotated corpus built using active
learning
In this section we discuss the development of an an-
notated corpus of literal/nonliteral usages of verbs
in context. First, we examine iterative augmenta-
tion. Then we discuss the structure and contents of
the annotated corpus and the potential for expansion.
After an initial run for a particular target word, we
have the cluster results plus a record of the feedback
sets augmented with the newly clustered sentences.

eral/nonliteral usages of verbs in context.
Each feedback set sentence is saved with a weight,
with newly clustered sentences receiving a weight
of 1.0. Subsequent runs may be done to augment
the initial clusters. For these runs, we use the the
output identification over the examples from our ini-
tial run as feedback sets. New sentences for cluster-
ing are treated like a regular target set. Running the
algorithm in this way produces new clusters and a
re-weighted model augmented with newly clustered
sentences. There can be as many runs as desired;
hence iterative augmentation.
We used the iterative augmentation process to
build a small annotated corpus consisting of the tar-
get words from Table 1, as well as another 25 words
drawn from the examples of previously published
work (see Section 5). It is important to note that
in building the annotated corpus, we used the Ac-
tive Learning component as described in this paper,
which improved our average f-score from 53.8% to
64.9% on the original 25 target words, and we ex-
pect also improved performance on the remainder of
the words in the annotated corpus.
An excerpt from the annotated corpus is shown in
Figure 2. Each entry includes an ID number and a
Nonliteral, Literal, or Unannotated tag. Annotations
are from testing or from active learning during anno-
tated corpus construction. The corpus is available at
http://www.cs.sfu.ca/?anoop/students/jbirke/. Fur-
ther unsupervised expansion of the existing clusters
as well as the production of additional clusters is a
possibility.
5 Previous Work
To our knowledge there has not been any previous
work done on taking a model for literal/nonliteral
language and augmenting it with an active learning
approach which allows human expert knowledge to
become part of the learning process.
Our approach to active learning is similar to the
Uncertainty Sampling approach of (Lewis & Gale,
1994) and (Fujii et. al., 1998) in that we pick those
examples that we could not classify due to low con-
fidence in the labeling at a particular point. We
employ a resource-limited version in which only
a small fixed sample is ever annotated by a hu-
man. Some of the criticisms leveled against un-
certainty sampling and in favor of Committee-based
sampling (Engelson & Dagan, 1996) (and see refs
therein) do not apply in our case.
Our similarity measure is based on two views of
sentence- and word-level similarity and hence we
get an estimate of appropriate identification rather
than just correct classification. As a result, by em-
bedding an Uncertainty Sampling active learning
model within a two-view clustering algorithm, we
gain the same advantages as other uncertainty sam-
pling methods obtain when used in bootstrapping
methods (e.g. (Fujii et. al., 1998)). Other machine
learning approaches that derive from optimal exper-
iment design are not appropriate in our case because
we do not yet have a strong predictive (or generative)
model of the literal/nonliteral distinction.
Our machine learning model only does identifi-
cation of verb usage as literal or nonliteral but it
can be seen as a first step towards the use of ma-
chine learning for more sophisticated metaphor and
metonymy processing tasks on larger text corpora.
Rule-based systems ? some using a type of interlin-
gua (Russell, 1976); others using complicated net-
works and hierarchies often referred to as metaphor
maps (e.g. (Fass, 1997; Martin, 1990; Martin, 1992)
? must be largely hand-coded and generally work
well on an enumerable set of metaphors or in lim-
ited domains. Dictionary-based systems use exist-
ing machine-readable dictionaries and path lengths
between words as one of their primary sources
for metaphor processing information (e.g. (Dolan,
1995)). Corpus-based systems primarily extract or
learn the necessary metaphor-processing informa-
tion from large corpora, thus avoiding the need for
manual annotation or metaphor-map construction.
Examples of such systems are (Murata et. al., 2000;
Nissim & Markert, 2003; Mason, 2004).
27
Nissim & Markert (2003) approach metonymy
resolution with machine learning methods, ?which
[exploit] the similarity between examples of con-
ventional metonymy? ((Nissim & Markert, 2003),
p. 56). They see metonymy resolution as a classi-
fication problem between the literal use of a word
and a number of pre-defined metonymy types. They
use similarities between possibly metonymic words
(PMWs) and known metonymies as well as context
similarities to classify the PMWs.
Mason (2004) presents CorMet, ?a corpus-based
system for discovering metaphorical mappings be-
tween concepts? ((Mason, 2004), p. 23). His system
finds the selectional restrictions of given verbs in
particular domains by statistical means. It then finds
metaphorical mappings between domains based on
these selectional preferences. By finding seman-
tic differences between the selectional preferences,
it can ?articulate the higher-order structure of con-
ceptual metaphors? ((Mason, 2004), p. 24), finding
mappings like LIQUID?MONEY.
Metaphor processing has even been ap-
proached with connectionist systems storing
world-knowledge as probabilistic dependencies
(Narayanan, 1999).
6 Conclusion
In this paper we presented a system for separating
literal and nonliteral usages of verbs through statis-
tical word-sense disambiguation and clustering tech-
niques. We used active learning to combine the pre-
dictions of this system with a human expert anno-
tator in order to boost the overall accuracy of the
system by 11.1%. We used the model together with
active learning and iterative augmentation, to build
an annotated corpus which is publicly available, and
is a resource of literal/nonliteral usage clusters that
we hope will be useful not only for future research in
the field of nonliteral language processing, but also
as training data for other statistical NLP tasks.
