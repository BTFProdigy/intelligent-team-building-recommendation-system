Abstract 
In the construction of a part-of-speech an-
notated corpus, we are constrained by a 
fixed budget. A fully annotated corpus is 
required, but we can afford to label only a 
subset. We train a Maximum Entropy Mar-
kov Model tagger from a labeled subset 
and automatically tag the remainder. This 
paper addresses the question of where to 
focus our manual tagging efforts in order to 
deliver an annotation of highest quality. In 
this context, we find that active learning is 
always helpful. We focus on Query by Un-
certainty (QBU) and Query by Committee 
(QBC) and report on experiments with sev-
eral baselines and new variations of QBC 
and QBU, inspired by weaknesses particu-
lar to their use in this application. Experi-
ments on English prose and poetry test 
these approaches and evaluate their robust-
ness. The results allow us to make recom-
mendations for both types of text and raise 
questions that will lead to further inquiry. 
1 Introduction 
We are operating (as many do) on a fixed budget 
and need annotated text in the context of a larger 
project. We need a fully annotated corpus but can 
afford to annotate only a subset. To address our 
budgetary constraint, we train a model from a ma-
nually annotated subset of the corpus and automat-
ically annotate the remainder. At issue is where to 
focus manual annotation efforts in order to produce 
a complete annotation of highest possible quality. 
A follow-up question is whether these techniques 
work equally well on different types of text. 
In particular, we require part-of-speech (POS) 
annotations. In this paper we employ a state-of-the-
art tagger on both prose and poetry, and we ex-
amine multiple known and novel active learning 
(or sampling) techniques in order to determine 
which work best in this context. We show that the 
results obtained by a state-of-the-art tagger trained 
on a small portion of the data selected through ac-
tive learning can approach the accuracy attained by 
human annotators and are on par with results from 
exhaustively trained automatic taggers. 
In a study based on English language data pre-
sented here, we identify several active learning 
techniques and make several recommendations that 
we hope will be portable for application to other 
text types and to other languages. In section 2 we 
briefly review the state of the art approach to POS 
tagging. In section 3, we survey the approaches to 
active learning employed in this study, including 
variations on commonly known techniques. Sec-
tion 4 introduces the experimental regime and 
presents results and their implications. Section 5 
draws conclusions and identifies opportunities for 
follow-up research. 
2 Part of Speech Tagging 
Labeling natural language data with part-of-speech 
tags can be a complicated task, requiring much 
effort and expense, even for trained annotators. 
Several efforts, notably the Alembic workbench 
(Day et al, 1997) and similar tools, have provided 
interfaces to aid annotators in the process.  
Automatic POS tagging of text using probabilis-
tic models is mostly a solved problem but requires 
supervised learning from substantial amounts of 
training data. Previous work demonstrates the sui-
tability of Hidden Markov Models for POS tagging 
(Kupiec, 1992; Brants, 2000). More recent work 
has achieved state-of-the-art results with Maxi-
101
mum entropy conditional Markov models (MaxEnt 
CMMs, or MEMMs for short) (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; 
Toutanova & Manning, 2000; Toutanova et al, 
2003). Part of the success of MEMMs can be attri-
buted to the absence of independence assumptions 
among predictive features and the resulting ease of 
feature engineering. To the best of our knowledge, 
the present work is the first to present results using 
MEMMs in an active learning framework.  
An MEMM is a probabilistic model for se-
quence labeling. It is a Conditional Markov Model 
(CMM as illustrated in Figure 1) in which a Max-
imum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier is employed to 
estimate the probability distribution
1.. 1 1 2( | , ) ( | , , , )i i ME i i i i ip t w t p t w f t t? ? ?? over 
possible labels it  for each element in the se-
quence?in our case, for each word iw  in a sen-
tence w . The MaxEnt model is trained from la-
beled data and has access to any predefined 
attributes (represented here by the collection if ) of 
the entire word sequence and to the labels of pre-
vious words ( 1.. 1it ? ). Our implementation employs 
an order-two Markov assumption so the classifier 
has access only to the two previous tags 1 2,i it t? ? . 
We refer to the features 1 2( , , , )i i i iw f t t? ? from 
which the classifier predicts the distribution over 
tags as ?the local trigram context?. 
A Viterbi decoder is a dynamic programming 
algorithm that applies the MaxEnt classifier to 
score multiple competing tag-sequence hypotheses 
efficiently and to produce the best tag sequence, 
according to the model. We approximate Viterbi 
very closely using a fast beam search. Essentially, 
the decoding process involves sequential classifi-
cation, conditioned on the (uncertain) decisions of 
the previous local trigram context classifications. 
The chosen tag sequence t? is the tag sequence 
maximizing the following quantity: 
1 2

arg max ( | , , , )
t
t ME i i i i i
i n
t P t w
p t w f t t? ?
=
=
= ?  
The features used in this work are reasonably 
typical for modern MEMM feature-based POS 
tagging and consist of a combination of lexical, 
orthographic, contextual, and frequency-based in-
formation. In particular, for each word the follow-
ing features are defined: the textual form of the 
word itself, the POS tags of the preceding two 
words, and the textual form of the following word. 
Following Toutanova and Manning (2000) approx-
imately, more information is defined for words that 
are considered rare (which we define here as words 
that occur fewer than fifteen times). We consider 
the tagger to be near-state-of-the-art in terms of 
tagging accuracy.

the i-th hidden label (or tag). 
3 Active Learning 
The objective of this research is to produce more 
high quality annotated data with less human anno-
tator time and effort. Active learning is an ap-
proach to machine learning in which a model is 
trained with the selective help of an oracle. The 
oracle provides labels on a sufficient number of 
?tough? cases, as identified by the model. Easy 
cases are assumed to be understood by the model 
and to require no additional annotation by the 
oracle. Many variations have been proposed in the 
broader active learning and decision theory litera-
ture under many names, including ?active sam-
pling? and ?optimal sampling.? 
In active learning for POS tagging, as in other 
applications, the oracle can be a human. For expe-
rimental purposes, a human oracle is simulated 
using pre-labeled data, where the labels are hidden 
until queried. To begin, the active learning process 
requires some small amount of training data to 
seed the model. The process proceeds by identify-
ing the data in the given corpus that should be 
tagged first for maximal impact. 
3.1 Active Learning in the Language Context 
When considering the role of active learning, we 
were initially drawn to the work in active learning 
for classification. In a simple configuration, each 
instance (document, image, etc.) to be labeled can 
be considered to be independent. However, for ac-
tive learning for the POS tagging problem we con-
sidered the nature of human input as an oracle for 
the task. As an approximation, people read sen-
tences as propositional atoms, gathering contextual 
cues from the sentence in order to assemble the 
102
meaning of the whole. Consequently, we thought it 
unreasonable to choose the word as the granularity 
for active learning. Instead, we begin with the as-
sumption that a human will usually require much 
of the sentence or at least local context from the 
sentence in order to label a single word with its 
POS label. While focusing on a single word, the 
human may as well label the entire sentence or at 
least correct the labels assigned by the tagger for 
the sentence. Consequently, the sentence is the 
granularity of annotation for this work. (Future 
work will question this assumption and investigate 
tagging a word or a subsequence of words at a 
time.) This distinguishes our work from active 
learning for classification since labels are not 
drawn from a fixed set of labels. Rather, every sen-
tence of length n can be labeled with a tag se-
quence drawn from a set of size nT , where T  is 
the size of the per-word tag set. Granted, many of 
the options have very low probability. 
To underscore our choice of annotating at the 
granularity of a sentence, we also note that a max-
imum entropy classifier for isolated word tagging 
that leverages attributes of neighboring words?
but is blind to all tags?will underperform an 
MEMM that includes the tags of neighboring 
words (usually on the left) among its features. Pre-
vious experiments demonstrate the usefulness of 
tags in context on the standard Wall Street Journal 
data from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1999). 
A MaxEnt isolated word tagger achieves 93.7% on 
words observed in the training set and 82.6% on 
words unseen in the training set. Toutanova and 
Manning (2000) achieves 96.9% (on seen) and 
86.9% (on unseen) with an MEMM. They sur-
passed their earlier work in 2003 with a ?cyclic 
dependency network tagger?, achieving 
97.2%/89.05% (seen/unseen) (Toutanova et al, 
2003). The generally agreed upon upper bound is 
around 98%, due to label inconsistencies in the 
Treebank. The main point is that effective use of 
contextual features is necessary to achieve state of 
the art performance in POS tagging. 
In active learning, we employ several sets of 
data that we refer to by the following names: 
? Initial Training: the small set of data used 
to train the original model before active 
learning starts 
? Training: data that has already been la-
beled by the oracle as of step i in the learn-
ing cycle 
? Unannotated: data not yet labeled by the 
oracle as of step i 
? Test (specifically Development Test): la-
beled data used to measure the accuracy of 
the model at each stage of the active learn-
ing process. Labels on this set are held in 
reserve for comparison with the labels 
chosen by the model. It is the accuracy on 
this set that we report in our experimental 
results in Section 4. 
Note that the Training set grows at the expense of 
the Unannotated set as active learning progresses. 
Active Learning for POS Tagging consists of the 
following steps: 
1. Train a model with Initial Training data 
2. Apply model to Unannotated data 
3. Compute potential informativeness of 
each sentence 
4. Remove top n sentences with most po-
tential informativeness from Unanno-
tated data and give to oracle 
5. Add n sentences annotated (or corrected) 
by the oracle to Training data 
6. Retrain model with Training data 
7. Return to step 2 until stopping condition 
is met. 
There are several possible stopping conditions, 
including reaching a quality bar based on accuracy 
on the Test set, the rate of oracle error corrections 
in the given cycle, or even the cumulative number 
of oracle error corrections. In practice, the exhaus-
tion of resources, such as time or money, may 
completely dominate all other desirable stopping 
conditions. 
Several methods are available for determining 
which sentences will provide the most information. 
Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI) 
(Raiffa & Schlaiffer, 1967) would be the optimal 
approach from a decision theoretic point of view, 
but it is computationally prohibitive and is not con-
sidered here. We also do not consider the related 
notion of query-by-model-improvement or other 
methods (Anderson & Moore, 2005; Roy & 
McCallum, 2001a, 2001b). While worth exploring, 
they do not fit in the context of this current work 
and should be considered in future work. We focus 
here on the more widely used Query by Committee 
(QBC) and Query by Uncertainty (QBU), includ-
ing our new adaptations of these. 
Our implementation of maximum entropy train-
ing employs a convex optimization procedure 
known as LBFGS. Although this procedure is rela-
tively fast, training a model (or models in the case 
103
of QBC) from scratch on the training data during 
every round of the active learning loop would pro-
long our experiments unnecessarily. Instead we 
start each optimization search with a parameter set 
consisting of the model parameters from the pre-
vious iteration of active learning (we call this ?Fast 
MaxEnt?). In practice, this converges quickly and 
produces equivalent results. 
3.2 Query by Committee 
Query by Committee (QBC) was introduced by 
Seung, Opper, and Sompolinsky (1992). Freund, 
Seung, Shamir, and Tishby (1997) provided a care-
ful analysis of the approach. Engelson and Dagan 
(1996) experimented with QBC using HMMs for 
POS tagging and found that selective sampling of 
sentences can significantly reduce the number of 
samples required to achieve desirable tag accura-
cies. Unlike the present work, Engelson & Dagan 
were restricted by computational resources to se-
lection from small windows of the Unannotated set, 
not from the entire Unannotated set. Related work 
includes learning ensembles of POS taggers, as in 
the work of Brill and Wu (1998), where an ensem-
ble consisting of a unigram model, an N-gram 
model, a transformation-based model, and an 
MEMM for POS tagging achieves substantial re-
sults beyond the individual taggers. Their conclu-
sion relevant to this paper is that different taggers 
commit complementary errors, a useful fact to ex-
ploit in active learning. QBC employs a committee 
of N models, in which each model votes on the 
correct tagging of a sentence. The potential infor-
mativeness of a sentence is measured by the total 
number of tag sequence disagreements (compared 
pair-wise) among the committee members. Possi-
ble variants of QBC involve the number of com-
mittee members, how the training data is split 
among the committee members, and whether the 
training data is sampled with or without replace-
ment. 
A potential problem with QBC in this applica-
tion is that words occur with different frequencies 
in the corpus. Because of the potential for greater 
impact across the corpus, querying for the tag of a 
more frequent word may be more desirable than 
querying for the tag of a word that occurs less fre-
quently, even if there is greater disagreement on 
the tags for the less frequent word. We attempted 
to compensate for this by weighting the number of 
disagreements by the corpus frequency of the word 
in the full data set (Training and Unannotated). 
Unfortunately, this resulted in worse performance; 
solving this problem is an interesting avenue for 
future work. 
3.3 Query by Uncertainty 
The idea behind active sampling based on uncer-
tainty appears to originate with Thrun and Moeller 
(1992). QBU has received significant attention in 
general. Early experiments involving QBU were 
conducted by Lewis and Gale (1994) on text classi-
fication, where they demonstrated significant bene-
fits of the approach. Lewis and Catlett (1994) ex-
amined its application for non-probabilistic learn-
ers in conjunction with other probabilistic learners 
under the name ?uncertainty sampling.? Brigham 
Anderson (2005) explored QBU using HMMs and 
concluded that it is sometimes advantageous. We 
are not aware of any published work on the appli-
cation of QBU to POS tagging. In our implementa-
tion, QBU employs a single MEMM tagger. The 
MaxEnt model comprising the tagger can assess 
the probability distribution over tags for any word 
in its local trigram context, as illustrated in the ex-
ample in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Distribution over tags for the word ?hurdle? in 
italics. The local trigram context is in boldface. 
In Query by Uncertainty (QBU), the informa-
tiveness of a sample is assumed to be the uncer-
tainty in the predicted distribution over tags for 
that sample, that is the entropy of 
1 2( | , , , )ME i i i i ip t w f t t? ? . To determine the poten-
tial informativeness of a word, we can measure the 
entropy in that distribution. Since we are selecting 
sentences, we must extend our measure of uncer-
tainty beyond the word. 
3.4 Adaptations of QBU 
There are several problems with the use of QBU in 
this context: 
? Some words are more important; i.e., they 
contain more information perhaps because 
they occur more frequently. 
   NN 0 .85 
   VB  0.13 
   ... 
RB    DT JJS CD  2.0E-7 
 
Perhaps     the biggest   hurdle ? 
104
? MaxEnt estimates per-word distributions 
over tags, not per-sentence distributions 
over tag sequences. 
? Entropy computations are relatively costly. 
We address the first issue in a new version of QBU 
which we call ?Weighted Query by Uncertainty? 
(WQBU). In WQBU, per-word uncertainty is 
weighted by the word's corpus frequency. 
To address the issue of estimating per-sentence 
uncertainty from distributions over tag sequences, 
we have considered several different approaches. 
The per-word (conditional) entropy is defined as 
follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where iT  is the random variable for the tag it  on 
word iw , and the features of the context in which 
iw  occurs are denoted, as before, by the collection 
if  and the prior tags 1 2,i it t? ? . It is straightforward 
to calculate this entropy for each word in a sen-
tence from the Unannotated set, if we assume that 
previous tags 1 2,i it t? ?  are from the Viterbi (best) 
tag sequence (for the entire sentence) according to 
the model. 
For an entire sentence, we estimate the tag-
sequence entropy by summing over all possible tag 
sequences. However, computing this estimate ex-
actly on a 25-word sentence, where each word can 
be labeled with one of 35 tags, would require 3525 
= 3.99*1038 steps. Instead, we approximate the per-
sentence tag sequence distribution entropy by 
summing per-word entropy: 
 
 
This is the approach we refer to as QBU in the 
experimental results section. We have experi-
mented with a second approach that estimates the 
per-sentence entropy of the tag-sequence distribu-
tion by Monte Carlo decoding. Unfortunately, cur-
rent active learning results involving this MC POS 
tagging decoder are negative on small Training set 
sizes, so we do not present them here. Another al-
ternative approximation worth pursuing is compu-
ting the per-sentence entropy using the n-best POS 
tag sequences. Very recent work by Mann and 
McCallum (2007) proposes an approach in which 
exact sequence entropy can be calculated efficient-
ly. Further experimentation is required to compare 
our approximation to these alternatives. 
An alternative approach that eliminates the 
overhead of entropy computations entirely is to 
estimate per-sentence uncertainty with ?1 ( )P t? , 
where t? is the Viterbi (best) tag sequence. We call 
this scheme QBUV. In essence, it selects a sample 
consisting of the sentences having the highest 
probability that the Viterbi sequence is wrong. To 
our knowledge, this is a novel approach to active 
learning. 
4 Experimental Results 
In this section, we examine the experimental setup, 
the prose and poetry data sets, and the results from 
using the various active learning algorithms on 
these corpora. 
4.1 Setup 
The experiments focus on the annotation scenario 
posed earlier, in which budgetary constraints af-
ford only some number x of sentences to be anno-
tated. The x-axis in each graph captures the num-
ber of sentences. For most of the experiments, the 
graphs present accuracies on the (Development) 
Test set. Later in this section, we present results for 
an alternate metric, namely number of words cor-
rected by the oracle. 
In order to ascertain the usefulness of the active 
learning approaches explored here, the results are 
presented against a baseline in which sentences are 
selected randomly from the Unannotated set. We 
consider this baseline to represent the use of a 
state-of-the-art tagger trained on the same amount 
of data as the active learner. Due to randomization, 
the random baseline is actually distinct from expe-
riment to experiment without any surprising devia-
tions. Also, each result curve in each graph 
represents the average of three distinct runs. 
Worth noting is that most of the graphs include 
active learning curves that are run to completion; 
namely, the rightmost extent of all curves 
represents the exhaustion of the Unannotated data. 
At this extreme point, active learning and random 
sample selection all have the same Training set. In 
the scenarios we are targeting, this far right side is 
not of interest. Points representing smaller amounts 
of annotated data are our primary interest. 
In the experiments that follow, we address sev-
eral natural questions that arise in the course of 
applying active learning. We also compare the va-

riants of QBU and QBC. For QBC, committee 
members divide the training set (at each stage of 
the active learning process) evenly. All committee 
members and final models are MEMMs. Likewise, 
all variants of QBU employ MEMMs. 
4.2 Data Sets 
The experiments involve two data sets in search 
of conclusions that generalize over two very dif-
ferent kinds of English text. The first data set con-
sists of English prose from the POS-tagged one-
million-word Wall Street Journal text in the Penn 
Treebank (PTB) version 3. We use a random sam-
ple of the corpus constituting 25% of the tradition-
al training set (sections 2?21). Initial Training data 
consists of 1% of this set. We employ section 24 as 
the Development Test set. Average sentence length 
is approximately 25 words. 
Our second experimental set consists of English 
poetry from the British National Corpus (BNC) 
(Godbert & Ramsay, 1991; Hughes, 1982; Raine, 
1984). The text is also fully tagged with 91 parts of 
speech from a different tag set than the one used 
for the PTB. The BNC XML data was taken from 
the files B1C.xml, CBO.xml, and H8R.xml. This 
results in a set of 60,056 words and 8,917 sen-
tences. 
4.3 General Results 
To begin, each step in the active learning process 
adds a batch of 100 sentences from the Unanno-
tated set at a time. Figure 3 demonstrates (using 
QBU) that the size of a query batch is not signifi-
cant in these experiments.  
The primary question to address is whether ac-
tive learning helps or not. Figure 4 demonstrates 
that QBU, QBUV, and QBC all outperform the 
random baseline in terms of total, per-word accu-
racy on the Test set, given the same amount of 
Training data. Figure 5 is a close-up version of 
Figure 4, placing emphasis on points up to 1000 
annotated sentences. In these figures, QBU and 
QBUV vie for the best performing active learning 
algorithm. These results appear to give some useful 
advice captured in Table 1. The first column in the 
table contains the starting conditions. The remain-
ing columns indicate that for between 800-1600 
sentences of annotation, QBUV takes over from 
QBU as the best selection algorithm. 
The next question to address is how much initial 
training data should be used; i.e., when should we 
start using active learning? The experiment in Fig-
ure 6 demonstrates (using QBU) that one should 
use as little data as possible for Initial Training 
Data. There is always a significant advantage to 
starting early. In the experiment documented in  
 
Figure 3. Varying the size of the query batch in active 
learning yields identical results after the first query batch.  
 
Figure 4. The best representatives of each type of active 
learner beat the baseline. QBU and QBUV trade off the 
top position over QBC and the Baseline.

4. QBUV and QBU are nearly tied for best performance.

in order to make the point as clearly as possible. 
Larger batch query sizes produce a graph with sim-
ilar trends as do experiments involving larger Un-
annotated sets and other active learners.

4.4 QBC Results 
An important question to address for QBC is 
what number of committee members produces the 
best results? There was no significant difference in 
results from the QBC experiments when using be-
tween 3 and 7 committee members. For brevity we 
omit the graph. 
4.5 QBU Results 
For Query by Uncertainty, the experiment in Fig-
ure 7 demonstrates that QBU is superior to QBUV 
for low counts, but that QBUV slightly overtakes 
QBU beyond approximately 300 sentences. In fact, 
all QBU variants, including the weighted version, 
surpassed the baseline. WQBU has been omitted 
from the graph, as it was inferior to straight-
forward QBU. 
4.6 Results on the BNC 
Next we introduce results on poetry from the Brit-
ish National Corpus. Recall that the feature set 
employed by the MEMM tagger was optimized for 
performance on the Wall Street Journal. For the 
experiment presented in Figure 8, all data in the 
Training and Unannotated sets is from the BNC, 
but we employ the same feature set from the WSJ 
experiments. This result on the BNC data shows 
first of all that tagging poetry with this tagger 
leaves a final shortfall of approximately 8% from 
the WSJ results. Nonetheless and more importantly, 
the active learning trends observed on the WSJ still 
hold. QBC is better than the baseline, and QBU 
and QBUV trade off for first place. Furthermore, 
for low numbers of sentences, it is overwhelmingly 
to one?s advantage to employ active learning for 
annotation.

4.7 Another Perspective 
Next, briefly consider a different metric on the ver-
tical axis. In Figure 9, the metric is the total num-
ber of words changed (corrected) by the oracle. 
This quantity reflects the cumulative number of 
differences between the tagger?s hypothesis on a 
sentence (at the point in time when the oracle is 
queried) and the oracle?s answer (over the training 
set). It corresponds roughly to the amount of time 
that would be required for a human annotator to 
correct the tags suggested by the model. This fig-
ure reveals that QBUV makes significantly more 
changes than QBU, QBC, or LS (the Longest Sen-
tence baseline). Hence, the superiority of QBU 
over QBUV, as measured by this metric, appears to 
outweigh the small wins provided by QBUV when 
measured by accuracy alone. That said, the random 
baseline makes the fewest changes of all. If this 
metric (and not some combination with accuracy) 
were our only consideration, then active learning 
would appear not to serve our needs. 
This metric is also a measure of how well a par-
ticular query algorithm selects sentences that espe-
cially require assistance from the oracle. In this 
sense, QBUV appears most effective. 
 
Figure 9. Cumulative number of corrections made by the 
oracle for several competitive active learning algorithms. 
QBU requires fewer corrections than QBUV. 
5 Conclusions 
Active learning is a viable way to accelerate the 
efficiency of a human annotator and is most effec-
tive when done as early as possible. We have pre-
sented state-of-the-art tagging results using a frac-
tion of the labeled data. QBUV is a cheap approach 
to performing active learning, only to be surpassed 
by QBU when labeling small numbers of sentences. 
We are in the midst of conducting a user study to 
assess the true costs of annotating a sentence at a 
time or a word at a time. We plan to incorporate 
these specific costs into a model of cost measured 
in time (or money) that will supplant the metrics 
reported here, namely accuracy and number of 
words corrected. As noted earlier, future work will 
also evaluate active learning at the granularity of a 
word or a subsequence of words, to be evaluated 
by the cost metric.

Abstract
We define a probabilistic morphological ana-
lyzer using a data-driven approach for Syriac in
order to facilitate the creation of an annotated
corpus. Syriac is an under-resourced Semitic
language for which there are no available lan-
guage tools such as morphological analyzers.
We introduce novel probabilistic models for
segmentation, dictionary linkage, and morpho-
logical tagging and connect them in a pipeline
to create a probabilistic morphological analyzer
requiring only labeled data. We explore the per-
formance of models with varying amounts of
training data and find that with about 34,500
labeled tokens, we can outperform a reason-
able baseline trained on over 99,000 tokens and
achieve an accuracy of just over 80%. When
trained on all available training data, our joint
model achieves 86.47% accuracy, a 29.7% re-
duction in error rate over the baseline.
1 Introduction
Our objective is to facilitate the annotation of a large
corpus of classical Syriac (referred to simply as ?Syr-
iac? throughout the remainder of this work). Syr-
iac is an under-resourced Western Semitic language
of the Christian Near East and a dialect of Aramaic.
It is currently employed almost entirely as a liturgi-
cal language but was a true spoken language up un-
til the eighth century, during which time many pro-
lific authors wrote in Syriac. Even today there are
texts still being composed in or translated into Syr-
iac. By automatically annotating these texts with lin-
guistically useful information, we will facilitate sys-
tematic study by scholars of Syriac, the Near East,
and Eastern Christianity. Furthermore, languages
that are linguistically similar to Syriac (e.g., Arabic
and Hebrew) may benefit from the methodology pre-
sented here.
Our desired annotations include morphological
segmentation, links to dictionary entries, and mor-
phological attributes. Typically, annotations of this
kind are made with the assistance of language tools,
such as morphological analyzers, segmenters, or
part-of-speech (POS) taggers. Such tools do not
exist for Syriac, but some labeled data does exist:
Kiraz (1994) compiled an annotated version of the
Peshitta New Testament (1920) and a concordance
thereof. We aim to replicate this kind of annota-
tion on a much larger scale with more modern tools,
building up from the labeled New Testament data,
our only resource. Motivated by this state of affairs,
our learning and annotation framework requires only
labeled data.
We approach the problem of Syriac morphological
annotation by creating five probabilistic sub-models
that can be trained in a supervised fashion and com-
bined in a joint model of morphological annota-
tion. We introduce novel algorithms for segmenta-
tion, dictionary linkage, and morphological tagging.
We then combine these sub-models into a joint n-
best pipeline. This joint model outperforms a strong,
though na?ve, baseline for all amounts of training
data over about 9,900 word tokens.
1.1 Syriac Background
Since Syriac is an abjad, its writing system does
not require vowels. As a dialect of Aramaic, it
is an inflected language with a templatic (non-
concatenative) morphology, based on a system of
triliteral consonantal roots, with prefixes, suffixes,
infixes, and enclitic particles. Syriac is written from
810
right to left. For the purposes of this work, all Syr-
iac is transliterated according to the Kiraz (1994)
transliteration1 and is written left-to-right whenever
transliterated; the Syriac appearing in the Serto script
in this paper is shown right-to-left.
Since there is no standardized nomenclature for
the parts of a Syriac word, we define the following
terms to facilitate the definitions of segmentation,
dictionary linkage, and morphological tagging:
? word token - contiguous characters delimited by
whitespace and/or punctuation
? stem - an inflected form of the baseform and
the main part of the word to which prefixes and
suffixes can be attached; the affixes do not in-
flect the stem but include prepositions, object
suffixes, and enclitic pronouns
? baseform - the dictionary citation form; also
known as a lexeme or lemma
? root - the form from which the baseform is de-
rived
To clarify, we will use an example word token
???????, LMLCCON, which means ?to your (mas-
culine plural) king?. For this word, the stem is ???,
MLC; the baseform is ????, MLCA ?king?; and the
root is ???,MLC. To clarify, note that the word token
(including the stem) can be spoken and written with
vowels as diacritics; however, since the vowels are
not written in common practice and since most text
does not include them, this work omits any indica-
tion of vowels. Furthermore, the stem is an inflected
baseform and does not necessarily form a word on
its own. Also, the (unvocalized) stem and root are
not necessarily identical. In Syriac, the same root
???, MLC is the foundation for other words such as
promise, counsel, deliberate, reign, queen, kingdom,
and realm.
1.2 Sub-tasks
Segmentation, or tokenization as it is sometimes
called (e.g., Habash and Rambow, 2007), is the pro-
cess of dividing a word token into its prefix(es) (if
any), a stem, and a suffix (if any). For Syriac, each
1According to this transliteration all capital letters including
A (?, olaph) and O (?, waw) are consonants. Additionally, the
semi-colon (;), representing (?, yod), is also a consonant.
word token consists of exactly one stem, from zero
to three prefixes, and zero or one suffix. Each pre-
fix is exactly one character in length. Segmenta-
tion does not include the process of parsing the stem
for its inflectional morphology; that step is handled
separately in subsequent processes described below.
While segmenting a Syriac word, we can handle all
prefixes as a single unit. It is trivial to segment a
prefix cluster into its individual prefixes (one charac-
ter per prefix). Suffixes may be multiple characters
in length and encode the morphological attributes of
the suffix itself (not of the stem); the suffix usually
encodes the object of the stem and has its own gram-
matical attributes, which we list later. As an example
of token segmentation, for the word token ???????,
LMLCCON, the prefix is ?, L ?to?, the stem is ???,
MLC ?king?, and the suffix is ???, CON ?(masculine
plural) your?.
Dictionary linkage is the process of linking a stem
to its associated baseform and root. In most Syriac
dictionaries, all headwords are either baseforms or
roots, and for a given word these are the only rele-
vant entries in the dictionary. Each Syriac stem is
derived from a baseform, and each baseform is de-
rived from a root. There is ambiguity in this cor-
respondence which can be caused by, among other
things, homographic stems generated from different
roots or even from homographic roots. As such, link-
age may be thought of as two separate processes: (1)
baseform linkage, where the stem is mapped to its
most likely baseform; and (2) root linkage, where
the baseform is mapped to its most likely root. For
our example ???????, LMLCCON, baseform linkage
would map stem ???,MLC to baseform ????,MLCA,
and root linkage would map baseform ????,MLCA to
root ???, MLC.
Morphological tagging is the process of labeling
each word token with its morphological attributes.
Morphological tagging may be thought of as two
separate tagging tasks: (1) tagging the stem and (2)
tagging the suffix. For Syriac, scholars have defined
for this task a set of morphological attributes con-
sisting of twelve attributes for the stem and four at-
tributes for the suffix. The attributes for the stem
are as follows: grammatical category, verb conju-
gation, aspect, state, number, person, gender, pro-
noun type, demonstrative category, noun type, nu-
meral type, and participle type. The morphological

attributes for the suffix are gender, person, number,
and contraction. The suffix contraction attribute en-
codes whether the suffix is normal or contracted, a
phonological process involving the attachment of an
enclitic pronoun to a participle. These morphologi-
cal attributes were heavily influenced by those used
by Kiraz (1994), but were streamlined in order to fo-
cus directly on grammatical function. During mor-
phological tagging, each stem is labeled for each of
the stem attributes, and each suffix is labeled for each
of the suffix attributes. For a given grammatical cat-
egory (or POS), only a subset of the morphological
attributes is applicable. For those morphological at-
tributes (both of the stem and of the suffix) that do
not apply, the correct label is ?N/A? (not applicable).
Tables 1 and 2 show the correct stem and suffix tags
for the word ???????, LMLCCON.
The remainder of the paper will proceed as fol-
lows: Section 3 outlines our approach. In Section 4,
we describe our experimental setup; we present re-
sults in Section 5. Section 6 contrasts previous work
with our approach. Finally, in Section 7 we briefly
conclude and offer directions for future work.
2 The Syromorph Approach
Since lack language tools, we focus on automatically
annotating Syriac text in a data-driven fashion based
on the labeled data we have available. Since seg-
mentation, linkage, and morphological tagging are
not mutually independent tasks, we desire models
for the sub-tasks to influence each other. To accom-
modate these requirements, we use a joint pipeline
model (Finkel et al, 2006). In this section, we will
first discuss this joint pipeline model, which we call
syromorph. We then examine each of the individual
sub-models.
2.1 Joint Pipeline Model
Our approach is to create a joint pipeline model con-
sisting of a segmenter, a baseform linker, a root
linker, a suffix tagger, and a stem tagger. Figure 1
shows the dependencies among the sub-models in
the pipeline for a single word. Each sub-model
(oval) has access to the data and predictions (rect-
angles) indicated by the arrows. For example, for a
given word, the stem tagger has access to the previ-
ously predicted stem, baseform, root, and suffix tag.
The baseform linker has access to the segmentation,
most importantly the stem.
The training of syromorph is straightforward.
Each of the individual sub-models is trained sepa-
rately on the true labeled data. Features are extracted
from the local context in the sentence. The local con-
text consists first of predictions for the entire sen-
tence from earlier sub-tasks (those sub-tasks upon
which the sub-task in question depends). We cre-
ated the dependencies shown in Figure 1 taking into
account the difficulty of the tasks and natural depen-
dencies in the language. In addition to the predic-
tions for the entire sentence from previous sub-tasks,
the local context also includes the previous o tags of
the current sub-task, as the standard order o Markov
model does. For example, when the stem tagger is
being trained on a particular sentence, the local con-
text consists of the words in the sentence, the pre-
dicted segmentation, baseform, root, and suffix tags
for each word in the sentence, and additionally the
labels for the previous o stems. To further elaborate
812

input or output and each oval is a process employing a
sub-model.
on the example, since features are extracted from the
local context, for stem tagging we extract features
such as current stem, previous stem, current base-
form, previous baseform, current root, previous root,
current suffix tags, and previous suffix tags. (Here,
?previous? refers to labels on the immediately pre-
ceding word token.)
2.2 Segmentation
The syromorph segmentation model is a hybrid
word- and consonant-level model, based on the
model of Haertel et al (2010) for data-driven dia-
critization. Each of our probabilistic sequence mod-
els is a maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM).
Haertel et al (2010) showed that the distribution
over labels is different for known and words and rare
words. In this work, we only consider words not
seen in training (i.e., ?unknown?) to be rare. Follow-
ing Haertel et al?s (2010) model, a separate model
is trained for each word type seen in training with
the intent of choosing the best segmentation given
that word. This approach is closely related to the
idea of ambiguity classes mentioned in Haji? and
Hladk? (1998).
To handle unknown words, we back off to a
consonant-level model. Our consonant-level seg-
mentation model uses the notion of BI (Beginning
and Inside) tags, which have proven successful in
named-entity recognition. Since there are three
labels in which we are interested (prefix, stem, and
suffix), we apply the beginning and inside notion
to each of them to create six tags: BEGINNING-
PREFIX, INSIDE-PREFIX, BEGINNING-STEM,
INSIDE-STEM, BEGINNING-SUFFIX, and
INSIDE-SUFFIX. We train an MEMM to predict
one of these six tags for each consonant. Further-
more, we constrain the decoder to allow only legal
possible transitions given the current prediction,
so that prefixes must come before stems and stems
before suffixes. In order to capture the unknown
word distributions, we train the consonant-level
model on words occurring only once during training.
We call this word- and consonant-level segmenta-
tion model hybrid. As far as we are aware, this is a
novel approach to segmentation.
2.3 Dictionary Linkage
For dictionary linkage, we divide the problem into
two separate tasks: baseform linkage and root link-
age. For both of these tasks, we use a hybrid model
similar to that used for segmentation, consisting of
a collection of separate MEMMs for each word type
(either a stem or baseform, depending on the linker)
and amodel for unknown (or rare) words. For the un-
known words, we compare two distinct approaches.
The first approach for unknown words is based
on the work of Chrupa?a (2006), including the Mor-
fette system. Instead of predicting a baseform given
a stem, we predict what Chrupa?a calls a lemma-
class. A lemma-class is the transformation specified
by the minimum edit distance between the baseform
(which he calls a lemma) and the stem. The trans-
formation is a series of tuples, where each tuple in-
cludes (1) whether it was an insertion or deletion,
(2) the letter inserted or deleted, and (3) the position
of the insertion or deletion in the string (positions
begin at zero). All operations are assumed to oc-
cur sequentially, as in Morfette. For example, the
transformation of XE;N to XEA would proceed as
follows: delete ; from position 2, insert A into po-
sition 2, delete N from position 3.
813
In hybrid-morfette baseform linkage (respec-
tively, root linkage), we predict a lemma-class (i.e.,
transformation) for each baseform (respectively,
root). The predicted transformation is then applied
to the stem (respectively, baseform) in order to con-
struct the actual target baseform (respectively, root).
The advantage to this method is that common trans-
formations are grouped into a single class, thereby
allowing the model to generalize and adequately
predict baseforms (and roots) that have not been
seen during training, but whose transformations have
been seen. This model is trained on all words in or-
der to capture as many transformations as possible.
The second approach for unknown words, called
hybrid-maxent, uses an MEMM trained on all
words seen in training. Given a stem (respectively,
baseform), this approach predicts only baseforms
(respectively, roots) that were observed in training
data. Thus, this method has a distinct disadvan-
tage when it comes to predicting new forms. This
approach corresponds directly to the approach to
handling unknown -words by Toutanova and Man-
ning (2000) for POS tagging.
With regard to baseform and root linkage, we do
not use the dictionary to constrain possible base-
forms or roots, since we make no initial assumptions
about the completeness of a dictionary.
2.4 Morphological Tagging
For morphological tagging, we break the task into
two separate tasks: tagging the suffix and tagging
the stem. Since there are a number of values that
need to be predicted, we define two ways to ap-
proach the problem. We call the first approach the
monolithic approach, in which the label is the con-
catenation of all the morphological attribute values.
Table 3 illustrates the tagging of an example sen-
tence: the stem tag and suffix tag columns contain
the monolithic tags for stem tagging and suffix tag-
ging. We use an MEMM to predict a monolithic tag
for each stem or suffix and call this model maxent-
mono. No co-occurrence restrictions among related
or complementary morphological tags are directly
enforced. Co-occurrence patterns are observed in
the data, learned, and encoded in the models of the
tagging process. It is worth noting further that con-
straints provided by the baseforms ? predicted by
dictionary linkage ? on the morphological attributes
are likewise not directly enforced. Enforcement of
such constraints would require an infusion of expert
knowledge into the system.
The second approach is to assume that morpho-
logical attributes are independent of each other. We
call this the independent approach. Here, each tag
is predicted by a tagger for a single morphological
attribute. For example, the gender model is ignorant
of the other 11 sub-tags during stem tagging. Using
its local context (which does not include other stem
sub-tags), the model predicts the best gender for a
given word. The top prediction of each of these tag-
gers (12, for stem tagging) is then combined na?vely
with no notion of what combinations may be valid
or invalid. We use MEMMs for each of the single-
attribute taggers. This model is calledmaxent-ind.
2.5 Decoding
Our per-task decoders are beam decoders, with
beam-size b. In particular, we limit the number of
per-stage back-pointers to b due to the large size of
the tagset for some of our sub-models. Although
Viterbi decoding produces the most probable label
sequence given a sequence of unlabeled words, it is
potentially intractible on our hybrid models due to
the unbounded dependence on previous consonant-
level decisions. Our beam decoders produce a good
approximation when tuned properly.
Decoding in syromorph consists of extending the
per-task decoders to allow transitions from each sub-
model to the next sub-model in the pipe. For exam-
ple, in our pipeline, the first sub-model is segmen-
tation. We predict the top n segmentations for the
sentence (i.e., sequences of segmentations), where n
is the number of transitions tomaintain between each
sub-task. Then, we run the remaining sub-tasks with
each of the n sequences as a possible context. After
each sub-task is completed, we narrow the number
of possible contexts back to n.
We swept b and n for various values, and found
b = 5 and n = 5 to be good values that balanced
between accuracy and time; larger values saw only
minute gains in accuracy.

3 Experimental Setup
We are using the Syriac Peshitta New Testament in
the form compiled by Kiraz (1994).2 This data is
segmented, annotated with baseform and root, and
labeled with morphological attributes. Kiraz and
others in the Syriac community refined and corrected
the original annotation while preparing a digital and
print concordance of the New Testament. We aug-
mented Kiraz?s version of the data by segmenting
suffixes and by streamlining the tagset. The dataset
consists of 109,640 word tokens.
Table 3 shows part of a tagged Syriac sentence us-
ing this tagset. The suffix and stem tags consist of
indices representing morphological attributes. In the
example sentence, the suffix tag 1011 represents the
values ?masculine?, ?N/A?, ?plural?, ?normal suf-
fix? for the suffix attributes of gender, person, num-
ber, and contraction. Each value of 0 for each stem
and suffix attribute represents a value of ?N/A?, ex-
cept for that of grammatical category, which always
must have a value other than ?N/A?. Therefore, the
suffix tag 0000 means there is no suffix.
For the stem tags, the attribute order is the same
as that shown in Table 1 from top to bottom. The
following describes the interpretation of the stem
values represented in Table 3. Grammatical cate-
gory values 0, 2, and 3 represent ?verb?, ?noun?,
and ?pronoun?, respectively. (Grammatical cate-
gory has no ?N/A? value.) The verb conjugation
value 1 represents ?peal conjugation?. Aspect value
1 represents ?perfect?. State value 3 represents ?em-
phatic?. Number values 1 and 2 represent ?singular?
and ?plural?. Person values 2 and 3 represent ?sec-

tated this version of the New Testament by hand and required
15 years to do so.
ond? and ?third? person. Gender values 2 and 3 rep-
resent ?masculine? and ?feminine?. Pronoun type
value 2 represents ?demonstrative?. Demonstrative
category value 2 represents ?far?. Finally, noun type
2 represents ?common?. The last two columns of 0
represent ?N/A? for numeral type and particle type.
We implement five sub-tasks: segmentation, base-
form linkage, root linkage, suffix tagging, and stem
tagging. We compare each sub-task to a na?ve ap-
proach as a baseline. In addition to desiring good
sub-models, we also want a joint pipeline model that
significantly outperforms the na?ve joint approach,
which is formed by using each of the following base-
lines in the pipeline framework.
The baseline implementation of segmentation is to
choose the most-frequent label: for a given word,
the baseline predicts the segmentation with which
that word appeared most frequently during training.
For unknown words, it chooses the largest prefix
and largest suffix that is possible for that word from
the list of prefixes and suffixes seen during train-
ing. (This na?ve baseline for unknown words does
not take into account the fact that the stem is often at
least three characters in length.)
For dictionary linkage, the baseline is similar:
both baseform linkage and root linkage use the most-
frequent label approach. Given a stem, the baseline
baseform linker predicts the baseform with which
the stem was seen most frequently during training;
likewise, the baseline root linker predicts the root
from the baseform in a similar manner. For the un-
known stem case, the baseline baseform linker pre-
dicts the baseform to be identical to the stem. For
the unknown baseform case, the baseline root linker
predicts a root identical to the first three consonants
of the baseform, since for Syriac the root is exactly
815
three consonants in a large majority of the cases.
The baselines for stem and suffix tagging are the
most-frequent label approaches. These baselines
are similar to maxent-mono and maxent-ind, us-
ing the monolithic and independent approaches used
by maxent-mono and maxent-ind. The difference
is that instead of using maximum entropy, the na?ve
most-frequent approach is used in its place.
The joint baseline tagger uses each of the compo-
nent baselines in then-best joint pipeline framework.
Because this framework is modular, we can trivially
swap in and out different models for each of the sub-
tasks.
4 Experimental Results
Since we are focusing on under-resourced circum-
stances, we sweep the amount of training data and
produce learning curves to better understand how
our models perform in such circumstances. For each
point in our learning curves and for all other eval-
uations, we employ ten-fold cross-validation. The
learning curves use the chosen percentage of the data
for training and a fixed-size test set from each fold
and report the average accuracy.
The reported task accuracy requires the entire out-
put for that task to be correct in order to be counted as
correct. For example, during stem tagging, if one of
the sub-tags is incorrect, then the entire tag is said to
be incorrect. Furthermore, for syromorph, the out-
puts of every sub-task must be correct in order for
the word token to be counted as correct.
Moving beyond token-level metrics, in order to
understand performance of the system at the level
of individual decisions (including N/A decisions),
we compute decision-level accuracy: we call this
metric total-decisions. For the syromorph method
reported here, there are a total of 20 decisions: 2
for segmentation (prefix and suffix boundaries), 1
for baseform linkage, 1 for root linkage, 4 for suf-
fix tagging, and 12 for stem tagging. This accuracy
helps us to assess the number of decisions a human
annotator would need to correct, if data were pre-
annotated by a given model. Excluding N/A deci-
sions, we compute per-decision coverage and accu-
racy. These metrics are called applicable-coverage
and applicable-accuracy.
We show results on both the individual sub-tasks
and the entire joint task. Since previous sub-
tasks can adversely affect tasks further down in
the pipeline, we evaluate the sub-models by plac-
ing them in the pipeline with other (simulated) sub-
models that correctly predict every instance. For
example, when testing a root linker, we place the
root linker to be evaluated in the pipeline with a
segmenter, baseform linker, and taggers that return
the correct label for every prediction. This gives an
upper-bound for the individual model, removes the
possibility of error propagation, and shows how well
that model performs without the effects of the other
models in the pipeline.
For our results, unknown accuracy is the accuracy
of unknown instances, specific to the task, at training
time. In the case of baseform linkage, for example,
a stem is considered unknown if that stem was not
seen during training. It is therefore possible to have
a known word with an unknown stem and vice versa.
As in other NLP problems, unknown instances are a
manifestation of training data sparsity.
4.1 Baseline Results
Table 4 is grouped by sub-task and reports the results
of each of the baseline sub-tasks in the first row of
each group. Each of the baselines performs surpris-
ingly well. The accuracies of the baselines for most
of the tasks are high because the ambiguity of the
labels given the instance is quite low: the average
ambiguity across word types for segmentation, base-
form linkage, root linkage, suffix tagging, and stem
tagging are 1.01, 1.05, 1.02, 1.35, and 1.47, respec-
tively.
Preliminary experiments indicated that if we had
trained a baseline model using a single prediction (a
monolithic concatenation of the predictions for all
tasks) per token rather than separating the tasks, the
baseline tagging accuracy would have been lower.
Note that the unknown tagging accuracy for the
monolithic suffix tagger is not applicable, because
there were no test suffixes that were not seen during
training.
4.2 Individual Model Results
Table 4 also shows the results for the individual
models. In the table, SEG, BFL, RTL, SUFFIX,
and STEM represent segmentation, baseform link-
age, root linkage, suffix tagging, and stem tagging,

respectively. Even though the baselines were high,
each individual model outperformed its respective
baseline, with the exception of the root linker. Two
of the most interesting results are the known ac-
curacy of the baseform linkers hybrid-maxent and
hybrid-morfette. As hybrid models, the difference
between them lies only in the treatment of unknown
words; however, the known accuracy of the mor-
fette model drops fairly significantly. This is due
to the unknown words altering the weights for fea-
tures in which those words occur. For instance, if
the previous word is unknown and a baseform that
was never seen was predicted, then the weights on
the next word for all features that contain that un-
known word will be quite different than if that pre-
vious word were a known word.
It is also worth noting that the stem tagger is by
far the worst model in this group of models, but it is
also the most difficult task. The largest gains in im-
proving the entire systemwould come from focusing
attention on that task.

joint model incorporating the ?morfette? variants
performs best on unknown cases.
Decision-level metrics for the SEG:hybrid /
BFL and RTL:hybrid-maxent / SUFFIX and
STEM:maxent-mono model are as follows: for
total-decisions, the model achieves an accuracy
of 97.08%, compared to 95.50% accuracy for the
baseline, amounting to a 35.11% reduction in error
rate over the baseline; for applicable-coverage and
applicable-accuracy this model achieved 93.45%
and 93.81%, respectively, compared to the baseline?s
90.03% and 91.44%.
Figures 2, 3, and 4 show learning curves for to-
tal, known, and unknown accuracies for the joint
pipeline model. As can be seen in Figure 2, by the
time we reach 10% of the training data, syromorph
is significantly better than the baseline. In fact, at
35% of the training data, our joint pipeline model
outperforms the baseline trained with all available
training data.
Figure 3 shows the baseline performing quite well
on known words with very low amounts of data.
Since the x-axis varies the amount of training data,
the meaning of ?known? and ?unknown? evolves as
we move to the right of the graph; consequently, the

left and right sides of the graph are incomparable.
When the percentage of training data is very low,
the percentage of unknown words is high, and the
number of known words is relatively low. On this
dataset, the more frequent words tend to be less am-
biguous, giving the most-frequent taggers an advan-
tage in a small random sample. For this reason, the
baseline performs very well on known accuracy with
lower amounts of training data.
Figure 4 clearly shows that hybrid-morfette link-
ers outperform hybrid-maxent linkers on unknown
words. However, Figures 2- 4 show that hybrid-
morfette?s advantage on unknown words is coun-
teracted by its lower performance on known words;
therefore, it has slightly lower overall accuracy than
hybrid-maxent.
5 Related Work
The most closely related work to our approach is
the Morfette tool for labeling inflectional morphol-
ogy (Chrupa?a et al, 2008). Chrupa?a et al cre-
ated a tool that labels Polish, Romanian, and Span-
ish with morphological information as well as base-
forms. It is a supervised learning approach that
requires data labeled with both morphological tags
and baseforms. This approach creates two separate
models (a morphological tagger and a lemmatizer)
and combines the decoding process in order to cre-
ate a joint model that predicts both morphological
tags and the baseform. Morfette uses MEMMs for
both models and has access to predicted labels in
the feature set. Reported accuracy rates are 96.08%,
93.83%, and 81.19% for joint accuracy on datasets
trained with fewer than 100,000 tokens for Roma-
nian, Spanish, and Polish, respectively. The major
difference between this work and ours is the degree
of morphological analysis required by the languages.
Chrupa?a et al neglect segmentation, a task not as
intuitive for their languages as it is for Syriac. These
languages also require only linkage to a baseform, as
no root exists.
Also closely related is the work of Daya, Roth, and
Wintner (2008) on Hebrew. The authors use the no-
tion of patterns into which root consonants are in-
jected to compose Semitic words. They employ lin-
guistic knowledge (specifically, lists of prefixes, suf-
fixes, and ?knowledge of word-formation processes?
combined with SNoW, a multi-class classifier that
has been shown to work well in other NLP tasks.
The major difference between this approach and the
method presented in this paper is that this method
does not require the extra knowledge required to en-
code word-formation processes. A further point of
difference is our use of hybrid word- and consonant-
level models, after Haertel et al (2010). Their work
builds on the work of Shacham and Wintner (2007),
which is also related to that of Habash and Rambow,
described below.
Work by Lee et al (2003) is themost relevant work
for segmentation, since they segment Arabic, closely
related to Syriac, with a data-driven approach. Lee
et al use an unsupervised algorithm bootstrapped
with manually segmented data to learn the segmen-
tation for Arabic without any additional language re-
818
sources. At the heart of the algorithm is a word-level
trigram language model, which captures the correct
weights for prefixes and suffixes. They report an ac-
curacy of 97%. We opted to use our own segmenter
because we felt we could achieve higher accuracy
with the hybrid segmenter.
Mohamed and K?bler (2010a, 2010b) report on
closely related work for morphological tagging.
They use a data-driven approach to find the POS tags
for Arabic, using both word tokens and segmented
words as inputs for their system. Although their seg-
mentation performance is high, they report that ac-
curacy is lower when first segmenting word tokens.
They employ TiMBL, a memory-based learner, as
their model and report an accuracy of 94.74%.
Habash and Rambow (2005) currently have the
most accurate approach for Arabic morphological
analysis using additional language tools. They focus
on morphological disambiguation (tagging), given
morphological segmentation in the output of the
morphological analyzer. For each word, they first
run it through the morphological analyzer to reduce
the number of possible outputs. They then train a
separate Support Vector Machine (SVM) for each
morphological attribute (ten in all). They look at dif-
ferent ways of combining these outputs to match an
output from the morphological analyzer. For their
best model, they report an overall tag accuracy of
97.6%.
Others have used morphological analyzers and
other language tools for morphological disambigua-
tion coupled with segmentation. The following
works exemplify this approach: Diab et al (2004)
use a POS tagger to jointly segment, POS tag, and
chunk base-phrases for Arabic with SVMs. Kudo
et al (2004) use SVMs to morphologically tag
Japanese. Smith et al (2005) use SVMs for seg-
mentation, lemmatization, and POS tagging for Ara-
bic, Korean, and Czech. Petkevi? (2001) use a mor-
phological analyzer and additional simple rules for
morphological disambiguation of Czech. Mansour
et al (2007) and Bar-haim et al (2008) both use hid-
denMarkov models to POS tag Hebrew, with the lat-
ter including segmentation as part of the task.
For Syriac, a morphological analyzer is not avail-
able. Kiraz (2000) created a Syriac morphological
analyzer using finite-state methods; however, it was
developed on outdated and now inaccessible equip-
ment and is no longer working or available to us.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We have shown that we can effectively model seg-
mentation, linkage to headwords in a dictionary, and
morphological tagging using a joint model called sy-
romorph. We have introduced novel approaches for
segmentation, dictionary linkage, and morphologi-
cal tagging, and each of these approaches has out-
performed its corresponding na?ve baseline. Further-
more, we have shown that for Syriac, a data-driven
approach seems to be an appropriate way to solve
these problems in an under-resourced setting.
We hope to use this combined model for pre-
annotation in an active learning setting to aid anno-
tators in labeling a large Syriac corpus. This corpus
will contain data spanning multiple centuries and a
variety of authors and genres. Future work will re-
quire addressing issues encountered in this corpus.
In addition, there is much to do in getting the over-
all tag accuracy closer to the accuracy of individual
decisions. We leave further feature engineering for
the stem tagger and the exploration of possible new
morphological tagging techniques for future work.
Finally, future work includes the application of the
syromorph methodology to other under-resourced
Semitic languages.
