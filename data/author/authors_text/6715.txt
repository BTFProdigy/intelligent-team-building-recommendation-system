Abstract 
In this paper, we present the current state of 
development of a large-scale lexicon built at 
LabEL1 for Portuguese. We will concentrate on 
multiword expressions (MWE), particularly on 
multiword nouns, (i) illustrating their most relevant 
morphological features, and (ii) pointing out the 
methods and techniques adopted to generate  the 
inflected forms from lemmas. Moreover, we 
describe a corpus-based aproach for the acquisition 
of new multiword nouns, which  led to a 
significant enlargement of the existing lexicon. 
Evaluation results concerning lexical coverage in 
the corpus are also discussed. 
1 Introduction 
MWEs have been viewed, for long time, as 
marginal idiosyncratic combinations of words. In 
recent years, however, there has been a growing 
awareness in the NLP community of the problems 
that MWEs pose and the need for their robust 
handling. Several major conferences and satellite 
workshops have been dedicated to the subject 
(ACL, EACL, LREC, for instance); major 
publications devote thematic issues to MWEs. 
Anticipating that growing interest, over the last 
years, a significant part of LabEL?s research has 
been devoted to the development of large-scale, 
linguistically precise language resources, namely 
to the construction of computational lexicons for 
simple  and multiword units (Eleut?rio et al, 1995; 
Ranchhod et al, 1999; Ranchhod et al, 2004). 
In fact, we have observed that MWEs are used 
frequently in both everyday language and technical 
and scientific texts to express ideas and concepts 
that in general cannot be stated by ?free? linguistic 
structures. They include a large range of different 
linguistic phenomena, such as: (i) lexical 
compounds (nouns: cellular phone, rush hour, New 
Jersey; adjectives: well-known; adverbs: for the 
time being, in short; prepositions and conjunctions:

in spite of, in order to) (ii) phrasal verbs (give up); 
(iii) light verbs (give a lecture); (iv) fixed 
(proverbs and maxims) and semi-fixed sentences 
(to see the light at the end of the tunnel; to take the 
Lord? name in vain). From a linguistic point of 
view, all these expressions exhibit distributional 
and selectional constraints, i.e. they lack 
compositionality, and frequently have idiomatic 
interpretations. 
In this paper, we focus on multiword nouns. 
Special attention will be given to their 
formalization and generation, using INTEX, a 
public FST (Finite-State Transducer) based NLP 
system [Silberztein, 1993]. In this context, we 
present the main characteristics of a new 
inflectional module, conceived at LabEL, fully 
compatible with this system. Next, we describe the 
acquisition methodology used to gather new 
dictionary entries in a fragment (extracts 1,520,001 
to 1,567,625) of the non-annotated version of a 
public Portuguese corpus, CETEMPublico2. 
Finally, based on this experiment, we assess, on 
the one hand, the  dictionary increase, and, on the 
other hand, the lexical coverage improvement in 
the referred corpus. 
2 Characterization of Multiword Nouns 
Multiword (or compound) nouns are composed of 
non-capitalized simple words. Superficially, they 
seem to result from general rules of word 
combinations but they present constraints 
(morphological, combinatorial, etc.) concerning 
the properties they were supposed to have. 
Regarding inflection, general rules presented by 
grammarians do apply to some cases, but most 
compounds exhibit inflectional restrictions on 
gender or number that cannot be described by the 
morphological properties of their constituents. 
Table 1 presents a few examples of the most 
representative classes of compound nouns in 
Portuguese.

 CETEMPublico is a journalistic corpus containing 
about 180 million words (see Santos and Rocha, 2001 
for techical information).
