Abstract
This paper describes the results of cor-
pus and experimental investigation into
the factors that affect the way clarifica-
tion questions in dialogue are interpreted,
and the way they are responded to. We
present some results from an investigation
using the BNC which show some general
correlations between clarification request
type, likelihood of answering, answer type
and distance between question and an-
swer. We then describe a new experi-
mental technique for integrating manip-
ulations into text-based synchronous dia-
logue, and give more specific results con-
cerning the effect of word category and
level of grounding on interpretation and
response type.
1 Introduction
Requesting clarification is a vital part of the com-
municative process and has received attention from
both the formal semantic (Ginzburg and Cooper,
2001; Ginzburg and Cooper, forthcoming) and con-
versation analytic traditions (Schegloff, 1987), but
little in the computational dialogue system commu-
nity. In theory, a perfect dialogue system should be
able to interpret and deal with clarification requests
(CRs) made by the user in order to elicit clarifica-
tion of some part of a system utterance, and be able
to request clarification itelf of some part of a user ut-
terance. This is no easy task ? CRs may take many
different forms (often highly elliptical), and can be
intended to be interpreted with many different read-
ings which query different aspects of the original ut-
terance. As a result, dialogue system design has tra-
ditionally attempted to avoid the necessity for CR
interpretation by making system utterances as clear
and precise as possible, and avoid having to generate
all but the most simple CRs by using robust shallow
methods of interpretation or by relying on highly
domain-dependent lexicons and grammars. How-
ever, as systems become more human-like, it seems
likely that we will have to cope with user CRs at
some stage; and the ability to generate system CRs
can be useful in order to repair misunderstanding,
disambiguate other utterances, and learn new words
? see (Knight, 1996; Dusan and Flanagan, 2002;
Purver, 2002).
The investigations presented here had two main
aims: to examine (a) how CRs are interpreted, and
(b) how they are responded to. The two are clearly
dependent ? the response must depend on the inter-
pretation ? but there are many other influencing fac-
tors such as CR form, context and level of ground-
ing. Answers to (a) should help us with the follow-
ing questions:
? What factors can help us disambiguate and cor-
rectly interpret user CRs?
? What factors should govern generation of sys-
tem CRs such that they are correctly interpreted
by the user?
Answers to (b) should help with the following re-
lated questions:
? How (and when) should we answer user CRs?
? How (and when) should we expect users to re-
spond to system CRs?
The paper is organised as follows. The next sec-
tion gives a brief overview of CRs in general and
some previous corpus work. Section 3 describes fur-
ther corpus work which gives some general results
concerning response type. Section 4 then describes
a text-based dialogue experiment examining the de-
tailed effects on interpretation and response of part-
of-speech (PoS) type and level of grounding for one
particular CR form, and section 5 then draws some
general conclusions.
2 Clarification Requests
Purver et al (2001; 2002) presented a taxonomy
of CR forms and readings derived from a corpus
study using the British National Corpus (BNC) ?
see (Burnard, 2000). This showed that some forms
showed a high correlation with certain readings, but
that some were highly ambiguous.
Purver et al (2002)?s taxonomy of CR forms is
given in table 1 and CR readings in table 21. Some
CRs (the non-reprise class) explicitly identify the
clarification required, e.g. ?What did you say?? or
?What do you mean??, and some forms (e.g. literal
reprises) appear to favour a particular reading almost
exclusively, but most are more ambiguous. Indeed,
they found that the two most common forms (the
conventional and reprise fragment form) could take
any reading.
Although this corpus study provided informa-
tion about the distribution of different CR forms
and readings, it did not provide any information
about the specific conditions which prompt partic-
ular readings and affect how the CR is answered.
In this paper we concentrate mostly on the reprise
fragment (RF) form, where only a single part of
the problem utterance, possibly a single word, is
reprised2 as in example (1). This form is not only
1They also give a correction reading, which we have ex-
cluded here: such CRs are almost exclusively self-corrections
and as such do not fit well with our discussion here. They are
also very rare compared with the other classes, making up only
about 2% of CRs.
2Such reprises need not be verbatim repeats: users may use
anaphoric terms or use a clearer expression in order to clarify
the fragment in question.
common (approximately 30% of CRs in the previ-
ous study) and can appear with many readings (al-
though biased towards a clausal reading ? 87% of
occurrences), but specifies the problematic element
that it clarifies quite precisely, and therefore should
give us scope for examining the effect of features of
that element.

particular, like
Jake: What?
Gary: the word skeilth
Jake: Skeilth?
Lilias: Mm.
Gary: Aha.
Jake: Aye, yeah, yeah, take skeilth.
Intuitively, at least two such features would be
expected to affect the type of reading assigned to
a RF: PoS category and level of grounding.4 The
PoS category of the reprised word should influence
expectations about what is being clarified. For ex-
ample, reprise of a content word (e.g. noun or verb)
should be more likely to signal a constituent problem
than a reprise of a function word (e.g. preposition or
determiner). Dialogue participants would normally
assume that the meaning of function words is well
known in a particular linguistic community and that,
as a result, a reprise of a function word is more likely
to signal clausal or lexical problems. RF interpreta-
tion should also depend on whether a reprised frag-
ment is already considered to have been grounded
by the participants in a conversation. For example,
a reprise of a proper noun would be more likely to
be read as signalling a constituent problem if it oc-
curs on the first mention than on second mention.
All things being equal, the content of a constituent
is already considered to have been established by the
time a second mention occurs.
3 Corpus Investigation
Accordingly we have re-examined the corpus from
the above study in order to add information about

information in the BNC. In the future we hope to investigate
this using other corpora and experimental methods.

category, grounding and method of answering.
3.1 Method
The same corpus was re-marked for four attributes:
response type and CR-answer distance, and the PoS
and last mention of the original source element.
The markup scheme used for response type
evolved during the study and is shown in table 3:
it includes classification of apparently unanswered
CRs into those that may have been answered, but
the sentence possibly containing an answer was tran-
scribed in the BNC as <unclear>; those that ap-
pear to have remained unanswered because the CR
initiator continued their turn without pause; and
those that are not answered at all (or at least where
we have no indication of an answer ? eye contact,
head movement etc. are not recorded in the BNC but
could function as answers). In cases where the ini-
tial response was followed by further information,
both were recorded, but the results here are pre-
sented only for the initial response. Further work
later may take both into account, along the lines of
(Hockey et al, 1997) who showed this to be impor-
tant for questions in general.
CR-answer distance was marked in terms of the
sentence numbering scheme in the BNC ? in these
cases it corresponds very closely to distance in
speaker turns, although the correspondence is not
exact.
PoS category and time of last mention of the
source element were marked, but have not currently
been used due to lack of useful data (see below).
Reliability of the markup has not yet been exam-
ined. However, the method is close to that of (Purver
et al, 2002) (and the corpus is identical), where re-
liability was examined and found to be acceptable.
We then examined the correlation between CR type
and response type, between reading and response
type, and the spread of CR-answer distance.
3.2 Results
3.2.1 Response Type
Results for response type are shown in table 4 as
raw numbers, and also in table 5 as percentages for
each CR type, with the none, cont, uncl and qury
classes conflated as one ?unanswered? class, and
only the most common 4 CR forms shown.
The most striking result is perhaps the high over-
all number of CRs that do not receive an answer:
39% of all CRs do not appear to be answered overall,
although this reduces to 17% when taking account
of those marked uncl (possible answers transcribed
none No answer
cont CR initiator continues immediately
uncl Possible answer but transcribed as <unclear>
qury CR explicitly queried
frg Answered with parallel fragment
sent Answered with full sentence
yn Answered with polar particle
Table 3: CR response types
as <unclear>) and cont (the CR-raiser continues
without waiting). The most common forms (conven-
tional and RF) appear to be answered least ? around
45% go unanswered for both. The form which ap-
pears to be most likely to be answered overall is the
explicit non-conventional form.
Some forms appear to have high correlations
with particular response types. As might be ex-
pected, sluices (which are wh-questions) are gen-
erally answered with fragments, and never with a
polar yes/no answer. Yes/no answers also seem to
be unsuitable for the conventional CR form, which
is generally answered with a full sentence. RFs,
conversely, are not often answered with full sen-
tences, but can be responded to either by fragments
or yes/no answers.
Similarly, from tables 6 and 7 (again, percentages
given for each CR reading, with ?unanswered? re-
sponse types conflated and only the most common 3
readings shown) we can see that there is a correla-
tion between reading and response type, but that this
correlation is also not as simple as a direct reading-
answer correspondence. Clausal CRs are unlikely to
be answered with full sentences, but can get either
fragment or yes/no responses. Constituent CRs are
less likely to get yes/no responses but could get ei-
ther other type. Interestingly, constituent CRs seem
to be roughly twice as likely to get a response as
clausal or lexical CRs (even though there are fewer
examples of constituent CRs than the others, this
difference is statistically significant, with a ?2(1) test
showing <0.5% probability of independence).
3.2.2 Answer Distance
Results for CR-answer distance are shown in ta-
ble 8. It is clear that the vast majority (94%) of CRs
that are answered are answered in the immediately

equivalent figures for non-clarificational questions,
a study is in progress and initial indications are that
in general, answers are less immediate: only about
70% have distance 1, with some up to distance 6.5
We therefore expect that (a) answering user CRs
must be done immediately, and that any dialogue
management scheme must take this into account,
and (b) we should expect answers to any system
CRs to come immediately ? interpretation routines
(we are thinking especially of any ellipsis resolution
routines here) should not assume that later turns are

3.2.3 Further Details
While interesting, we would like to know more
detail than the general trends described above: in
particular we would like to know the effect of
the factors we have mentioned (word category and
grounding) for particular forms. As stated above,
we concentrate here on the reprise fragment form.
Examination of original CR source fragment PoS
category, in order to test the effect of the con-
tent/function distinction, showed that almost all RFs
were of content words or whole phrases: only 6 of
118 RFs were of function words, all of which were
determiners (mostly numbers). This is interesting in
itself: perhaps RFs are unlikely to be used to clarify
uses of e.g. prepositions. However, the effect may
be due to lack of data, and does not provide us with
any way of testing the distinction between clausal
and constituent reading that we expect.
Markup of last mention of the original source
fragment has also not given results in which we can
be confident. For RFs, we have seen that all con-
stituent readings occur on the first mention of the
fragment (as expected) ? but there are too few of
these examples to draw any firm conclusions. It is
also impossible to know whether first mention in the
transcription is really the first mention between the
participants: we do not know what happened before
the tape was turned on, what their shared history is,
or what is said during the frequent portions marked
as <unclear>.
So we need more information than our current
corpus can provide. In order to examine these ef-
fects properly we have therefore designed an exper-
imental technique to allow dialogues to be manipu-
lated directly, with reprises with the desired proper-
ties automatically introduced into the conversation.
The next section describes this technique and the ex-
periment performed.
4 Experimental Work
Empirical analyses of dialogue phenomena have
typically focused either on detailed descriptive anal-
yses of corpora of conversations (Schegloff, 1987)
or on the experimental manipulation of relatively
global parameters of interaction such as task type or
communicative modality (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs,
1986), (Garrod and Doherty, 1994). These stud-
ies have been used to to motivate a variety of pro-
posals about turn-level mechanisms and procedures
that sustain dialogue co-ordination. Further devel-
opment and testing of these proposals has, how-
ever, been limited by the indirect nature of the avail-
able evidence. Corpus studies provide, retrospec-
tive, correlational data which is susceptible to chal-
lenge and re-interpretation. Current psycholinguis-
tic techniques do not provide ways of integrating ex-
perimental manipulations into interactions in a man-
ner that is sensitive to the linguistic and conversa-
tional context. This section introduces a technique
for carrying out experiments in which text-based in-
teractions can be directly manipulated at the turn
level, and gives the results of an experiment which
uses this approach to investigate the effects of the
factors mentioned above on interpretation and re-
ponse to RFs. We also briefly discuss the range of
potential applications and some of the practical lim-
itations of the approach in the context of the experi-
mental results.
4.1 Manipulating ?Chat? Interactions
The experimental technique presented here draws on
two general developments. Firstly, the increasing
use of text-based forms of synchronous conversa-
tional interaction, for example: chat rooms (MUD?s,
MOO?s etc.), instant messaging, and some online
conferencing tools. Secondly, advances in natural
language processing technology which make some
forms of text processing and transformation fast
enough to be performed on a time scale consistent
with exchanges of turns in synchronous text chat.
The basic paradigm involves pairs of subjects,
seated in different rooms, communicating using a
synchronous text chat tool (see figure 1 for an ex-
ample). However, instead of passing each completed
turn directly to the appropriate chat clients, each turn
is routed via a server. Depending on the specific
goals of the experiment, the server can be used to
systematically modify turns in a variety of ways. For
example, some simple forms of mis-communication
can be introduced into an interaction by transform-
ing the order of characters in some of the input
words or by substituting words with plausible non-
words. Importantly, the server controls which mod-
ifications are broadcast to which participant. So, if
participant A types the word ?table? the sever can
echo back A: table to participant A and a trans-
formed version, say, ?blate? to participant B who
sees A: blate. The ability to set up controlled
asymmetries of this kind between the participants in
a interaction creates a powerful range of experimen-
tal possibilities. Here, we describe an application of
this technique to the investigation of reprise clarifi-
cation requests (CR?s).
A chat-tool experiment was designed to test the
following hypotheses:
1. RFs for function words will normally receive
clausal readings, whereas both clausal and con-
stituent readings will be available for content
words.
2. RFs for content words will receive more con-
stituent readings on first mention than on sec-
ond mention.
3. No difference is predicted for RFs for function
words on first vs. second mention.
4.2 Method
Two tasks were used to elicit dialogue, a balloon
debate and a story-telling task. In the balloon de-
bate subjects are presented with a fictional scenario
in which a balloon is losing altitude and about to
crash. The only way for any of three passengers to
survive is for one of them to jump to a certain death.
The three passengers are; Dr. Nick Riviera, a can-
cer scientist, Mrs. Susie Derkins, a pregnant primary
school teacher, and Mr. Tom Derkins, the balloon
pilot and Susie?s husband. Subjects are asked to de-
cide who should jump. The advantages of this task
are that it is effective at generating debates between
subjects and involves repeated references to particu-
lar individuals.
Following (Bavelas et al, 1992), the second di-
alogue task used was the story-telling task. In this
case subjects are asked to relate a ?near-miss? story
about some experience in which something bad al-
most happened but in the end everything was okay.
This was chosen because, unlike the balloon task,
the topic of the exchange is unrestricted, in effect
a random factor, and the interaction relates to real
events.
4.2.1 Subjects
Twenty-eight subjects were recruited, 20 male
and 8 female, average age 19 years, from computer
science and IT undergraduate students. They were
recruited in pairs to ensure that the members of a
pair were familiar with one another and only sub-
jects who had experience with some form of text
chat such as chat rooms, IRC, ICQ or other mes-
saging systems were used. Each subject was paid
at a rate of ?7.50 per hour for participating in the
experiment.
4.2.2 Materials
A custom experimental chat tool, written in Java
and Perl, was used for the experiment. The user in-
terface is similar to instant messaging applications:
a lower window is used to enter text, and the con-
versation is displayed in the main upper window as
it emerges (see figure 1). The chat clients were run
on two Fujitsu LCD tablet computers with text in-
put via standard external keyboards, with the server
running on a standard PC in a separate room.
User Interface The Chattool client user interface
is written in Java and is designed to be familiar
to subjects experienced with instant messaging/chat
applications. The application window is split into
two panes: a lower pane for text entry and an up-
per pane in which the conversation is displayed (see
figure 1). A status display between the two panes
shows whether the other participant is active (typ-
ing) at any time. This can be artificially controlled
during the generation of artificial turns to make it
appear as if they are generated by the other partici-
pant. The client also has the ability to display an er-
ror message and prevent text entry: this can be used
to delay one participant while the other is engaged
in an artificially-generated turn sequence.
Server Each turn is submitted to a server (also
written in Java) on a separate machine when a ?Send?
button or the ?Return? key is pressed. This server
passes the text to a NLP component for processing
and possible transformation, and then displays the
original version to the originator client, and the pro-
cessed (or artificially generated) version to the other
client. The server records all turns, together with
each key press from both clients, for later analysis.
This data is also used on the fly to control the speed
and capitalisation of artificially generated turns, to
be as realistic a simulation of the relevant subject as
possible.
NLP Component The NLP component consists
of a Perl text-processing module which commu-
nicates with various external NLP modules as re-
quired: PoS tagging can be performed using LT-
POS (Mikheev, 1997), word rarity/frequency tag-
ging using a custom tagger based on the BNC (Kil-
garriff, 1997), and synonym generation using Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998).
Experimental parameters are specified as a set of
rules which are applied to each word in turn. Pre-
conditions for the application of the rule can be spec-
ified in terms of PoS, word frequency and the word
itself, together with contextual factors such as the
time since the last artificial turn was generated, and
a probability threshold to prevent behaviour appear-
ing too regular. The effect of the rule can be to
transform the word in question (by substitution with
another word, a synonym or a randomly generated
non-word, or by letter order scrambling) or to trigger
an artificially generated turn sequence (currently a
reprise fragment, followed by an acknowledgement,
although other turn types are possible).
The current experimental setup consists of rules
which generate pairs of RFs and subsequent
acknowledgements6, for proper nouns, common
nouns, verbs, determiners and prepositions, with
probabilities determined during a pilot experiment
to give reasonable numbers of RFs per subject. No
use is made of word rarity or synonyms.
The turn sequences are carried out by (a) present-
ing the artificially-generated RF to the relevant client
only; (b) waiting for a response from that client, pre-
venting the other client from getting too far ahead
by locking the interface if necessary; (c) presenting
an acknowledgement to that response; and (d) pre-
senting any text typed by the other client during the
sequence.
4.2.3 Procedure
Prior to taking part subjects were informed that
the experimenters were carrying out a study of the
effects of a network-based chat tool on the way peo-
6Acknowledgements are randomly chosen amongst: ?ah?,
?oh?, ?oh ok?, ?right?, ?oh right?, ?uh huh?, ?i see?, ?sure?.
ple interact with one another. They were told that
their interaction would be logged, anonymously, and
kept for subsequent analysis. Subjects were advised
that they could also request the log to be deleted af-
ter completion of the interaction. They were not in-
formed of the artificial interventions until afterwards
(see below).
At the start of the experiment subjects were given
a brief demonstration of the operation of the chat
tool.
To prevent concurrent verbal or gestural interac-
tion subjects were seated in separate rooms. Each
pair performed both dialogue tasks and were given
written instructions in each case. The balloon task
was carried out once and the story-telling task twice;
one story for each participant. To control for or-
der effects the order of presentation of the two tasks
was counterbalanced across pairs. A 10-minute time
limit was imposed on both tasks. At the end of
the experiment subjects were fully debriefed and the
intervention using ?artificial? clarifications was ex-
plained to them.
This resulted in a within-subjects design with two
factors; category of reprise fragment and level of
grounding (first vs. second mention).
After the experiment, the logs were manually cor-
rected for the PoS category of the RF and for the
first/second mention clarification. PoS required cor-
rection as the tagger produced incorrect word cate-
gories in approximately 30% of cases. In some in-
stances this was due to typing errors or text-specific
conventions, such as ?k? for ?okay?, that were not
recognised. Detection and classification of proper
nouns was also sensitive to capitalisation. Subjects
were not consistent or conventional in their capitali-
sation of words and this caused some misclassifica-
tions. In addition a small proportion of erroneous
tags were found. Each system-generated CR was
checked and, where appropriate, corrected. Because
pairs completed both tasks together CRs classified
as ?first mentions? were checked to ensure that they
hadn?t already occured in a previous dialogue.
4.3 Results
The readings attributed to each RF were classified
in the same way as the original BNC-based cor-
pus, with the addition of one further category: non-
clarificational, referring to situations in which the
fragment is treated as something other than a CR
(this did not apply when building the original cor-
pus, as only utterances treated as CRs were con-
sidered). In the experimental results, gap, lexical
and non-clarificational readings were low frequency
events (4, 1 and 8 instances respectively) and no in-
stances of correction readings were noted. These fig-
ures are comparable with (Purver et al, 2002)?s ob-
servations for the BNC. For statistical analysis these
three categories of reading were grouped together as
?Other?.
Across the corpus as a whole a total of 215
system-generated RFs were produced. In 50% of
cases the system-generated clarification received no
response from the target participant. This may be
due in part to the medium: unlike verbal exchanges,
participants in text-chat can produce their turns si-
multaneously. This can result in turns getting out
of sequence since users may still be responding to a
prior turn when a new turn arrives. Users must then
trade off the cost of undoing their turn in progress
to respond to the new one, against going ahead any-
way and responding to the new turn later if it seems
necessary. Thus in some cases we observed that the
response to a clarification was displaced to the end
of the turn in progress or to a subsequent turn. How-
ever, comparison with the BNC results from sec-
tion 3 above show similar figures: only 56% of the
frg class received a clear answer. Although the
true figure will be higher (of the 56%, 5% may have
been answered, but the next turn was transcribed as
<unclear>, and we cannot know in how many
cases the reprise may have been answered using
non-verbal signals), it seems likely that a significant
proportion may simply be ignored.

Table 9: Frequency of Reading Types By RF Cate-
gory and Mention
The distribution of reading types according to
word category was tested firstly by comparing the
frequency of Clausal, Constituent, and Other read-
ings for content words and function words. This
proved to be reliably different (?2(2) = 35.3, p =
0.00).7 As table 9 shows, RFs of Function words
were almost exclusively interpreted as Other, i.e. ei-
ther Gap, Lexical or Non-clarificational. By contrast
Content word reprises were interpreted as Clausal
CRs 53% of the time, as Constituent CRs 29% of
the time and as Other 18% of the time.
Content word and Function word clarifications
were also compared for the the frequency with
which they received a response. This showed no
reliable difference (?2(1) = 1.95, p = 0.16) indicat-
ing that although the pattern of interpretation for
Content and Function reprises is different they are
equally likely to receive some kind of response.
The influence of grounding on reading type was
assessed firstly by comparing the relative frequency
of Constituent, Clausal and Other readings on first
and second mention. This was reliably different
(?2(2) = 6.28, p = 0.04) indicating that level of
grounding affects the reading assigned. A focussed
comparison of Constituent and Clausal readings on
first and second mention shows no reliable differ-
ence (?2(1) = 0.0, p = 0.92). Together these findings
indicate that, across all word categories, Constituent
and Clausal readings are more likely for RF?s of a
first mention than a second mention and, conversely,
Other readings are less likely for RF?s to a first men-
tion than a second mention.
The effect of grounding on the relative frequency
with which a clarification received a response was
also tested. This indicated a strong effect of mention
(?2(1) = 12.01, p = 0.00); 58% of reprise clarifications
of first mentions recieved a response whereas only
33% of second mention clarifications did.
4.4 Discussion
The experimental results support two basic conclu-
sions. Firstly, people?s interpretation of the type of
CR a reprise fragment is intended to make is influ-
enced both by the category of the reprise fragment
and its level of grounding. Secondly, reprise frag-
ment CRs to first mentions are much more likely to
be responded to than reprise fragment CRs for sec-

tests.
ond mentions.
Text-based and verbal interaction have different
properties as communicative media. Amongst other
things, in text-chat turns take longer to produce,
are normally produced in overlap, and they persist
for longer. However, even given these differences,
the general pattern of clarifications observed in the
experimental task is similar to that noted in ver-
bal dialogue. In particular, Lexical, Gap and Non-
clarificational readings are infrequent and reprise
fragment clarifications are ignored with surprising
frequency. In the present data, the clearest contrast
between text-based and verbal interaction is in the
relative frequency of Constituent and Clausal read-
ings. In the BNC reprise fragments receive Clausal
readings in 87% of cases, and constituent readings in
6% of cases. In the experimental corpus they receive
Clausal readings in 48% of cases and Constituent
readings in 34% of cases.
These findings demonstrate the viability, and
some limitations, of investigating dialogue co-
ordination through the manipulation of chat-tool
based interactions. The chat tool was successful
in producing plausible clarification sequences. Al-
though in some cases participants had difficulty
making sense of the artificial clarifications this did
not make them distinguishable from other, real, but
equally problematic turns from other participants.
The clarifications were mostly successful in creat-
ing realistic exchanges such as those illustrated in
figures 2 and 3. When questioned during debriefing,
no participants reported any suspicions about the ex-
perimental manipulation.
The main practical difficulty encountered in the
present study related to text-chat conventions such
as novel spellings, abbreviations, and use of ?smi-
leys?. This created specific problems for the PoS
tagger which assumes a more standard form of En-
glish. These problems were also compounded by the
noise introduced by typing errors and inconsistency
in spelling and capitalisation.
The experiment presented here exploits only one
possibility for the use of this technique. Other
prossible manipulations include; manipulation of
distance, in turns or time, between target and probe,
substitution of synonyms, hyponyms and hyper-
nyms, introduction of artifical turns, blocking of
certain forms of response. The important potential
it carries, particularly in comparison with corpus-
based techniques, is in the investigation of dialogue
phenomena which for various reasons are infrequent
in existing corpora.
5 Conclusions
The main conclusions we draw from the results pre-
sented here are as follows:
? Reprise CRs appear to go without response far
more often than might be expected, both in the
BNC and in our experimental corpus. Both
may be effects of the media (transcription in
one case, turn sequencing overlap in the other),
but the figures are large enough and similar
enough to warrant further investigation.
? Corpus investigation shows some strong corre-
lations between CR form and expected answer
type. It also shows that responses to CRs, when
they come, come immediately.
? Both word PoS category and first/second men-
tion appear to be reliable indicators of RF read-
ing. This can help us in disambiguating user
CRs, and in choosing forms when generating
system CRs.
? RFs generated on the first mention of a word
have a higher likelihood of receiving a response
than on second mention.
? We have presented a new experimental tech-
nique for manipulating dialogue, which we be-
lieve has many potential uses in dialogue re-
search.

Abstract
A key problem for models of  dialogue  is  to 
explain  how  semantic  co-ordination  in  dia-
logue  is  achieved  and  sustained.  This  paper 
presents findings from a series of Maze Task 
experiments  which are  not  readily explained 
by the primary co-ordination mechanisms of 
existing  models.  It  demonstrates  that  align-
ment in dialogue is not simply an outcome of 
successful  interaction,  but  a  communicative 
resource  exploited  by  interlocutors  in  con-
verging on a semantic model. We argue this 
suggests mechanisms of co-ordination in dia-
logue which are of relevance for a general ac-
count  of  how  semantic  co-ordination  is 
achieved.
1 Introduction
One of the first things apparent to European trav-
ellers on arriving at an American hotel is that the 
ground floor is also the first floor. Any confusion 
can  be  quickly  corrected  by  an  observant 
concierge,  whether  by explicitly  stating  the  con-
vention,  or  by  implicitly  bypassing  the  problem 
with  a  different  description,  such  as  ?go  up  5 
flights of stairs?. Assuming this description is suf-
ficient to guide the hapless traveller to the correct 
room, when the same traveller asks for assistance 
to find another part of the hotel, the concierge is 
faced with a choice of whether to give a descrip-
tion involving floor numbers or in terms of flights 
of stairs.
   The immediate  question that  emerges  is  what 
motivates  this  choice  between different  semantic 
models of a domain, how they are deployed when 
interlocutors  are  faced  with  problematic  under-
standing, and which semantic model is subsequent-
ly used once the problem is resolved. Although ex-
isting approaches to dialogue agree that answering 
this question necessarily involves focusing on the 
interactional  devices  available  to  interlocutors, 
their  primary emphasis  is  on the information-ex-
change  aspects  of  language  use.  Larsson  (2007) 
provides a useful distinction between the co-ordi-
nation  of  information,  i.e.  establishing  common 
ground (Clark, 1996) and the co-ordination of lin-
guistic resources which are adapted to suit particu-
lar communicative situations in order to make such 
information-exchange possible. Part of this frame-
work involves interlocutors negotiating which par-
ticular semantic model  to use, and adapting their 
own interpretations on the basis of successful/un-
succesful use.  However, although this framework 
sketches out a formal account of the mechanisms 
involved in this process, it is not concerned with 
predicting which particular semantic model will be 
adopted by interlocutors.
    A model of dialogue which attempts to address 
this  issue  is  the  interactive  alignment  model  of 
Pickering and Garrod (2004). In this model conver-
gence on a semantic model is arrived at via tacit 
priming  occurring  at  all  levels  of  representation 
(phonetic, phonological, lexical, syntactic, seman-
tic and situational): interlocutors are more likely to 
re-use  the  representations  used  by  their  partner, 
giving  rise  to  a  ?winner-takes-all?  dynamic  (cf. 
Steels  & Belpaeme,  2005)  which leads  to  align-
46
ment of interlocutors' representations. This is fur-
ther  re-inforced  by  ?percolation?  occurring  be-
tween levels, thus lexemes associated with particu-
lar semantic models will reinforce the use of these 
models.
     The claims associated with the interactive align-
ment model (henceforth IM) are drawn from a se-
ries of maze task experiments (Garrod & Doherty 
1994; Garrod and Anderson, 1987; Anderson and 
Garrod,  1987).  This paper discusses some of the 
original findings of these experiments and a further 
set of maze task experiments conducted by Healey 
and Mills (2006), Mills and Healey (2006).  These 
papers argued that the primary mechanisms provid-
ed  by the  IM are  insufficient  for  explaining  ob-
served patterns in maze task dialogue; in particular 
how  semantic  co-ordination  is  achieved.  The 
present paper argues that interlocutors in the Maze 
task exploit variation in usage in the service of se-
mantic  co-ordination.  Furthermore  we  argue  this 
suggests  mechanisms which are relevant for a gen-
eral  account  of  how  semantic   co-ordination  is 
achieved in dialogue. As the claims developed here 
are based on the maze task, we first  explain the 
task in more detail.  We then discuss a series of ex-
amples drawn from this task that raise basic issues 
for models of semantic co-ordination.
Figure 1: Example maze configuration. The solid 
black circle shows the player's current position, the 
cross represents the goal point that the player must 
reach,  solid  bars  the  gates  and  shaded  areas  the 
switch points. 
2 The maze task
The maze task developed by Garrod et alinvolves 
pairs  of  participants  seated  in  separate  rooms  in 
front of a computer which displays a simple maze 
consisting  of  interconnected   nodes  (see  Fig  1). 
Participants  must  move  their  respective  position 
markers  through  the  maze  in  order  to  reach  a 
?goal?  node.  Some  of  the  paths  are  blocked  by 
gates,  which  are  opened  by  participants  guiding 
each  other  onto  ?switch?  nodes  (shaded  areas). 
This  provides  participants  with  the  recurrent  co 
-ordination problem of collaboratively individuat-
ing  and  referring  to  maze  locations  in  order  to 
solve the maze. The descriptions used by partici-
pants to refer to maze locations are classified by 
Garrod et al into four distinct types:
Figural: Picks out salient features of the maze:
?The l-shape sticking out at the top?
?The uppermost box?
Path: Traces  a  route  along  the  connections 
between nodes:
?Go 2 up, 1 down, 3 along, 5 up?
?up, right, down, up ?
Line: Treats the maze as consisting of hori-
zontal or vertical vectors:
?3rd row, 5th box?
?4th column, second square?
Matrix: Cartesian co-ordinate system:
?4,2?
?A1?
It is assumed that these different description types 
correspond  to  different  semantic  models  of  the 
maze. 
3 Conservatism
The first question, also raised by Healey and Mills 
(2006),  concerns the tension between the interac-
tive alignment model's inherently conservative pri-
mary co-ordination mechanism and the migration 
in  description  types  commonly  observed  in  the 
Maze task.  To the extent that it relies on priming 
as its basic mechanism the IM cannot provide an 
account  of  how once a convention is  established 
and used successfully,  it  might  be supplanted by 
47
another.. However, it is consistently observed that 
the description types used most frequently initially 
fall into disuse and are not converged on in later 
games. Across trials there is a general shift from 
more ?concrete? (Figural and Path) descriptions to-
wards more ?abstract? (Line and Matrix) descrip-
tions, which runs counter to precedence. A typical 
pattern of the shift is given in table 1, below:
0 mins: The piece of the maze sticking out
2 mins: The left hand corner of the maze
5 mins: The northenmost box
10 mins: Leftmost square of the row on top 
15 mins: 3rd column middle square
20 mins: 3rd column 1st square
25 mins: 6th row longest column
30 mins: 6th row 1st column
40 mins: 6 r, 1 c
45 mins: 6,1
Table  1:  Semantic  shift  from  ?Figural?  and 
?Path? descriptions to ?Line? and ?Matrix? ob-
served in maze task dialogues.
Garrod (1999) discusses this process as an ?explo-
ration? process. However, this, in itself, doesn't ex-
plain the systematic patterns of change observed in 
the experiments.
4  Variation
The  early  explanations  of  co-ordination  in  the 
Maze  Task  also  emphasized  the  importance  of 
variation in the description types  participants are 
exposed to.  Garrod and Doherty (1994) assigned 
participants  to  one  of  three  different  groups:  (1) 
isolated pairs who always interacted with the same 
partner in subsequent games, (2) a sub-community 
group whose  members  changed partners  in  each 
game,  only  interacting  with  members  from  the 
same  sub-community,  and  (3)  a  non-community 
group  whose  members  always  interacted  with  a 
new partner  who  was  not  drawn  from the  same 
community.  Although  initially  pairs  in  the  sub-
community group were less co-ordinated than the 
isolated pairs, using a wider variety of referring ex-
pressions,  by the later  trials,  this  pattern was re-
versed:  participants  in  the  sub-community  group 
had converged on a single Matrix scheme and con-
sistently matched each other's descriptions.
   These findings present a problem for accounts of 
co-ordination which rely on priming, as they make 
the emphasis of the priority of alignment of repre-
sentations at all levels problematic.  The metaphor 
of two tightly-coupled production and comprehen-
sion systems is the paradigm case of successful co-
ordination, as it allows rapid priming between in-
terlocutors' representations.  However, these exper-
iments show weaker semantic co-ordination in the 
isolated dyads  than within the  group.  As  Garrod 
and Doherty (1994) concur, this implies that varia-
tion,  i.e.   differences  in interlocutors'  representa-
tions  is  important  for  establishing and sustaining 
semantic co-ordination.
5 Granularity of analysis
If variation of description types is intrinsic to the 
development  of  semantic  co-ordination,  this 
strongly  suggests  the  importance  of  mechanisms 
involved in dealing with problematic understand-
ing (Healey, forthcoming). All things being equal, 
variation increases the likelihood that interlocutors 
will encounter others whose use of language will 
differ more from their own. Further, any account of 
misunderstandings must also be able to address  se-
mantic  differences  between  descriptions:  partici-
pants in the maze task do not treat these four de-
scription types  equally, and consequently are not 
appropriately modelled as co-ordination equilibria 
of  the  kind  described  by  Lewis  (1968)  (Healey, 
2004;  forthcoming).  Existing  experimental  data 
shows that participants systematically favour Figu-
ral and Path descriptions when encountering prob-
lematic dialogue (Mills and Healey, 2006; Healey, 
1997) not the prior most frequently used semantic 
model as predicted by the IM.
 Looking more closely at the dialogues, it is not 
clear  that  the  co-ordination  mechanisms  actually 
operate directly at the level of the four basic se-
mantic models. Consider the following excerpt in 
which a participant  encounters difficulties with a 
Line description type  and its  associated counting 
conventions.   The  dialogue  continues  with  more 
Figural descriptions,  before resuming at turn (35) 
with a Line description:
48
(1) A: go to the 1st row 2nd on the right
(2) B: 2nd?
(3) A: on the right
(4) B: OK, I can only get to the left  of the 
maze
(5) A: go to the highest square on the left
(6) B: yes. And then?
......
(35) B: I'm on the top row 2nd square
Excerpt 1: Deletion of elements from problem-
atic turn.
While superficially, A's turn at (3) appears sim-
ply as a repeat  of  (1),  with ?on the right? being 
omitted, the subsequent turns continue with Figural 
descriptions. On this basis, it is unclear whether (1) 
and (3) invoke the same Line model or whether (3) 
invokes a Figural description. There is a large class 
of  similar  clarification  sub-dialogues  which  in-
volve deletion of a problematic element and result 
in the continuation of the dialogue with more Figu-
ral descriptions.
This issue is of  importance for any theory of 
semantic co-ordination as it raises the question of 
the granularity of the mechanisms involved in how 
interlocutors collaboratively change semantic mod-
el.  Further,  it  strongly suggests that  alignment  is 
not simply an outcome of successful communica-
tion, but can provide the background against which 
other  co-ordination  mechanisms  operate.  Turns 
(1)-(6) demonstrate high levels of between-speaker 
alignment, while at the same time involving a shift 
in semantic model. Before returning to this below, 
we demonstrate further differences between the in-
formational  view  of  language  and  an  account 
which focuses on semantic co-ordination.
6 Information vs. semantic co-ordination
From an informational perspective, if an utterance 
fails  to  secure  reference,  there  is  the  general  as-
sumption that more information will be provided to 
allow resolution of the problem. However, in (3), 
no  new information  is  provided by A.  This  is  a 
counter-example to  Clark  and  Marshall's  (1981) 
model of definite reference repair, which states that 
to be effective ?repair  must  add or alter  descrip-
tors, but not delete them?. Importantly,  these CR 
responses that simply delete elements from the tar-
get turn are not treated by participants as repeats 
and queried again, but appear to promote resolu-
tion of the problematic understanding by engender-
ing  the  use  of  more  Figural  descriptions.  The 
words which are omitted do not appear, as with the 
level of description types, to be dictated by prior 
frequency of  use  (Mills,  2007).  Instead,  the  data 
suggest  that  this  pattern is  motivated by a relax-
ation of the constraints of successful interpretation 
(Healey and Mills, 2006).
The  example  above  raises  a  further  question 
concerning the relationship between semantic co-
ordination and the exchange of information. In ex-
isting ?ladder models? of communication such as 
the collaborative model  of Clark (1996) and All-
wood (1995), there  is the general expectation that 
on encountering and signalling problematic under-
standing, interlocutors enter a sub-dialogue to re-
solve the problem, which on completion proceeds 
at  the  same  ?level?.  From  this  perspective,  B's 
turn-initial  acknowledgment at (4) should demar-
cate the end of the sub-dialogue dealing with the 
problematic  understanding.  Focusing  on  the  de-
scription types,  however, shows that it  is only at 
turn (35) that the interlocutors return to using the 
original problematic line description; the semantic 
effects persist beyond the immediate sub-dialogue. 
This highlights the inadequacy of a strict informa-
tional view of language as the response provides 
no additional information, yet still has the effect of 
resolving the misunderstanding.
7 Exploitation  of  alignment:  patterns  of 
deletion, modification and addition
In addition to deletion of elements contained in re-
ferring expressions, the maze task dialogues exhib-
it  a  multiplicity  of  ways  in  which  interlocutors 
modify descriptions when dealing with problemat-
ic understanding, through the addition, substitution 
and (as described above) deletion of elements of 
semantic models. We argue that alignment is key 
to these patterns of modification, as it provides a 
backdrop  against  which  changes  can  be  made. 
The canonical example of this is embedded correc-
tion (Jefferson, 1983; Saxton, 2007) which exploits 
the structure provided by alignment to make a fig-
ure / ground distinction that allows the corrected 
element to be identified:
49
(1) A: You need to go to the top of the 5th 
row
(2) B: I can't get to the top of the 5th line
Excerpt 2: Substitution of problematic ele-
ments .
Embedded corrections in the maze task exhibit 
very high levels of between-speaker alignment, yet 
occur at points in the dialogue where there is prob-
lematic  understanding.  This  indicates  that  align-
ment can not simply be reduced to an index of suc-
cessful communication. While this particular con-
versational device which spans  2 turns (and possi-
bly a third) has received much attention, closer in-
spection of  the  maze  task  dialogues  reveal  a  far 
larger space of possible means of exploiting align-
ment. Excerpt 1 above showed deletions, Excerpt 2 
substitutions,  however  a  similar  pattern  also  ap-
pears with the addition of Figural elements.
(1) A: I'm in the 4th row 5th square
(2) B: where's that ?
(3) A: The end bit
(4) B: cheers, I'm on the end bit right at the 
top
(5) A: can you get to my switch?
....
(23) B: am on the top row 3rd square 
Excerpt 3: Addition of ?Figural? elements.
At  a  first  glance,  this  excerpt  looks  like  a 
straightforward  clarification  request  followed  by 
the provision of more details,  specifying that  the 
?5th  square?  is  also  ?the  end  bit?.  B's  use  of 
?cheers?  in  (4)  and  subsequent  provision  of  her 
own maze location would appear to demarcate the 
end of the clarification sequence, as they  provide 
an acknowledgment and a ?next relevant contribu-
tion? (Clark, 1996).  However, focusing on the en-
suing turns yields a pattern that parallels the first 
example. The semantic effects stretch beyond the 
immediate  clarification  sub-dialogue:  both  inter-
locutors  continue  with  more  Figural  descriptions 
until turn (23) where the original, problematic Line 
description is attempted again.
   A further issue  emerges when interlocutors fi-
nally re-use the original description, as in turn (23) 
of Excerpt 1, and (35) above: although the surface 
form of the descriptions are similar, this does not 
necessarily entail that they individuate the same lo-
cations. For example, the counting conventions as-
sociated with squares may change, such as count-
ing from the left  instead of the right or counting 
from 0 as opposed to 1, similar to the concierge ex-
ample  above.  The  axes  may  also  change,  with 
?rows? referring to vertical vectors (i.e. columns). 
   This raises important questions of the relation-
ship  between  the  problematic  utterance,  the  sig-
nalling of the problem,  the response, the ensuing 
figural sub-dialogue and the subsequent return to 
the superficially similar but potentially altered de-
scription type. It appears that alignment is not sim-
ply  an outcome but an interactional resource that 
is exploited to facilitate the continuation with more 
Figural descriptions (cf. Saxton, 2007).
     In the first excerpt, turns (1) and (3) only differ 
minimally from each other, while in the second ex-
ample, turn (3) can be seen to be operating ellipti-
cally on turn (1). However, both engender similar 
semantic  shifts  towards  Figural  descriptions  and 
result in a return to the originally problematic Line 
description.
    This leads to the immediate question of what 
motivates interlocutors'  patterns of alignment and 
modification,  and how they reflect differences of 
understanding and diagnosis of  the problem.  The 
tacit and fine-grained nature of these modifications 
exacerbates the problem of arriving at a prelimi-
nary  taxonomy,  as  these  dialogue  sequences  are 
not readily categorizable as either ?elaborations? or 
?reformulations?  (cf.  Purver  et  al.,  2004, 
Schlangen 2004).
8 Boundary of (mis)communication
During the course of maze task dialogues, partici-
pants shift seamlessly and tacitly from one descrip-
tion type to another. This occurs both within prob-
lematic and unproblematic dialogue.  From an in-
formational  perspective,  miscommunication  is 
readily  describable  as  a  form  of  mismatch,  yet 
from  a  semantic  perspective,  participants  match 
each  other  more  when  encountering  difficulties. 
50
Thus alignment  cannot  be taken as a straightfor-
ward index of successful interaction. 
   This also raises a methodological point.  Mea-
sures  of  matching  of  representations,  whether  at 
the level of description type or its constituent ele-
ments are only an approximate index of semantic 
co-ordination. The excerpts above demonstrate the 
importance  of  the  interplay  between  what  is  re-
tained and what is modified. What is required is a 
measure that is sensitive to the kind of model being 
used and the kind of repair being performed. 
In addition, more frequent repair does not nec-
essarily entail that a dialogue is unsuccessful.  It is 
not the case that interlocutors introduce their utter-
ances carefully, and once they are sufficiently co-
ordinated,  move  on.  The  general  pattern  is  that 
when participants introduce abstract (Line and Ma-
trix) descriptions, they do so opportunistically. At 
the start of the games they frequently attempt both 
Line and Matrix descriptions, which are associated 
with higher co-ordination. However,  there is evi-
dence that it is only where they can go through the 
process of detecting and responding to differences 
in  usage,  i.e.  repair,  that  co-ordination  develops 
(Healey and Mills, 2006). 
   If the boundary between description types and 
also the boundary between successful and unsuc-
cessful use can be as porous as demonstrated in the 
excerpts above, this also suggests a more complex 
picture  of  referential  contraction  (Krauss  and 
Weinheimer, 1966) than provided by current mod-
els of dialogue. In current models this is primarily 
associated with successful use: in the collaborative 
model, interlocutors follow the principle of ?least 
collaborative  effort?  (Clark  and  Wilkes-Gibbs, 
1986), whereby successful use sets a precedent for 
an expression; co-ordination on precedence allows 
interlocutors to delete elements of the description 
on successive mention. It is assumed that the infor-
mation associated with these deleted elements that 
are no longer on the conversational surface can be 
re-accessed in the common ground and mentioned 
explicitly, e.g. to assist disambiguation.
    By contrast, the phenomena from the maze task 
show how similar  processes are operative during 
problematic  dialogue,  raising  further  questions 
concerning  the  difference  between  elements  that 
are removed in successful, as opposed to problem-
atic dialogue and where this boundary lies.
    Larsson's  model  of  semantic  co-ordination 
places a strong emphasis on the role of feedback in 
negotiating this boundary in terms of appropriate-
ness gleamed from feedback (e.g. repair, acknowl-
edgements etc..), and provides a schema which an-
alyzes the effects of novel uses of a word  and the 
subsequent update of interlocutors' representations. 
    Findings from the maze task experiments aug-
ment this approach as they suggest that  evidence 
of appropriateness is also derived in the absence of 
overt repair from semantic change alone. The ex-
cerpts  indicate  that  interlocutors  are  sensitive  to 
which particular tacit shift in model leads to a re-
laxation of the constraints on successful communi-
cation, and consequently can be exploited to indi-
cate problematic understanding (Mills, 2007). For 
example, consider the following two excerpts:
(1) A: It's on the 5th row 4th square
(2) B: Huh?
(3) A: The last square
(1) A: It's on the 5th row 4th square
(2) A: The last square
Excerpts 4, 5: Provision of feedback
If the dialogue continues successfully in both these 
instances, it is unclear how to adequately capture 
the  differences  between them,  in  particular,  how 
both patterns affect subsequent use of the descrip-
tion types,
     One of the main challenges facing an account of 
semantic co-ordination is teasing apart how inter-
locutors'  models  are  affected  by  both  semantic 
change exploited as a resource using the mecha-
nisms of alignment outlined above, and feedback 
concerning that change, as both aspects inhabit the 
boundary between successful and unsuccessful use.
   Evidence  from  the  maze  task  suggests  this 
boundary is one of the important locii in the devel-
opment of semantic co-ordination.
9 Semantic plasticity 
To describe  how interlocutors  dynamically adapt 
the meanings of the words they use to the commu-
nicative  situation  and  how  they  are  shaped 
throughout  the  course  of  the  dialogue,  Larsson 
(2006) introduces the notion of ?semantic plastici-
51
ty?. This model is sensitive to the fact that descrip-
tions  can involve a plethora  of  different  ?ad-hoc 
registers?,  which resonates strongly with the em-
pirical  phenomena  described  here.  However,  the 
data from all the maze task experiments presents a 
further problem for attempts to model  these phe-
nomena,  as successful  co-ordination on the more 
specific  abstract  levels  appears  to  be  predicated 
upon prior successful use of less specific Figural 
descriptions:  the  Figural  descriptions  are  highly 
specific to individual mazes and allow participants 
to co-ordinate on their salient features, whereas the 
Line and Matrix descriptions abstract  away from 
each individual instance to form dyad-specific con-
ceptualizations  of  vectors  and  their  associated 
counting conventions.
   While  Larsson's  account  highlights  the  sheer 
flexibility of ways in which linguistic resources are 
mobilized and adapted to particular interaction set-
tings, the data from the maze task suggest an addi-
tional level of complexity. Namely that the seman-
tic resources can not  be treated as separate, essen-
tially equal encyclopaedias that interlocutors draw 
on.  One way in which the cumulative shift  toward 
Matrix descriptions is achieved is by the combina-
tion of different ?registers? (Larsson 2007) to form 
a super-ordinate one.  Here the question concerns 
which specific features of each semantic model are 
included in the final one, in particular when there 
are problems of commensurability. For example, as 
table 1 shows, a common pattern in maze task dia-
logues is that approximately half-way through the 
dialogues  participants  use  ?Line?  descriptions.  It 
can  occur  that  they alternate  between describing 
the maze  as consisting of vertical  and horizontal 
vectors,  say with  one  participant  favouring  hori-
zontal  and  the  other  favouring  vertical  vectors 
(space considerations preclude a throrough exami-
nation of this process, described in Mills, 2007).  It 
frequently occurs that Matrix descriptions emerge 
when  these  two  different  Line  models  are  com-
bined to form a Matrix description. This process, 
however, is not as a rule simply a matter of com-
bining the two. Frequently, the two types of Line 
description employ different counting conventions, 
as in the example of the concierge above, giving 
rise to the problem of whether to retain different 
counting conventions for the different axes, or em-
ploy the same one.  The question then emerges as 
to how this super-ordinate, more abstract semantic 
model affects the original models.
  Results  from  the  maze  task  suggest  this  is 
achieved tacitly by interlocutors, employing simi-
lar patterns of modification to those described in 
the excerpts above (Mills, 2007).
10 Conclusion
The  phenomena  described  here  demonstrate  the 
need for an account of semantic co-ordination that 
explains how interlocutors converge on a semantic 
representation. Dialogues from the maze task pro-
vide  compelling  evidence  that  such  an  account 
must necessarily be able to account for how varia-
tion, and hence differences in semantic models are 
resolved. This approach necessarily involves shift-
ing the focus from an informational view of lan-
guage towards a focus on how interlocutors actual-
ly address these differences. 
      In a sense, this presents a reversal of the priori-
ties of existing models.  For the interactive align-
ment  model,  as  well  as  the  collaborative  model, 
misunderstanding is seen as a secondary problem 
that emerges as a complication of communication 
which  is  ordinarily  successful  (Healey,  2004; 
forthcoming).  The  collaborative  model  explicitly 
states that in order for communication to be suc-
cessful,  positive  evidence  of  understanding  must 
be demonstrated.  
    By contrast,  the view presented  here brings 
problematic understanding into the foreground,  as 
it  is  in  such  instances,  when  conventions  don't 
work as expected, that interlocutors gain a sense of 
their applicability. The phenomena presented here 
suggest that the processes operating in instances of 
misunderstanding are as much progenitors  of  se-
mantic co-ordination, as their  traditional counter-
part  of  displays  of  positive  understanding.  Inter-
locutors' separate interaction histories inescapably 
give rise to problems concerning the development 
and sustenance of mutual-intelligibility, intrinsical-
ly requiring interlocutors to resolve differences of 
semantic model  in interaction. The data from the 
maze task experiments  demonstrate how this can 
be achieved  through  tacitly modifying the  con-
stituents of  semantic models. This modification in-
volves the exploitation of alignment,  and has the 
effect of relaxing the constraints on successful un-
derstanding.
Any theory  of  dialogue  must,  in  the  first  in-
stance be concerned with what interlocutors actual-
ly do. The phenomena presented here demonstrate 
52
mechanisms  of  semantic  co-ordination  that  have 
previously fallen  under  the  category of  informa-
tion-exchange,  and  the  questions  raised  present 
rich  opportunities for further experimental investi-
gation.

Abstract
A distinguishing feature of dialogue is that
more that one person can contribute to the
production of an utterance. However, un-
til recently these ?split? utterances have re-
ceived relatively little attention in mod-
els of dialogue processing or of dialogue
structure. Here we report an experiment
that tests the effects of artificially intro-
duced speaker switches on groups of peo-
ple engaged in a task-oriented dialogue.
The results show that splits have reliable
effects on response time and on the num-
ber of edits involved in formulating sub-
sequent turns. In particular we show that
if the second half of an utterance is ?mis-
attributed? people take longer to respond
to it. We also show that responses to ut-
terances that are split across speakers in-
volve fewer deletes. We argue that these
effects provide evidence that: a) speaker
switches affect processing where they in-
terfere with expectations about who will
speak next and b) that the pragmatic effect
of a split is to suggest to other participants
the formation of a coalition or sub-?party?.
1 Introduction
Split utterances, defined simply as utterances
which are split between speakers1, are known
to occur in dialogue, as evidenced by Conversa-
1What we call split utterances have been variously re-
ferred to as collaborative turn sequences (Lerner, 1996;
Lerner, 2004), collaborative completions (Clark, 1996) co-
constructions (Helasvuo, 2004), co-participant completions
(Hayashi, 1999; Lerner and Takagi, 1999) collaborative pro-
ductions (Szczepek, 2000) and anticipatory completions (Fox
and others, 2007) amongst others.
tional Analysis (CA) studies, based on the anal-
ysis of naturally occuring dialogues. In addi-
tion to numerous analyses of split utterances in
generic English dialogues, there are cross lin-
guistic studies, and observations of conversations
with aphasics. In Finnish, split utterances within
a single clause conform to the strict syntactic
constraints of the language (which has a rich
inflectional morphology), despite the change in
speaker (Helasvuo, 2004). Similarly, in Japanese,
a verb-final language, speakers also engage in ?co-
participant completions? (Hayashi, 1999; Lerner
and Takagi, 1999). There is also evidence of
split utterances in conversations with aphasics
(Oelschlaeger and Damico, 1998), demonstrat-
ing that the phenomenon is pervasive in dia-
logue. However, with the possible exception of
Szczepek (2000) who analysed some 200 splits
from 40 hours of recorded English conversation,
these studies tend to be unconcerned with frequen-
cies of occurrence; that split utterances occur at all
renders them worthy of study.
Split utterances are a clear and canonical exam-
ple of coordination in dialogue. In order for one
person to continue an utterance which has been be-
gun by another person requires the hearer to have
coordinated with the initial speaker up to the point
at which they take over the role of producer2.
Analysis of split utterances, when they can or
cannot occur and what effects they have on the co-
ordination of agents in dialogue, is therefore an
area of interest not only for conversational an-
alysts wishing to characterise sytematic interac-
tions in dialogue, but also linguists trying to for-
mulate grammars of dialogue, and psychologists
interested in alignment mechanisms in dialogue.
2Note that this says nothing about whether such a continu-
ation is the same as the initial speakers intended continuation.
79
In this regard, studies of split utterances, in both
spontaneous dialogues and experimentally, as be-
low, provide a complementary way of studying
structural alignment to the traditional experimen-
tal set up exemplified by Branigan and colleagues
(Branigan et al, 2000; Branigan et al, 2003;
Branigan et al, 2006). Indeed, Poesio and Rieser
(In preparation) claim that ?[c]ollaborative com-
pletions . . . are among the strongest evidence yet
for the argument that dialogue requires coordina-
tion even at the sub-sentential level? (italics origi-
nal).
Broadly speaking, there have been two types,
or levels, of explanations of split utterances of-
fered; pragmatic accounts and processing ac-
counts. Pragmatic accounts are favoured by Con-
versational Analysts, with various aspects of split
utterances analysed. However, in line with CA as-
sumptions, these analyses are almost exclusively
concerned with the conditions under which split
utterances can occur. Lerner (1991), for ex-
ample, identifies a number of ?compound? turn-
constructional units, such as the IF-THEN con-
struction (whereby the second participant is in
some sense licensed to provide the THEN part of
the structure). However, Lerner?s insistence on
identifying the circumstances in which split utter-
ances usually occur misses the important general-
isation that, syntactically, they can be anywhere in
a string (his opportunistic completions). His claim
that an anticipatory completion is ordinarily ?de-
signed as a syntactic continuation of the utterance
part it follows at the point of onset?, seems to hold
for all split utterances.
The occurrence of split utterances also has im-
plications for the organisation of turn-taking, as
outlined in Sacks et al (1974). According to Sche-
gloff (1995), turn-taking operates, not on individ-
ual conversational participants, but on ?parties?.
For example, if a couple are talking to a third per-
son, they may organise their turns as if they are
one ?party?, rather than two separate individuals.
Lerner (1991) suggests that split utterances can
clarify the formation of such parties; ?collabora-
tively produced sentences reveal a relationship be-
tween syntax and social organisation. It provides
evidence of how syntax can be mobilised to organ-
ise participants into ?groups?.?
The processing approach towards split utter-
ances is exemplified by the interactive alignment
model of Pickering and Garrod (2004). They
claim that;
. . . it should be more-or-less as easy
to complete someone else?s sentence as
one?s own, and this does appear to be the
case.
(Pickering and Garrod, 2004, p186)
According to this model, speaker and listener
ought to be interchangeable at any point, and this
is also the stance taken by the grammatical frame-
work of Dynamic Syntax (Cann et al, 2005). In
Dynamic Syntax (DS), parsing and production are
taken to use exactly the same mechanisms, lead-
ing to a prediction that split utterances ought to be
strikingly natural (Purver et al, 2006). Addition-
ally, for a third person to process an utterance that
appears to come from two separate speakers ought
not be more difficult than processing the same ut-
terance from a single speaker, regardless of where
in a string the changeover occurs.
According to Poesio and Rieser (In prepara-
tion), ?the study of sentence completions can shed
light on a number of central issues. . . this type of
data may be used to compare competing claims
about coordination ? i.e. whether it is best ex-
plained with an intentional model like Clark?s. . . or
with a model based on simpler alignment models
like Pickering and Garrod?s.? As they see inten-
tions as crucial to dialogue management, they con-
clude that a model which accounts for intentions
(such as their PTT account) better captures their
task specific split utterance data (See Poncin and
Rieser (2006) for details of the German data they
are modelling).
If this is the case, it ought to be more difficult
to process an utterance that appears to be split
between speakers, as opposed to one that comes
from one source, because the intentions of the two
different agents have to be considered in arriving
at an interpretation, and they may appear to have
formed a ?party? with respect to the subject of the
utterance. Additionally it ought to be more dis-
ruptive to the conversation if the utterance is at-
tributed to someone other than the person who
genuinely contributed it, because the hearer would
falsely attribute intentions to the wrong interlocu-
tor. This ought to be especially clear in cases
where the ?conversational momentum? appears to
be with the ?wrong? interlocutor. Contrarily, if a
processing model such as the interactive alignment
model is correct, then no such differences should
80
be observed3.
To test these predictions, an experiment was set
up to alter genuine single-turn utterances into split
utterances at an arbitrary point in the string. Dif-
ferent types of intervention were introduced, in a 2
x 2 factorial design, in order to separate out the ef-
fects of an utterance appearing to come from two
different participants from effects caused by an ap-
parent change of floor.
2 Method
The effects of seeing an utterance split between
speakers or not were tested using the Dialogue
Experimentation Toolkit (DiET) chat tool, as de-
scribed in Healey et al (2003), which enables dia-
logues to be experimentally manipulated.
The DiET chat tool allows interventions to be
introduced into a dialogue in real time, thus caus-
ing a minimum of disruption to the natural ?flow?
of the conversation. In this case, a number of gen-
uine turns in a three way conversation were artifi-
cially split into two sections, with both parts either
appearing to originate from the genuine source, or
one or both parts being falsely attributed to another
participant.
2.1 Materials
2.1.1 The Balloon Task
The balloon task is an ethical dilemma re-
quiring agreement on which of three passengers
should be thrown out of a hot air balloon that will
crash, killing all the passengers, if one is not sac-
rificed. The choice is between a scientist, who be-
lieves he is on the brink of discovering a cure for
cancer, a 7 months pregnant woman, and her hus-
band, the pilot. This task was chosen on the basis
that it should stimulate discussion, leading to dia-
logues of a sufficient length to enable an adequate
number of interventions.
2.1.2 The DiET Chat Tool
The DiET chat tool itself is a custom built java
application consisting of two main components,
which will be outlined in turn; the user interface,
and the server console.
3This is, of course, an oversimplification, and note that in
contrast to pragmatic accounts, no claims are made regard-
ing higher level discourse effects of the split utterance, as the
focus is on the mechanisms which allow split utterances to
occur. Additional mechanisms could of course be posited in
processing models to account for any such differences.
2.1.3 User interface
The user interface is designed to look and feel
like instant messaging applications e.g. Microsoft
Messenger. It consists of a display split into two
windows, with a status bar, indicating whether any
other participant(s) are actively typing, between
them (see figure 1). The ongoing dialogue, con-
sisting of both the nickname of the contributor and
their transmitted text, is shown in the upper win-
dow. In the lower window, participants type and
revise their contributions, before sending them to
their co-participants. All key presses are time-
stamped and stored by the server.
Figure 1: The user interface chat window (as
viewed by participant ?sam?)
2.1.4 Server Console
All text entered is passed to the server, from
where it is relayed to the other participants, not
relayed directly between participants. Prior to be-
ing relayed, some turns are altered by the server to
create fake split utterances.
This is carried out automatically such that a
genuine single-person turn is split around a space
character near the centre of the string. The part
of the turn before the space is relayed first, fol-
lowed by a short delay during which no other turns
may be sent. This is followed by the part of the
turn after the space, as if they were in fact two
quite separate, consecutive turns. In every case,
the server produces two variants of the split utter-
ance, relaying different information to both recip-
ients. Each time an intervention is triggered, one
of the two recipients receives both parts from the
actual source of the utterance (henceforth referred
to as an AA-split). The other recipient receives
one of three, more substantial, manipulations; the
first half could appear to be from the actual ori-
gin with the second part of the split appearing to
originate from the other recipient (an AB-split), or
81
the inverse could be the case (a BA-split), or both
parts could be wrongly attributed to the other par-
ticipant (a BB-split). This design was in order to
separate the effects of a change in conversational
momentum (floor change) from the effects of split-
ting per se, hence the inclusion of the BB condi-
tion where who apparently has the floor is altered
without the utterance being attributable to differ-
ent participants. This contrast is shown in table 1.

B: start now A: start now B: start now
The intervention is triggered every 10 turns, and
restricted such that the participant who receives
the non AA-split is rotated (to ensure that each
participant only sees any of the more substantially
manipulated interventions every 30 turns). Which
of the three non AA-splits they see (AB, BA or
BB) is, however, generated randomly.
2.2 Subjects
41 male and 19 female native English speaking un-
dergraduate students were recruited for the exper-
iment, in groups of three to ensure that they were
familiar with each other. All had previous expe-
rience of internet chat software such as Microsoft
Messenger and each was paid ?7.00 for their par-
ticipation.
2.3 Procedure
Each of the triad of subjects was sat in front of a
desktop computer in separate rooms, so that they
were unable to see or hear each other. Subjects
were asked to follow the on screen instructions,
and input their e-mail address and their username
(the nickname that would identify their contribu-
tions in the chat window). When they had en-
tered these, a blank chat window appeared, and
they were given a sheet of paper with the task de-
scription on. Participants were instructed to read
this carefully, and begin discussing the task with
their colleagues via the chat window once they
had done so. They were told that the experi-
ment was investigating the differences in commu-
nication when conducted using a text only inter-
face as opposed to face-to-face. Additionally, sub-
jects were informed that the experiment would last
approximately 20-30 minutes, and that all turns
would be recorded anonymously for later analy-
sis. Once all three participants had been logged
on, the experimenter went to sit at the server ma-
chine, a fourth desktop PC out of sight of all three
subjects, and made no further contact with them
until at least 20 minutes of dialogue had been car-
ried out.
3 Results
A post experimental questionnaire and debrief-
ing showed that participants felt the conversations
went as smoothly as face-to-face dialogue. With
the exception of one subject, who had taken part
in a previous chat tool experiment and was there-
fore aware that interventions may occur, none of
the participants reported awareness of any inter-
ventions.
As production and receipt of turns sometimes
occurs in overlap in text chat, it is not possible
to say definitively when one turn is made in di-
rect response to another4. We therefore chose two
separate measures; next turn ? the first turn, by
the first recipient to start and complete a response,
after receipt of the intervention, and global ? all
the turns produced by both recipients between the
most recent intervention and the next intervention,
averaged to produce one data point per recipient
per intervention. This means that in the next turn
condition, only one datapoint is analysed for each
intervention, despite two different people seeing
an intervention (and both usually producing a re-
sponse). This was to try and isolate the initial re-
sponse to an intervention; for the other person who
saw a split but did not respond first, it is not clear
if they are responding to the split utterance, or to
4In online chat, participants can compose their next turns
simultaneously, and turns under construction when another is
received can be subsequently revised, prior to transmission.
This means that a genuine response to a split utterance might
have a negative start time. However, the inclusion of cases
where the whole turn was constructed after receiving the split
(an arbitrary cut-off point, which would catch some turns that
were responses to earlier turns in the dialogue, and miss some
which were begun before the intervention was received and
subsequently revised) should impose the same level of noise
in all cases.

the person who already responded to the split ut-
terance. In the global condition, in contrast, there
are two datapoints for each intervention (one for
each of the participants who saw a split utterance).
Of the 253 interventions to which at least one
recipient responded, 89 were AA/AB splits, 99
were AA/BA splits and 65 AA/BB splits. Table 2
shows the n values in each case.
Both next turn and global measures were anal-
ysed according to two factors in a 2 x 2 factorial
design; split ? whether both parts of the utterance
had appeared to come from the same person, or
from different sources ([AA and BB] vs [AB and
BA]), and floor change ? who appeared to have
produced the second part of the split, the genuine
source, or the other participant ([AA and BA] vs
[AB and BB]).
Measures selected for analysis were typing time
of turn (The time, in milliseconds, between the
first key press in a turn and sending the turn to
the other participants by hitting the return key) and
length of turn in characters as measures of produc-
tion; deletes per character (The number of keyed
deletes plus one (to prevent null values) divided
by the total number of characters) as a measure
of revisions; and typing time per character as a
measure of speed. Data in tables are displayed in
the original scale of measurement. However, as
inspection of the data showed that they were not
normally distributed, logarithmic transformations
(using loge) were applied to the data prior to all
formal analyses.
2 x 2 ANOVAs show a main effect of floor
change on the typing time of turn (see table 2).
This holds for next turns (F(3,249) = 7.13, p <
0.05) and globally (F(3,486) = 3.78, p < 0.05),
with participants taking longer over their turns in
the AB and BB conditions. There was no main
effect of split, and no effect of interaction. This
effect is greater locally than globally, with partici-
pants who respond first after seeing a floor change
condition taking more than 40% longer over their
turns than those who saw a non-floor change con-
dition. Globally the difference is in the order of
10%.
There was a main effect of split on the number
of deletes per character , which also held both in
the next turn condition (F(3,249) = 6.26, p < 0.05)
and globally (F(3,486) = 9.23, p < 0.05), with
subjects seeing a split condition (AB or BA) us-
ing fewer deletes per character than those seeing
a non-split condition (see table 3). There was no
main effect of floor change or interaction effect.
This effect is also stronger in the next turn con-
dition, with those not seeing a cross-person split
using over 50% more deletes. In the global condi-
tion, this difference is still 40%, though the overall
proportion of deletes is approximately 25% lower,
from 0.334 per character in the next turn condition
to 0.244 globally.

Additional analyses showed an effect of floor
change on length of turn in characters (table 4)
in the next turn condition (F(3,249) = 5.57, p <
0.05) such that turns are longer in the AB and BB
conditions (note that though this might be thought
to be confounded by the typing time of turn, as you
would expect longer turns to take longer to type,
there are no significant effects when ANOVAs are
performed on typing time per character). There is
no main effect of split, or interaction effect. In the
global condition, however, there is a main effect
of split (F(3,486) = 4.08, p < 0.05) such that turns
are longer after seeing an utterance that appears
to be split between two different people (AB and
BA conditions). There is no main effect of floor
change, and no effect of interaction.

As the experiment was looking for generic ef-
fects of splitting on coordination, the location of
the splits was random. A post-hoc analysis was
therefore carried out to ascertain whether the stan-
dalone coherence (as judged by the authors) of the
two separate parts of the utterance was a possible
confounding factor. Examples of coherence judge-
ments are shown in table 5.

2 x 2 ANOVAs showed that in the next turn con-

effect of first part coherence by second part co-
herence on deletes (F(3,249) = 4.05, p < 0.05),
such that if both parts are independently coherent,
or if neither part is independently coherent, there
are fewer deletes used in the turn immediately fol-
lowing the intervention (see table 6). There are no
significant global effects.

Running a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA with these ad-
ditional factors does not alter the main effects ob-
served for floor change or split, as detailed above.
There are no additional interaction effects on any
of the measures.
4 Discussion
As this is the first experimental study into split ut-
terances using the DiET chat tool, what follows is
necessarily exploratory. This discussion presents
our current hypotheses as to how best to interpret
the data, as summarised in table 7, below.
Table 7: Summary of significant effects

Floor Next Turn Typing Time
Change and Global (AB ?BB) > (AA ?BA)
Floor Next Turn Number of Chars

Taking longer over the production of a turn (in-
dependently of typing speed) indicates a lack of
confidence in the conversation (misattributing the
second part of the utterance thus reducing confi-
dence), and is also indicative of local organisation
of turn-taking. If a participant who has seen a floor
change intervention (Participant C) responds first,
then they may be taking longer over their turns be-
cause there is less pressure on them to take a turn.
This is because of the C?s expectations. They will
falsely believe that the fake source (Participant B)
has just completed a turn, and will therefore not
expect them to take the floor, and the genuine
source (Participant A) will not be taking the floor
because they have just completed a turn (though C
does not know this). It is probable that in the turn
immediately following a floor change intervention
both these factors are at play, whereas globally it
is the weaker effect of generic confidence loss that
is observed. This compounding of effects in the
next turn condition would also help explain the di-
vergent effects on the length of turn in characters
in next turn and global conditions.
Regardless of the precise reasons for it, this ef-
fect of floor change on typing time clearly demon-
strates that changing the apparent speaker is dis-
ruptive, perhaps because it alters the forward mo-
84
mentum of the conversation.
More interestingly, independently of a change
of floor, seeing an utterance that appears to be split
between speakers also has an impact on the con-
versation, seen in the amount of revision under-
taken in formulating a response (deletes). One rea-
son why participants might worry less about pre-
cisely formulating their turns following a cross-
person split is that the production of a cross-person
split could have the effect on the recipient of sug-
gesting that the two other participants have formed
a ?party? (Schegloff, 1995) with respect to the de-
cision of who to throw out of the balloon. This
might be understood as signalling the formation
of a strong coalition between the other two partic-
ipants, therefore making the recipient behave as
though they are resigned to the decision of this
coalition. This is not the same as the effect on the
typing time of turn, whereby participants are less
rushed when seeing a change of floor. Deletes, on
the other hand, demonstrate how carefully partici-
pants are constructing their turns. Excerpt 1, taken
from the transcripts shows an example where this
appears to be the case.
Excerpt 1 AB-Split showing apparent coalition
between ?Bhups? and ?Dan? (?fake? part of split
shown in bold)
Bhups: and he can tell his formula
Dan: to tom and susie
If we take split utterances as an indicator of co-
ordination then it is likely that if we believe our
two conversational partners to be in coordination,
we will worry less about precisely formulating our
own contributions. This also backs up the idea that
people are not interchangeable.
The interaction of first and second part coher-
ence also underlines the effect of split on revi-
sions as outlined above. In the case were both
parts of the split could potentially stand as inde-
pendent utterances, they are treated as such and
the number of deletes per character is in line with
the global average (i.e. they are treated as nor-
mal dialogue). In the other non ambiguous case,
where neither part could be interpreted as an ut-
terance on its own, there are also fewer deletes,
in line with the result that there are fewer deletes
in strong split cases. Interestingly, the most dis-
ruptive case is that where the first part could have
been a standalone utterance, but the second part
could not. This could be seen as analogous to a
garden path effect, and provides some indication
that that the building up of interpretations is incre-
mental, and not concerned with who supplies the
input.
These results do not, of course, prejudice the
claim that, at a purely mechanistic level, people
could anticipate the structures needed to complete
a turn, as the interactive alignment model sug-
gests, because they are not concerned with the ac-
tual production of a split utterance, rather on the
effect it has on the conversation. They do indicate
that in terms of the effects of seeing split utter-
ances, the pragmatic approach offers a more fea-
sible level of analysis. For example, if we wish
to treat a jointly produced split utterance as sig-
nalling especially strong alignment, then we need
to account for more than simply syntax.
There is an issue with the design of the exper-
iment which means that the floor change effects
might be caused by a confounding variable; in
essence, because one of the recipients always re-
ceived an AA-split, in the cases which have been
labelled as cases of floor change, the two recipi-
ents will have been left with the impression that a
different person made the final contribution. This
means that there may well be a an effect of con-
founded listener expectation (though see Schober
and Brennan (2003) for discussion), although it
should be noted that this does not have any bear-
ing on the observed differences after an utterance
split between speakers. It is also possible that
split utterances might be particularly marked in a
chat environment, though preliminary results of a
corpus study show that, perhaps surprisingly, split
utterances also occur naturally and as frequently
in text-based chat (Eshghi, in prep) as they do in
face-to-face dialogue (Purver et al, 2009). Be-
cause of these issues, and the already noted po-
tential problems of linearity in text-based chat,
a follow-up study using a character-by-character
chat tool interface is underway. This more directly
enforces turn-taking, as it does not allow partici-
pants to formulate their turn before communicat-
ing it; each character is transmitted as and when it
is entered.
5 Conclusions
The experiment reported here offers clues towards
an understanding of split utterances as an exam-
ple of dialogue phenomena, and provides evidence
85
that speaker switches affect processing where they
interfere with expectations about who will speak
next and that the pragmatic effect of a split is to
suggest to other participants the formation of a
coalition or sub-?party?. It also clearly demon-
strates that this type of experiment provides a fruit-
ful line of future research in the ongoing attempt to
adequately characterise dialogue, though further
developments are needed.
