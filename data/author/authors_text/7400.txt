Abstract 
We propose a treatment of 'extraposition' which 
allows items to be assimilated irectly even when 
they at)pear far from their canonical positions. This 
treatnmnt supports analyses of a number of phenom- 
ena which are otherwise hard to describe. The ap- 
1)roach requires a generalisation of standard chart 
i)arsing techniques. 
1 Extraposition in English 
It is widely accei)ted that sentences such as 
1 I saw the girl wh, o your tnvther said h,e fancied. 
2 The soup was OK, but th, e main course I th, ought 
was awful. 
involvc items ('who', 'the mai'a, eoursc') being found 
far away from their normal i)ositions (as the com- 
plement of 'fancied' and the subject of 'was a@d' ) .  
It seems likely that; the modifiers 'in the parle' and 
"with, all my heart' in 
3 l>n the park I met Arthur. 
4 I bclievcd with, all my heart th, at sh, c loved me. 
arc also 'out of position', since you would normally 
expect VP-modi(ying PPs of this kind to appear im- 
mediately to the right of the modified VP (so that 
the canonical versions of these sentences would have 
been '1 met Arthur in the park' and 'I believed that 
site loved me with all my heart.'). There arc vari- 
ous reasons for moving things around in this way- 
moving 'who' to the left; in (1) provides an easy way 
of l)icking out the boundary of the relative clause; 
moving 'the main course' and 'in the park' in (2) 
and (3) puts them into tlmmatically/informationally 
more prominent positions; and moving the senten- 
tial complement 'that she lovcd me'  to the right in 
(4) reduces the attachment ambiguity that arises in 
the alternative form. 
This is all well-known, and is treated in most 
grammatical frameworks by hallucinating an item in 
the canonical position, and then rememl)ering that 
halhlcination uI) to (;tie 1)oint at which the out-of- 
place item is encountered. Exactly how the halhlci- 
nation is remelnbered varies fron~ one framework to 
another, with Ulfification grammars generally carry- 
ing intbrmation about it on a category-valued fea- 
ture (usually called slash,). The main problem with 
this al)l)roach is that it is difficult to control the sit- 
uations in which 'traces' of this kind get proposed. 
(Johnson and Kay, 1994) suggest using ~sponsors' in
order to license the introduction of traces, where a 
st)onsor is some item of the required kind that has 
already 1)een found, and which is hence potentially 
going to cancel with the trace. 
If your parser works ti'om le f t , r ight  then this 
will work for items which have been left-shifted, but 
clearly it cmmot work for right-shifted items, since 
the sI)onsor will not have t)een found at the time 
when it is needed. Thus we cannot use a sI)onsor to 
justify hallucinatillg an S-comp ti)r 'believed' in (4), 
or for the heavy-NP-shifts in

gave up his job. 
built on that .spot th, e most appallingly ugly 
In any casc, the notion that some item has been 
left- or right-shifted fails to account for cases of 'in- 
traposition': 
7 I bclievc Betty is a fool. 
8 Betty, I belicvc, is a fool. 
9 Betty is, I believe, a fool. 
It is at least 1)lausible that (8) and (9) are variants 
oil (7). They're made out of the same words, they 
have the same truth conditions: the only trouble is 
that part of the sentence seems to be in the wrong 
t)laee. 
This is analogous to the situation in (2) and (3), 
where items were moved to the fi'ont to make them 
more prominent. It seems as though in (;tie current 
case the words 'I believe' have been shifted into the 
middle, and 1)arcnthesised, to nmke them less promi- 
nent. We will show how to deal with this by adal)ting 
663 
13 Charles danced with Eliza, but Diana he kissed. 
mid when we say that tim PP that results from satu- 
rating 'on' modifies a VP to its left we are referring 
to cases like (12), not to 
14 On the mat the cat sat. 
(or even 'On the mat sat the cat. ', where tile expec- 
tation that the subject will appear to the left of the 
verb has also been violated.) 
It seems as though we need the standard FRCP to 
cope with the canonical cases; the weakened FRCP'  
to cope with cases where the phrase occurs in some 
unexpected position; and something else to constrain 
the unexpected positions which are actually possible. 
Tile constraints on what can be moved around 
take two tbrnls. Firstly, we have say whether some- 
thing can be nloved at all, which we do by intro- 
ducing a polar-valued feature called moved: items 
which appear away from their canonical positions 
are marked moved(rioht) or moved(left), depend- 
ing on the direction in which they have been shifted. 
Arguments and targets which aren't allowed to move 
will be marked -moved by tile item that subcate- 
gorises for them. 
Secondly, we have to specify where those items 
that can move are allowed to get to. We do this 
by using linear precedence rules (LP-rules), most of 
which place constraints on immediate local subtrees. 
Thus we can say things like 
{A, B, C} : +wh@A&-wh.@B 
-+ start@A < start@B 
to capture tile fact that if A and B are local subtrees 
of C, then if A is WH-marked and B is not then 
A must precede B (A's start must be before B's). 
Note that the signature of the rule mentions C, even 
though in this case the body does not. 
The facts about extraposition are captured by 
rules which specify the circumstances under which a 
local subtree can (or must)be +moved. Tile key con- 
straints for trees representing structures with verbal 
heads are as follow: 
{ A, B, C} : -wh@A& -aux@C&A = snbject@C 
- moved@A 
(if A is the subject of C, where A is not WH-marked 
and C is not mi auxiliary, then A may not be moved) 
{A, B, C} : movcd@A = right 
~X(X  E dtrs@C 
& start@core@C < start@X) 
start@X < start(~A) 
(if A has been right-shifted, then C had better have 
some other daughter X between C's head and A. 
Tile flfll rule says that C must be heavier than X, 
where we take 'C is heavier than X'  to mean that C 
covers more words than X, so that tlfis rule covers 
(4), (5) and (6)). 
There are a nmnber of other such rules, of which the 
most complex relates to 'ttmt'-clauses (denoted by 
-~cornp). The description of such clauses comes in 
two parts, one to say that -~vh phrases may not be 
extracted and one to say that +wh phrases must be 
extracted. 
(i) {A, B, C} :C C clause 
& +comp@C & +compact@C 
---} - wh@B 
(ii) {A, B, C} : C C clause 
& +cornp@C & -compact@C 
--~ + wh@B 
The first part of this says that if combining A and 
B produces a 'that'-clause C, then if C is +compact 
(so nothing has been extracted from it) then it, had 
better be -wh  (in other words, nothing properly 
inside it can be +wh). If on tile other hand C is 
-compact hen there must be solnething extracted 
from it, in which case the item which has been ex- 
tracted must mark it as +wh,. These rules cover the 
(un)aeceptability of 
15 I know that she loves me. 
16 ~ I know me that she loves. 
17 who I know that sh, e loves. 
18 * I know that who she loves. 
5 I n t rapos i t ion  
The rules in Section 4 provide a reasonable account 
of simple extraposition (both left and right) from 
clauses. We now return to 
7 I believe Betty is a fool. 
8 Betty, I believe, is a fool. 
9 Betty is, I believe, a fool. 
Suppose we use FRCP' ,  with no LP-rules, to analyse 
(8). We will get, mnong other things, the phrases 
and part phrases shown in Fig. 1 (tile commas are 
treated as lexical items, so that 'Betty' starts at 0, 
the first comma at 1, and 'I' at 2, and so on). 
The first couple of steps are straightforward: 'a 
fool' results fl'om combining 'a' and 'fool'. It; has no 
holes in it, its extreme start and end are the stone as 
its compact start and end. Then 'is a fool' results 
froin combining 'is' and 'a fool', and again all the 
pieces are in the right place, so the extreme start 
and end are the santo as the compact start and end 
and the phrase is +compact. 
At step 3, 'Betty' is integrated as the subject of 
'is a fool'. The result starts at 0, since that's where

7 ,I believe Betty is a fool, 0 8 0 8

'Betty' starts, and is -compact ,  since it does not 
include all the intervening words. 
At 4 this -compact  sentence l)ecomes the com- 
plement of 'believe'. The result is again -compact ,  
since it fails to include the word q'  or the two com- 
mas which at)pear 1)etween its start and end l)oints. 
The compact core is now the word 'believe', so the 
comi)act start and en(t are 3 and d. 
.At; 5, the VP 'believe Betty is a fool' combines 
with 'I' to produce 'I believe Betty is a fool'. The 
two commas then combine with this phrase, mark- 
ing it as being parenthe.tieal nd, when the second 
comma is included, finally marking it as +compact. 
Similar structures would be created during the 
t)rocessing of (9), with the only difl'erence l)eing that 
'is a fool' would 1)e the first -corn, pact phrase found. 
Apart fl:om that the analysis of (9) would tm identi- 
cal to the analysis of (8). 
'i~hcre m'e two problems with this ai)l)roa(:h to sen- 
Ix'ames of this kind: (i) 1)ecause we obtain identical 
syntact i c  ana lyses  o f  (7),  (8) mid  (9),  then  any  (:Oln- 
t)ositional semantics will assign all three the same 
interpretation. This is not entirely wrong: I cannot 
fairly say a.ny of these sentences unless I do believe 
that Betty is a tbol. But it is also clearly not entirely 
right, since it misses the diflbrence in emi)hasis. We 
will not discuss this any further here. (ii) be(:mlse we 
are not applying the LP-rules, we get rather a large 
number of mmlyses. Without LP-rules, we gel; a sin- 
gle analysis of '1 believe Bctty is a fool', having con- 
structed 23 t)artial and complete, edges. 1,br 'Betty, 
I believe, is a fool' we get three analyses (including 
the correct one) having constructed 1.01 edges. Most 
of t, hese m'ise fl'om the t)resence of the commas, since 
we have to allow for the possibility that each of these 
(:ommas is either an ot)ening or closing l)racket, or a 
conjmmtion in a comma-sei)arated list of co l t iunets .  
Others arise fl'om the fact that we have removed 
all the LP-rules, so that we are treating English as 
having completely Dee word order. Case marking 
still provides ome constraints on what can combine 
with what, so that in the current case 'I' is the only 
possible sul)ject for 'believe' and 'Betty' is the only 
possible subject for 'is'. If we had been dealing with 
19 Betty, Fred believes, is a fool 
then we would have had six analyses froln 107 edges, 
with the new ones arising because we had assigne(1 
~Fred' as the subject of %" and 'Betty' as the sul)- 
jec~ of 'believes'. 
Clearly we need to reinstate the general LP-rule.% 
whilst allowing for the cases we are interested in. 
These cases are characterised in two ways: (i) some 
word that requires a sentence has oc(-urre(1 in ~ con- 
text where a :st)lit' sentence is available, and (ii) this 
word  is ad jaee i l t  to  a 1 )arenthet i ca l  comlna .  The  
statement of this rule is rather long-winded, but the 
result is to provide a single analysis of (8) from 66 
edges, and a single analysis of (9) from 70 edges. 
6 ~more X than Y'  
Most (:ases of extral)osition in English involve sen- 
tences, lint there are a numl)er of other 1)henomena 
where items seem to have 1)een shifted around. Con- 
sider for instance the following examples: 
20 Geo~ye ate more than six peaches. 
21 Harriet ate more peaches than pears. 
22 \[a'n, ate more pcaehcs than ,\]ulia.n. 
In (20), "more' than si:r' looks like a complex deter- 
miner. How many peaches did George eat? More 
than six. The easiest way to analyse this is by 
assmning theft 'more' subcategoriscs for a ' than-  
phrase'. 
In (21) and (22), however, the than-phrase seems 
to have become di@)inted. It still seems as though 
'more.' heads a complex determiner, since (22) would 
support the answer 'more than Julian' to the ques- 
tion 'How many peachcs did Ian cat?' a 
We therefore introduce lexical entries tbr 'more' 
and 'tha'n' which look roughly as follows: 
athough (21) does not seem to support  ~morc than pears' 
as an mmwer to 'How many peaches did Harriet cal'?'. The 
problem seems l;o be that NP complements  o 'than' are actu- 
ally elliptical (see below), and it seems to be harder to recover 
the elllpsed sentence 'More than she ate pears' than to recover 
~More than Julian ate peaches' or era, ore than Julian ate'.

The entry for 'more' says that it will make a specifier 
if it finds a satmated phrase headed by 'than'. The 
entry for 'than' says that it will make a phrase of 
the required type so long as it finds sonm argument 
X. We know very little about X. In (20) it is a 
number, in (21) and (22) it appears to be an NP. In 
fact, as (Puhnan, 1987) has shown, the best way to 
tlfink about these examples is by regarding them as 
elliptical fbr the sentences 
23 Harriet ate more peaches than site ate pears. 
24 1an ate more peaches than Julian ate peach, es. 
Other kinds of elliptical phrase are permitted, as in 
25 Keith ate more peaches than Lucy did. 
or  even  
26 Martha ate more ripe titan unripe pcach, es. 4 
We theretbre allow arbitrary phrases as tile argu- 
ment to 'than'. All we need now are the LP-rules 
describing when arguments of 'than' should be ex- 
traposed. These simply say that if you are combin- 
ing the determiner 'more' with a 'than'-phrase, then 
if the sole daughter of the 'than'-phrase is a nmnber 
then it must not be shifted, and if it is not then it 
must be right-shifted. 
(i) {d, B, C} : A E det&phon@A = 'more' 
& cat@B = than& dtrs@B = <D> 
& (DEnnmorDead j )  
4Note that  in this case the argument  of ' than'  is not  dis- 
placed.

(ii) {A, B, C} :A  E det&phon@A = 'more' 
cat?}B = than 
& not(dtrs@B = <D> 
& (D < . :am or D < adj)) 
--~ moved@B = right 
With these LP-rules, we get approl)riate structural 
analyses for (20) (25). We do not, however, cur- 
rently have a treatment of ellipsis. We therefore 
cannot provide sensible semantic analyses of (21) 
and (22), since we cannot determine what sentences 
'peaches' and 'Julian' are elliptical for (imagine, for 
instance, trying to decide whether 'Eagles eat more 
spar~vws than crows' meant 'Eagles eat more spar- 
rvws than crows cats sparrows' or 'Eagles eat more 
sparrows than eagles eat crows'). 
If the structure of 'more peaches th, an pears' in- 
volves a displaced 'than'-phrase, then it seems very 
plausible that the stone is true for 
27 Nick wrote a more elegant program th, an Olive. 
28 Peter wrote a more elegant prvgram th, an th, at. 
This is given further supt)ort by the acceptability of 
examples like 
29 A progrum more elegant han that would be hard 
to find. 
where tile 'than'-I)hrase is adjacent o the modified 
adjective 'elegant' rather than to the noun 'program' 
which is modified by the whole phrase 'more elegant 
than that'. 
Frustratingly, it just does not seem possible to 
reuse the lexical entry above for 'more' to cope with 
these cases. In (20) (25), 'more' made a deternfiner 
when supplied with an apl)ropriate 'than'-phrase. 
For (27)-(29) it needs to make somettfing whicll will 
combine with an adjective/adverb to produce an in- 
tensified version of the original. We therefore need 
tile tbllowing entry: 
) l ion ~more  ~ 
subcat sign < > J| 
semantics. . .  
668 
This needs a 'than'-phrase to saturate it, and once it 
is saturated it will combine with an adj (adjective or 
a(tverb) to nmke a new adj. There are two questions 
to be answered: should such a complex adj attpear to 
the left; or right of its target, and should the 'than'- 
phrase be extraposed or not? 
(28) and (29) show that these questions are in- 
timately connected. If the 'than'-phrase is right- 
shifted, then the resulting modifier aptmars to the 
left of its target (28); if it is not, then the moditier 
appears to the right (29). This is exactly what is pre- 
dicte(1 by (Willimns, 1981)'s suggestion that head- 
final moditiers generally appear to the left of their 
targets ( 'a quietly sleeping man') whereas non-head- 
final ones apt)ear to the right ( 'a 'llt(t'lt sleeping qui- 
etly'). All we need to do is to make right-shifting of 
the 'than'-l)hrase optional, and to invoke Williams' 
rule., using the coral)act core of the modifier. Thus 
the compact modifier 'more elegant h, an thai,' fl'om 
(2{I) is not head final, since the whole thing is cora- 
l)act but the head, 'elwant' , is i1ot; the last word; the 
non-colnt)aet one 'move ch;gant .. .  than that' from 
(28) is head final, since this time 'elegant' is the 
last, word in the (:ompact core 'more elwant'. Hetme 
'more clegant h, an that' tbllows its targe, t a.nd 'more 
clwant . . .  than th, at' precedes it. No new LP-rules 
are required, and 110 challg(}s 1;(1 th(} gellel:al rllle for 
locating moditiers are required. 
7 Conc lus ions  
\?e have shown how retrieving disl)laeed items di- 
rectly, rather than t)ositing a trace of some kind 
and then eancellillg it against an appriate iteln 
when one turns up, can I)rovide treatlllellts of left- 
and right-extraposition which display the advan- 
tages that (Johnson and Kay, 1994) obtain for left- 
extraposition. This approach to extraposition can 
be extended to deal with 'intraposition' and to cases 
where items have been extracted ti'om non-clausal 
items. In order to avoid overgeneration, we needed 
to introduce a set of LP-rules which are applied 
as phrases are constructed in order to ensure, that 
items have not been shifted to unacceptable posi- 
tions. The extra computation required for checking 
the LP-rules has no effect on l;he comI)lexity of the 
parsing process, since they simply add a constant 
(and t~irly small) extra set of steps each time a new 
edge is proposed. As a rough tmrformance guide, the 
gralnInar generates five analyses for 
30 Ite built on that site a more unattractive house 
than the eric which he built in Greenwich. 
on the basis of 237 edges (the different global anal- 
yses m'ise from the attachment ambiguities for the 
wn:ious modifiers), and takes 4.1 seconds to <1o so 
(compiled Sicstus on a Pentiunl 350). This sentence 
contains a right-shifted NP, which itself contains a 
'more ... than ...' construction and also a relative 
clause with a left-shifted WII-pronoun, and hence 
could be expected to cause problems for al)l)roaches 
using si)onsors , while 
8 Betty, I believe, is a fool. 
takes 0.27 seconds. Tit('. worst case comple?ity 
analysis for this kind of approach is fairly awflfl 
(O(l y) X 22(N-I)) where 1 ~ is the number of unsatu- 
rated edges in the initial chart and N is the length 
of the sentence (Ramsay, in press)). In practice the 
LP-rules provide sufficient constraints on the gener- 
ation of non-coral)act phrases for pertbrmalme to be 
generally acceptable on sentences of about twenty 
words.

Abstract 
C, omi)utational ai)proaches to reference resolu- 
tion, like Centering Theory, are best at resolv- 
ing referring expressions which denote familiar 
reD.rents. We demonstrate how, by t~king a 
proof-theoretic approach to reference resolution 
within a Centering-type framework, we are able 
to make sense of reti;rring expressions tbr un- 
familiar referents. These include, in addition 
to bridging descriptions, definite descripl;ions 
like "the first man" and "the first snowdrops of 
Spring". We claim that the first of these denotes 
a unique subset of a iflural discourse antecedent. 
While the second has no discourse antecedent, 
we similarly treat it as denoting a mfi(lue subset 
of a t'~nniliar eferent. 
1. I n t roduct ion  
Itow do reti;rring exl)ressions denote? Accord- 
ing to II.ussell, a definite description such as 
%he King of France", denotes a mfique individ- 
ual by virtue of its meaning. But, according to 
Familiarity Theory (Helm, 1.983), reti;rring ex- 
pressions need not denote mfiquely by virtue of 
their meaning as they refer to individuals made 
familiar by the discourse or other context. This 
observation plays a key role in Centering The- 
ory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al, 1995) 
and other computational al)t)roaches in which 
rethrring expressions are resolved by locating 
their antecedents in the discourse. The refer- 
ence of pronouns like "he", definite descriptions 
like "the woman", and referential tenses like 
"had" clearly has more to do with salience ill 
context thml with uniqueness of meaning. Sim- 
ilarly, while names like "Mary" need not denote 
individuals prominent in the discourse context, 
* \Ve would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for 
their detailed and helpful comments. 
they must nevertheless denote individuals famil- 
iar to conversants if they are successflflly to re- 
fer. However, there is another (:lass of referring 
expressions in relation to which we believe the 
concept of uniqueness of meaning does have an 
essential role to plt~y. These include such def- 
inite descrit)tions as "the first man" and "the 
first snowdrop of Spring", along with such vari- 
ations on these as "the first three men" and "the 
first snowdrops of Spring". 
In implementing a system of retL, renee resolu- 
tion, we have attemt)ted to reconcile the notions 
of familiarity mM uniqueness. This enables us 
to dereli;rence xl)ressions like "the first snow- 
drop of Spring" in a unified framework alongside 
anal)hers ~, pron(mns, retbrential tenses, names, 
and other definite descriptions like "the nlall". 
(1) Two men nrrive(t. 
(2) The .fir.st 'm,a'H, spoke. 
In the case of a referring expression like "the 
first mini", there may be an antecedent of sorts 
in the discourse, trot it is not the individual re- 
ferred to (or indeed ml individual at all). We 
will say that the antecedent "two men" intro- 
duces a set, and that the referring expression 
"the first man" denotes, by virtue of the mean- 
ing of.first, a unique subset of this familiar set. 
(1) Mary saw th, e first snowd,vp of 
Spring. 
In the case of "tile first snowdrop of Spring", 
there need be no explicit antecedent in the dis- 
course. We will s~w that, in the same way 
that "Mary" denotes a familiar individual, "the 
snowdrops of Spring" denotes a t'~nniliar set, or 
>vVe use this term to distinguish reflexives like "her- 
self" from t)ronouns like "he" and "hiln".

property. Again, by virtue of tile meaning of 
first, "tile first snowdrop of Spring" can be said 
to denote a unique subset of the familiar set. We 
will not claim that it denotes a unique individ- 
ual, but that rather it denotes a unique subset 
of the specified cardinality, i.e., 1. This treat- 
ment has tile advantage that it extends to plural 
referring expressions. 
Below we outline the approach we have de- 
veloped to the representation a d resolution of 
referring expressions, betbre discussing in more 
detail its extension to deal with unfamiliar ef- 
erents. 
2 A F ramework  for Re ference  
Reso lu t ion  
Our framework for reference resolution has been 
implemented in the system of language under- 
standing described in (Ramsay, 1999). The 
starting point tbr reference resolution is the log- 
ical tbrm we obtain fl'om parsing. For example, 
the tbllowing is the logical tbrm we get for the 
utterance "Mary slept." 
~A : { A is interval $~ 
f o,'e(,'e f ( aB ( V ech,_ti e( B , 1))), A ) } 
3C : {aspect(simple, A, C)} 
0 (C, agen.t, ref  (,kD (,,.amed(D, Mary) 
g card(D, 1)))) 
sleep(C) 
C is event 
We use tile inference engine described in 
(Ramsay and Seville, 2000) to update the dis- 
course model with a new discourse state con- 
taining the intbrmation explicitly represented in 
tile logical tbrm together with any further infer- 
ences which are licensed given the existing dis- 
course model. Reference resolution, which in- 
volves carrying out a proof that a retbrring ex- 
pression denotes, is implemented as part of the 
update step. We anchor a referring expression 
like ref()~D(named(D, Marg)&card(D, 1))) in 
tile discourse model by proving the existence of 
an entity in the model which satisfies the prop- 
erties specified by the referring expression, in 
this case aD(na,~ed(D, Mary)~ea,'d(D, 1)) 2. 
2Strictly speaking, it is a set which is denoted. For 
readability, our referring expressions conflate tim prop- 
erties of sets and their members. In this case, the car- 
dinality is a property of the set denoted, but the nmne 
Mary is a property of its member. 
Given that many referring expressions do not in 
themselves denote uniquely, however, we need 
a theory of reference resolution to enable us 
to obtain the appropriate (i.e., intended) ret- 
erent for any referring expression. We incorpo- 
rate our theory of reference resolution into the 
actual representation of referring expressions; 
for example, we label anaphors with the prop- 
erty "salient" and pronouns (and also referential 
tenses) with the property "centred"3: 
"himself" 
re f ( AX (salient (X, re f ( AD ( eds (D)))$~m (X))) 
"she  ~, 
ref (),X (ee..tred(X, reZ (),D(e&(D)  )~Z(X) ) 
Retbrence resolntion relies on maintaining, as 
in Centering Theory, a list of tbrward-looking 
centres for each discourse state (corresponding 
to an utterance) in the discourse. Furthermore, 
for the purposes of reference resolution, the dis- 
course states themselves are organized into a 
discourse tree, which is constructed automati- 
cally based on referential cues 4, as described in 
(Seville, 1999).

(1) a mani diedj in a park/~. 
(2) hei hadj been sleeping ther%. 
(3) a womanl lovedm him/. 
(4) shez had,~ hated him/. 
(5) he/ hadm hated himself/. 
(6) he~: hadm loved herl. 
The nodes in such a tree correspond to dis- 
course states. Those oll tile right-hand frontier 
are open, which essentially means that tile enti- 
ties mentioned in them are available to pronom- 
inal reference. 
The process of reference resolution for tile 
various referring expressions can be briefly de- 
scribed as tbllows. Anaphors, characterised as 
salient, are resolved to a less oblique argument 
of the same verb (Pollard and Sag, 1994) within 
the current discourse state, which is constructed 
aHere rcf(AD(cds(D)) is a reference to the current 
discourse state and the properties m and f refer to male 
and female gender espectively. 
4The tree illustrated was constructed using pronomi- 
nal cues. Each discourse state was attached as a daugh- 
ter of the highest node in the discourse tree to which all 
pronouns and referential tenses (like had) mentioned in
it could be anchored. 
776 
incrementally. We also st;art our sere'oh tbr the 
referents of prononns and other centred enti- 
ties in the current disconrse state, which is nec- 
essary if we are to resolw; such referring ex- 
pressions as "her" in "Mary took John with 
her." However, referring expressions contain- 
ing the property centred are prevented front 
1)eing dereferenced to salient entities, thus en- 
suring that the constraint of disjoint reference 
is met. If we fail to tind the centred en- 
tity in the current discourse state, we search 
the previous open node and, if necessary, fllr- 
ther open nodes in the discourse tree, in order 
to deal with long-distance pronominalisation. 
The dereferencing of other referring expressions 
like ref(AD(named(D, Mary)gcard(D, 1))) is 
similar but less constrained in that we con- 
sider entities mentioned in all nodes mentioned 
in the discourse, tree, whether open or closed, 
in order of recency. This means that, essen- 
tially, names and definite descriptions are deref- 
created to the most recently mentioned refer- 
ent which is appropriate. Unlike in the case of 
pronouns, we also consider Discourse State 0, 
which doesn't correspond to an utterance but, 
rather, contains the background knowledge as- 
stoned in the model. This is how we are able 
to deal with the first mention of a familiar 
referent like Mary (assmning that the proper- 
ties kD(na, m(:d( D, Mary)gcard( D, 1)) sumce 
to distinguish a particular entity in Discourse, 
State 0 from all the others). 
Our approach extends naturally to cases like 
%he first snowdrop of Spring" because it; is 
proof-theoretic and so able to exploit back- 
ground knowledge in reference resolution. This 
can be illustrated, in the first instance., by exam- 
thing the backgrmmd knowledge which is used 
in updating the utterance "Mary slept." The 
update step for this utterance yields Discourse 
State 1, contailfing (amongst others) the tbllow- 
ing facts:

,s/eep(#134) 
0(#134, agent, #94) 
ends_before(#4(1), #133) 
aspect(simple, #13a, #134) 
We were able to prove named(#94, Mary) 
and card(#94, 1) and so dereference 
rcf(,\D(namcd(D, Mary)&card(D, 1))) as 
the tbllowing were amongst he t~cts contained 
in Discourse State 0: 
Discourse State 0 
female(#94) 
named(#94, Mary) 
woman(#94) 
f(#.94) 
card(#94, 1) 
adult(#94) 
These were generated from the lexical memfing 
1)ostulates we stipulated for "Mary", "woman", 
and " fo lna le"  :
3X (namcd( X, Mary)&woman( X)&card( X, 1)) 
VX(woman(X) 
VX(.fcmalc(X) -4 f(X)) 
3 Unfami l ia r  Re ferents  
In this section we show how, within the frame- 
work above, we are able to make sense of a vari- 
ety of referring expressions denoting unfamiliar 
referents. The most straighttbrward of these are 
bridging descriptions, so we start with these. 
3.1 Br idging Descr ip t ions  
(1) Mary loves her" moth, or. 
In this first case, "her mother", contains a refer- 
ring expression ested within it;. Having deref- 
erenced this, the knowledge that moth, er of is a 
fllnction enables us to obtain a unique reli;renl;. 
Our representation of the referring expression 
to be derelbrenced is as follows: 
"her mother" 
ref(AB(of(B, 
,.e f ( a, 1) 
$~ f(G)))) 
ca .d( B, 1))) 
Tile first step involves anchoring tile referring 
expression by dereferencing its nested rethrring 
expression for "her ''5. 
'SThe referent for this is characterised as 
salient_or_centred as we allow I)ossessivc pronouns 
to be dereferenced as anal)hers or, failing that, as 
pronouns. 
777 
Current Model 
ends_at_or_after(#4(1), #135) 
aspect(simple, #135, #136) 
0(#136, agent, #94) 
Zove(#la6) 
Tile partially constructed current discourse 
state we have when we do our dereferencing is as 
shown. "Mary" has already been dereferenced 
to #94 and this has been entered into the list 
of forward-looking centres fbr the current utter- 
ance. We are able to prove both salient(#94) 
and f (#94) ,  and so our nested referring expres- 
sion is dereibrenced to this entity. 
ref(kB(of(B, 
, F(,,,other( F) ), 
#94) 
card(m1))) 
It is then a straighttbrward matter to derefer- 
ence the anchored referring expression, given 
the tbllowing facts in Discourse State 0: 
Discourse State 0 
mother (#60 (#94)) 
o f (#60(#94) ,  ;~A(moth.cr(A)), #94) 
f (#60(#94)) 
card(#60(#94), 1  
These derive from our nmaning postulates fbr 
"mother ''6 and "of": 
VX( (X  is a,~i.,o,O~card(X , 1) --~ 
~Y (o.f (Y, kZ (rnother( Z) ), X) 
&card(Y, l)&f(Y))) 
VXVYVZ(of(X, Y, Z) -+ Y.X) 
Dealing with other bridging descrit)tions is 
more complicated: 
(1) Mary saw a house. 
(2) She tbund the door. 
In order to give an analogous treatment to the 
referring expression "the door", we have to treat 
it as elliptical tbr an exl)ression containing a 
nested referring expression, i.e., "the door of the 
house". In the same way that we have a mean- 
ing postulate for the relation mother of, we have 
one for the relation door of: 
aSkolemization preserves dm dependency of Y on X, 
i.e., #94 is present in #60(#94). 
vx((ho,, e(x) v car(X)) 
qY (of (Y, AZ(door( Z) ), X)~eard(Y, 1))) 
This means that, having used utterance (1) 
above to update the discourse model, we have 
the fbllowing amongst the facts in Discourse 
State 1: 
Discourse State 1 
seel(#138) 
0(#138, agent, #94) 
0(#138, object, #139) 
card(#139, 1)
house( #139) 
ends_be for'e(#4(1), #sat )  
door(#46(#139)) 
entrance( #46( #139 ) ) 
of(#46(#139),  ~d(door'(A)), #139) 
card(#46(#139),  1  
aspect(simple, #137, #138) 
In updating utterance (2), the bridging descrip- 
tion which needs to be dereDrenced has the tbl- 
lowing representation: 
ref(AE(door(E) g~ card(E, 1))) 
Since we caimot guarantee that there will only 
be a single entity in our model satisfying the 
t)roperties kE(door(E) & card(E, 1)), we want 
to ensure that the referent we obtain is either 
the most recently mentioned or that with the 
most recently mentioned antecedent, i.e., in this 
case, the house #139. Our ret>rence resolu- 
tion t)rocedure xploits the fact that the house, 
#139, is explicitly represented in the forward 
looking centres of Discourse State 1 and that 
the intended referent, #46(#139), is clearly a 
flmction of this (its dependency having been 
preserved by Skolemization). In considering the 
potential refbrents for our referring expression ill
order of recency, we attempt o prove, not sim- 
ply, ibr each referent, X, whether door(X) and 
car'd(X, 1), but door(V) and card(Z, 1) where 
Y is a function of X. Since #46(#139) is 
a function of the antecedent #139, we obtain 
the appropriate referent in this case by proving 
door(#46(#139)) and card(#46(#139), 1 . 
3.2 Superlatives 
We are now in a I)osition to describe our treat- 
ment of the superlatives discussed in the intro- 
duction. First, we consider a case in which there 
is a discourse antecedent of sorts: 
778 
(1) Two men arrived. 
(2) The first man spoke. 
Discom:se State 1 contains the tbllowing facts: 
Discourse State 1 
arrive( #107) 
0(#107, agent, #1.08) 
card(#108, 2)
man(#108) 
male(#108) 
.~(#108) 
adult(#108) 
~n&_b<l'o,'d #4(1), #106) 
a.s'pect(.simplc, #106, #107) 
Our representation of the referring exi)ression 
"the first man" is as follows: 
rcf(k\]3('mo,st(B, 
~C(early( C, AD(man(D)))), 
,.~f (~E(,,,o,,,,(~)))) 
x~ ,-..,.d(u. 1)))) 
The nested referring expression 
ref(AE('m,a,'n.(E)))) ('m~ be straightforwardly 
dereferenced in this case to give the anchored 
refi;rring exl)ression: 
rcf(A\]3(mo,st(B, 
ac(,.~,,+.,j( c, .xu(,..,.~(J))))), 
#108) 
g ,..,,,,,.d(J3, ~)))) 
Dereferencing this then involves our meaning 
postulate fi)r superlatives: 
VXVZVC(,-,,,,.d(Z, C)~(Z - X)~(~C = 1),~ 
V NV P (-wnosl.( X, P, _) -+ 
~Y (mosl,(Y, P, X)&card(Y, N)))) 
This siml)ly says that tbr any severalton set X, 
any property 1 ) and any N, there is some set Y 
containing the N "most P" members of X. This 
meaning postulate does not translate into any 
facts in Discourse State 0, lint remains as a rule. 
When we have a particular eferring expression 
to derefhrence, this rule enables us to prove that: 
most(#81(kA(early(A,...)), 1, 2, #108, #108), 
,x ( c ( ~,~,.ly( c, ~D ( .,,,,,.,( D ) ) ) ), 
#108) 
card(#81 (AA(c'arly (A, . . . ) ) ,  1, 2, @ 108, @ 108), 
1) 
In this way, we prove that the referring ex- 
pression makes sense, i.e., denotes. However, 
unlike in the previous cases, we do not deret- 
erence to a familiar referent. There are no 
existing facts in the database about the ref- 
erent #81(AA(early(A,...)), 1, 2, @108, #108). 
Instead, in this case, we have to add to Dis- 
course State 2 the facts we have proved. 
Discourse state 2

~,,~.d(#Sl(~A(~o,,@(A,...)), 1, 2, #108, #108),

,,d,,,U,(#Sl(~A(~,,@(A,...)), 1, 2,#108, #108)) 
The fln:ther facts we. prove, about our refe.rent 
being e~rly, male, etc., are required if we are to 
be aMe to subsequently retb.r to it using referring 
expressions such as "he". The.se are generated 
from a set of associated memfing postulates: 
VXVYVP((ordered(P)~most(Y, P, X)) -+ P.Y) 
V A ( ordered( AB (early( B, A)))) 
vxvP(,.~o,,.1,,(x, 1,) -~ p.x) 
VX ('m, an( X) 
(X is h, uman)~male(X)&adult(X)) 
vx(mde(x)  -~ re(x)) 
In addition to these, we have two further mean- 
ing postulates for superlatives: 
vxvYvevcvz( , , .o~t(Y ,  1; X),~a,.d(Y, C) 
g,,,os~,(Z, P, X)*~a,.d(Z, C) 
-~z=Y) 
VXVI'VYVNVC(most( X, P, Z)& 
card(X, N)~card(V, C) 
-~ ~,~o,.~( N, C) ) 
779 
The first of these, the uniqueness meaning pos- 
tulate, states that if there are two subsets of of 
a set which share the same cardinality mid the 
same superlative property, such as first, then 
they must be regarded as identical 7. The sec- 
ond simply ensures that any mffamiliar ret5r- 
ent which we obtain via our meaning postu- 
lates can sensibly regarded as a proper subset 
of its antecedent; hat is, it prevents us regard- 
ing "two men" as a potential antecedent of "the 
first men": 
(1) Two meni arrived. 
(2) The first men,f(i) spoke. 
Our treatment of superlatives without dis- 
course antecedents is similar to that above. 
(1) Mary saw th, c first snow&vps of 
Spring. 
There is just one major difference. 
r' I( E 
AF(carly(F, 
: a(of(a, 
,\It(snowdrop(It)), 
re f ( ),I(named( I, 
@ri..o) 
g  rd(Z, 1))))))), 
ref(),J(of(J, 
( s o.odrop( K) ), 
re f ( kL(named( L, Spring) 
&card(L, 1))))))) 
E, VO ) ) ) 
The representation we obtain for the referring 
expression "the first snowdrops of Spring" is 
shown above. Like that for "the first man", this 
contains a nested referring expression: 
ref(),g(of(J, 
AK ( snowdrop( K) ), 
~card(L, 1))))))) 
The difference is that, in this case, there is 
no discourse antecedent for the nested refer- 
ring expression. This means that, in order to 
7practicaUy, this meaning postulate seems to be re- 
dundant. Our meaning postulates generate for us only 
one such subset and it is impossible for another to be 
introduced through the discourse as "a first man" is un- 
grammatical. 
anchor our referring expression by dereferenc- 
ing the referring expression ested within it, we 
need to introduce a meaning postulate for the 
nested referent (and one for its nested referent, 
Spring): 
3X ( X, rd( X, 1)) 
qX(of(X, 
) ) ) 
&card(X, pl) ) 
These meaning postulates simply introduce into 
Discourse State 0 the fact that there are snow- 
drops of Spring, in the same way that the mean- 
ing postulate for "Mary" introduced the fact 
that there is a singleton set containing an in- 
dividual so named.

Given the above facts in Discom'se State O, an- 
choring our referring expression is straighttbr- 
ward. 
f ( E(. ost( E, 
1F(early(F, 
 C(of(a, 
Mt (.snowdrop( H) ), 
#98)))), 
#101) 
* car'd(E, P0))) 
From this point onwards, the proof that this 
referring expression denotes proeeeeds in the 
same way as in the previous example. Given 
the meaning postulates for superlatives, we are 
able to prove: 
most(#81(),A(early(A,...)),pl,pl, #101, #101), 
~D(early(D, 
)~E (o f ( E, )~F (snowdroI,( F) ) , #98)))), 
#101) 
card(#81(~A(ear' ly(A, . . . ) ) ,p l ,pl ,  #101, #101), 
pl) 
780 
Again, as in the example above, the facts we 
have proved concern an nut~miliar referent, and 
so have to 1)e added to the current discourse 
state.

4 Conc lus ion  
We have shown how, l)y taking a t)root:theoretie 
approach to reference resolution, we can extend 
a Centering-tyt)e framework to make sense of 
tel!erring expressions for a w~riety of unfamiliar 
referents. Having made sense of such referring 
ext)ressions, we add their referents to our dis- 
course model. This is how we would normally 
deal with indefinites rather than definites. How- 
ever, this al)t)roach makes t)erfect sense, given 
our treatment of su('h referring exl)ressions as 
denoting unfamiliar subsets of familiar referents 
(regarded as sets). We claim that we are able 
to use definite descriptions to refer to the ref- 
erents in question, despite their unfamiliarity, 
SO long as we Call prove that, by virtue of their 
meaning, they denote uniqnely. 
Having imt)lemented our approach in a sys- 
tem of language understanding which already 
deals with a wide variety of referring expres- 
sions, we have demonstrated its practicality. 
It also has interesting theoretical implications, 
since it suggests a way in which pragmatic theo- 
ries of reference resolution, like Familiarity The- 
ory, and semantic theories, like Russell's, may 
be reconciled. However, it is fair to say that 
the success of the approach is not yet proven. 
This is because we have yet to show that we 
can deal with a set of related referring expres- 
sions within a single fi'amework. The following 
example illustrates the kinds of cases we have 
in mind: 
(1) Three meni ate. 
(2) Two menj slept. 
(3) The first meni died. 
Here, "first" in "the first men" is clearly per- 
tbrming a dit\[erent, discourse-related flmction 
from that it p lws in the cases we have been 
considering. We have yet to tackle such difficult 
cases but, since they seem to require reasoning 
about sets, we believe that our inference-based 
approach to reference resolution is a good place 
to start.
