Abstract
Theories of human language acquisition as-
sume that learning to understand sentences is
a partially-supervised task (at best). Instead
of using ?gold-standard? feedback, we train
a simplified ?Baby? Semantic Role Labeling
system by combining world knowledge and
simple grammatical constraints to form a po-
tentially noisy training signal. This combina-
tion of knowledge sources is vital for learn-
ing; a training signal derived from a single
component leads the learner astray. When this
largely unsupervised training approach is ap-
plied to a corpus of child directed speech, the
BabySRL learns shallow structural cues that
allow it to mimic striking behaviors found in
experiments with children and begin to cor-
rectly identify agents in a sentence.
1 Introduction
Sentence comprehension involves assigning seman-
tic roles to sentence constituents, determining who
does what to whom. How do young children be-
gin learning to interpret sentences? The structure-
mapping view of early verb and syntax acquisition
proposes that children treat the number of nouns
in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate-
argument structure (Fisher, 1996), and represent lan-
guage experience in an abstract format that promotes
generalization to new verbs (Gertner et al, 2006).
Theories of human language acquisition assume
that learning to understand sentences is naturally
a partially-supervised task: the fit of the learner?s
predicted meaning with the referential context and
background knowledge provides corrective feed-
back (e.g., Pinker (1989)). But this feedback must
be noisy; referential scenes provide ambiguous in-
formation about the semantic roles of sentence par-
ticipants. For example, the same participant could
be construed as an agent who ?fled? or as a patient
who is ?chased?.
In this paper, we address this problem by de-
signing a Semantic Role Labeling system (SRL),
equipped with shallow representations of sentence
structure motivated by the structure-mapping ac-
count, that learns with no gold-standard feedback at
all. Instead, the SRL provides its own internally-
generated feedback based on a combination of world
knowledge and linguistic constraints. As a sim-
ple stand-in for world knowledge, we assume that
the learner has animacy information for some set of
nouns, and uses this knowledge to determine their
likely roles. In terms of linguistic constraints, the
learner uses simple knowledge about the possible ar-
guments verbs can appear with.
This approach has two goals. The first is to in-
form theories of language learning by investigating
the utility of the proposed internally-generated feed-
back as one component of the human learner?s tools.
Second, from an NLP and Machine Learning per-
spective we propose to inject information into a su-
pervised learning algorithm through a channel other
than labeled training data. From both perspectives,
our key question is whether the algorithm can use
these internally labeled examples to extract general
patterns that can be applied to new cases.
By building a model that uses shallow representa-
tions of sentences and minimal feedback, but that
84
mimics features of language development in chil-
dren, we can explore the nature of initial representa-
tions of syntactic structure.
1.1 Background
The structure-mapping account of early verb and
syntax acquisition makes strong predictions. First,
it predicts early use of simple structural cues to sen-
tence interpretation. As soon as children can iden-
tify some nouns, they should assign different in-
terpretations to transitive and intransitive sentences,
simply by assuming that each noun in the sentence
bears a distinct semantic role. Similarly, language-
specific syntactic learning should transfer rapidly to
new verbs. Second, however, this account predicts
striking errors. In ?Fred and Ginger danced?, an
intransitive verb occurs with two nouns. If chil-
dren interpret any two-noun sentence as if it were
transitive, they should mistakenly interpret the order
of two nouns in such conjoined-subject intransitive
sentences as agent-patient. Experiments with young
children support these predictions. 21-month-olds
use the number of nouns to understand sentences
containing new verbs (Yuan et al, 2007), generalize
what they have learned about transitive word-order
to new verbs (Gertner et al, 2006), and make the
predicted error, treating intransitive sentences con-
taining two nouns as if they were transitive (Gert-
ner and Fisher, 2006). By 25 months, children have
learned enough about English syntax to interpret
conjoined-subject intransitives differently from tran-
sitives (Naigles, 1990).
Our previous computational experiments with a
system for automatic semantic role labeling (Con-
nor et al, 2008) suggest that it is possible to learn
to assign basic semantic roles based on the simple
representations proposed by the structure-mapping
view. The classifier?s features were limited to lexical
information (nouns and verbs only) and the number
and order of nouns in the sentence, and trained on a
sample of child-directed speech annotated in Prop-
Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) style. Given
this training, our classifier learned to label the first
of two nouns as an agent and the second as a patient.
Even amid the variability of casual speech, simply
representing the target word as the first or the second
of two nouns significantly boosts SRL performance
(relative to a lexical baseline) on transitive sentences
containing novel verbs. This result depends on key
assumptions of the structure-mapping view, includ-
ing abstract representations of semantic roles, and
abstract but simple representations of sentence struc-
ture. Another approach was taken by (Alishahi and
Stevenson, 2007). Their model learned to assign se-
mantic roles without prior knowledge of abstract se-
mantic roles. Instead, it relied on built-in syntactic
knowledge and a rich hierarchical representation of
semantic knowledge to learn links between sentence
structure and meaning.
However, our previous experimental design has
a serious drawback that limits its relevance to the
study of how children learn their first language.
In training, our SRL received gold standard feed-
back consisting of correctly labeled sentences. Thus
when the SRL made a mistake in identifying the se-
mantic role of any noun in a sentence, it received
feedback about the ?true? semantic role of this noun.
As noted above, this is an unrealistic assumption for
the input to human learners.
Here we ask whether an SRL could learn to in-
terpret simple sentences even without gold-standard
feedback by relying on world knowledge to gen-
erate its own feedback. This internally-generated
feedback was based on the following assumptions.
First, nouns referring to animate entities are likely
to be agents, and nouns referring to inanimate en-
tities are not. Second, each predicate takes at most
one agent. Such role uniqueness constraints are typ-
ically included in linguistic discussions of thematic
roles (Bresnan, 1982; Carlson, 1998). The animacy
heuristic is not always correct, of course. For ex-
ample, in ?The door hit you?, an inanimate object
is the agent of action, and an animate being is the
patient. Nevertheless, it is useful for two reasons.
First, there is a strong cross-linguistic association
between agency and animacy (Aissen, 1999; Dowty,
1991). Second, from the first year of life, children
have strong expectations about the capacities of an-
imate and inanimate entities (Baillargeon et al, in
press). Given the universal tendency for speakers to
talk about animate action on less animate objects,
many sentences will present useful training data to
the SRL: In ordinary sentences such as ?You broke
it,? feedback generated based on animacy will re-
semble gold-standard feedback.
85
2 Learning Model
Our learning task is similar to the full SRL task (Car-
reras and Ma`rquez, 2004), except that we classify
the roles of individual words rather than full phrases.
A full automatic SRL system (e.g. (Punyakanok et
al., 2005a)) typically involves multiple stages to 1)
parse the input, 2) identify arguments, 3) classify
those arguments, and then 4) run inference to make
sure the final labeling for the full sentence does not
violate any linguistic constraints. Our simplified
BabySRL architecture essentially replaces the first
two steps with developmentally plausible heuris-
tics. Rather than identifying arguments via a learned
classifier with access to a full syntactic parse, the
BabySRL treats each noun in the sentence as a can-
didate argument and assigns a semantic role to it. A
simple heuristic collapsed compound or sequential
nouns to their final noun, an approximation of the
head noun of the noun phrase. For example, ?Mr.
Smith? was treated as the single noun ?Smith?. Other
complex noun phrases were not simplified in this
way. Thus, a phrase such as ?the toy on the floor?
would be treated as two separate nouns, ?toy? and
?floor?. This represents the assumption that young
children know ?Mr. Smith? is a single name, but
they do not know all the predicating terms that may
link multiple nouns into a single noun phrase. The
simplified learning task of the BabySRL implements
a key assumption of the structure-mapping account:
that at the start of multiword sentence comprehen-
sion children can tell which words in a sentence are
nouns (Waxman and Booth, 2001), and treat each
noun as a candidate argument.
We further simplify the SRL task such that clas-
sification is between two macro-roles: A0 (agent)
and A1 (non-agent; all non-A0 arguments). We did
so because we reason that this simplified feedback
scheme can be primarily informative for a first stage
of learning in which learners identify how their lan-
guage identifies agents vs. non-agents in sentences.
In addition, this level of role granularity is more con-
sistent across verbs (Palmer et al, 2005).
For argument classification we use a linear clas-
sifier trained with a regularized perceptron update
rule (Grove and Roth, 2001). This learning algo-
rithm provides a simple and general linear classifier
that works well in other language tasks, and allows
us to inspect the weights of key features to determine
their importance for classification.
For the final predictions, the classifier uses
predicate-level inference to ensure coherent argu-
ment assignments. In our task the only active con-
straints are that all nouns require a tag, and that they
have unique labels, which for this restricted case of
A0 vs. not A0 means there will be only one agent.
2.1 Training and Feedback
The key feature of our BabySRL lies in the way
feedback is provided. Ordinarily, during training,
SRL classifiers predict a semantic label for an argu-
ment and receive gold-standard feedback about its
correct semantic role. Such accurate feedback is not
available for the child learner. Children must rely on
their own error-prone interpretation of events to sup-
ply feedback. This internally-generated feedback
signal is presumably derived from multiple infor-
mation sources, including the plausibility of partic-
ular combinations of argument-roles given the cur-
rent situation (Chapman and Kohn, 1978). Here
we model this process by combining background
knowledge with linguistic constraints to generate
a training signal. The ?unsupervised? feedback is
based on: 1) nouns referring to animate entities are
assumed to be agents, while nouns referring to inan-
imate entities are non-agents and 2) each predicate
can have at most one agent.
This internally-generated feedback bears some
similarities to Inference Based Training (Pun-
yakanok et al, 2005b). In both cases the feedback to
local supervised classifiers depends on global con-
straints. With IBT, feedback for mistakes is only
considered after global inference, but for BabySRL
the global inference is applied to the feedback itself.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the training and test-
ing procedure, making clear the distinction between
training and testing inference.
The training data were samples of parental speech
to one child (?Sarah?; (Brown, 1973), available
via Childes (MacWhinney, 2000)). We trained
on parental utterances in samples 1 through 80,
recorded at child age 2;3-3;10 years. All verb-
containing utterances without symbols indicating
long pauses or unintelligible words were automat-
ically parsed with the Charniak parser (Charniak,
1997) and annotated using an existing SRL sys-
86
tem (Punyakanok et al, 2005a). In this initial
pass, sentences with parsing errors that misidenti-
fied argument boundaries were excluded. Role la-
bels were hand-corrected using the PropBank anno-
tation scheme. The child-directed speech training
set consists of about 8300 tagged arguments over
4700 sentences, of which a majority had a single
verb and two labeled nouns1. The annotator agree-
ment on this data set ranged between 95-97% at the
level of arguments. In the current paper these role-
tagged examples provide a comparison point for the
utility of animacy-based feedback during training.
Our BabySRL did not receive these hand-
corrected semantic roles during training. Instead,
for each training example it generated its own feed-
back based in part on an animacy table. To ob-
tain the animacy table we coded the 100 most fre-
quent nouns in our corpus (which constituted less
than 15% of the total number of nouns, but 65%
of noun occurrences). We considered 84 of these
nouns to be unambiguous in animacy: Personal pro-
nouns and nouns referring to people were coded as
animate (30). Nouns referring to objects, body parts,
locations, and times, were coded as inanimate (54).
The remaining 16 nouns were excluded because they
were ambiguous in animacy (e.g., dolls, actions).
We test 3 levels of feedback representing increas-
ing amounts of linguistic knowledge used to gener-
ate internal interpretations of the sentences. Using
the animacy table, Animacy feedback (Feedback 1)
was generated as follows: for each noun in training,
if it was coded as animate it was labeled A0, if it was
coded as inanimate it was labeled A1, otherwise no
feedback was given. Because of the frequency of an-
imate nouns this gives a skewed distribution of 4091
animate agents and 1337 inanimate non-agents.
(Feedback 2) builds on Feedback 1 by adding an-
other linguistic constraint: if a noun was not found
in the animacy-table and there is another noun in the
sentence that is labeled A0, then the unknown noun
is an A1. In the training set this adds non-agent
training examples, yielding 4091 A0 and 2627 A1
examples.
Feedback 1 and Feedback 2 allow two nouns in
a sentence to be labeled with A0. Feedback 3 pre-

cogcomp
vents this; it implements a unique agent constraint
that incorporates bootstrapping to make an ?intelli-
gent guess? about which noun is the correct agent.
This decision is made based on the current predic-
tions of the classifier. Given a sentence with multi-
ple animate nouns, the classifier predicts a label for
each, and the one with the highest score for A0 is
declared the true agent and the rest are classified as
non-agent. Note that we cannot apply role unique-
ness to the A1 (not A0) role, given that this label en-
compasses multiple non-agent roles. This feedback
scheme, allowing at most one agent per sentence, re-
duces the number of A0 examples and increases the
number of A1 examples to 3019 A0 and 3699 A1.
2.2 Feature Sets
The basic feature we propose is the noun pattern fea-
ture (NPattern). We hypothesize that children use
the number and order of nouns to represent argument
structure. The NPattern feature indicates how many
nouns there are in the sentence and which noun the
target is. For example, in the two-noun sentence
?Did you see it??, ?you? has a feature active indicat-
ing that it is the first noun of two. Likewise, for ?it? a
feature is active indicating that it is the second of two
nouns. This feature is easy to compute once nouns
are identified, and does not require fine-grained part-
of-speech distinctions.
We compare the noun pattern feature to a baseline
lexical feature set (Words): the target noun and the
root form of the predicate. The NPattern feature set
includes lexical features as well as features indicat-
ing the number and order of the noun (first of two,
second of three, etc.). With gold-standard role feed-
back, (Connor et al, 2008) found that the NPattern
feature allowed the BabySRL to generalize to new
verbs: it increased the system?s tendency to predict
that the first of two nouns was A0 and the second of
two nouns A1 for verbs not seen in training.
To the extent that in child-directed speech the first
of two nouns tends to be an agent, and agents tend
to be animate, we anticipate that with the NPat-
tern feature the BabySRL will learn the same thing,
even when provided with internally-generated feed-
back based on animacy. In Connor et al (2008) we
showed that, because this NPattern feature set repre-
sents only the number and order of nouns, with this
feature set the BabySRL reproduced the errors chil-

dren make as noted in the Introduction, mistakenly
assigning agent- and non-agent roles to the first and
second nouns in intransitive test sentences contain-
ing two nouns. In the present paper, the linguistic
constraints provide an additional cause for this er-
ror. In addition, as a first step in examining recov-
ery from the predicted error, Connor et al (2008)
added a verb position feature (VPosition) specifying
whether the target noun is before or after the verb.
Given these features, the BabySRL?s classification
of transitive and two-noun intransitive test sentences
diverged, because the gold-standard training sup-
ported the generalization that pre-verbal nouns tend
to be agents, and post-verbal nouns tend to be pa-
tients. In the present paper we include the VPosition
feature for comparison to Connor et al (2008).
2.3 Testing
To evaluate the BabySRL we tested it with both a
held-out sample of child-directed speech, and with
constructed sentences containing novel verbs, like
those used in the experiments with children de-
scribed above. These sentences provide a more
stringent test of generalization than the customary
test on a held-out section of the data. Although the
held-out section of data contains unseen sentences,
it may contain few unseen verbs. In a held out sec-
tion of our data, 650 out of 696 test examples contain
a verb that was encountered in training. Therefore,
the customary test cannot tell us whether the system
generalizes what it learned to novel verbs.
All constructed test sentences contained a novel
verb (?gorp?). We constructed two test sentence tem-
plates: ?A gorps B? and ?A and B gorp?, where A and
B were replaced with nouns that appeared more than
twice in training. For each test sentence template we
built a test set of 100 sentences by randomly sam-
pling nouns in two different ways described next.
Full distribution: The first nouns in the test sen-
tences (A) are chosen from the set of all first nouns
in our corpus, taking their frequency into account
when sampling. The second nouns in the sentences
(B) are chosen from the set of nouns appearing as
second nouns in the sentence of our corpus. This
way of sampling the nouns will maximize the SRL?s
test performance based on the baseline feature set
of lexical information alone (Words). This is so be-
cause in our data many sentences have an animate
first noun and an inanimate second noun. Based on
these words alone the SRL could learn to predict an
A0-A1 role sequence for our test sentences. Nev-
ertheless, we expect that when the BabySRL is also
given the NPattern feature it should be able to per-
form better than this high lexical baseline.
Two animate nouns: In these test sentences the
A and B nouns are chosen from our list of animate
nouns. We chose nouns from this list that were
fairly frequent (ranging from 8 to 240 uses in the
88
corpus), and that occurred roughly equally as the
first and second noun. This mimics the sentences
used in the experiments with children (e.g., ?The
girl is kradding the boy!?). The lexical baseline sys-
tem?s tendency to assign an A0-A1 sequence to these
nouns should be much lower for these test sentences.
We therefore expect the contribution of the NPattern
feature to be more apparent in these test sentences.
The test sentences with novel verbs ask whether
the classifier transfers its learning about argument
role assignment to unseen verbs. Does it assume
the first of two nouns in a simple transitive sentence
(?A gorps B?) is the agent (A0) and the second is
not an agent (A1)? In (Connor et al, 2008) we
showed that a system with the same feature and rep-
resentations also over-generalized this rule to two-
noun intransitives (?A and B gorp?), mimicking chil-
dren?s behavior. In the present paper this error is
over-determined, because the classifier learns only
an agent/non-agent contrast, and the linguistic con-
straints forbid duplicate agents in a sentence. How-
ever, for comparison to the earlier paper we test our
system on the ?A and B gorp? sentences as well.
3 Experimental Results
Our experiments use internally-generated feedback
to train simple, abstract structural features: the
NPattern features that proved useful with gold-
standard training in Connor et al (2008). Sec-
tion 3.1 tests the system on agent-identification in
held-out sentences from the corpus, and demon-
strates that the animacy-based feedback is useful,
yielding SRL performance comparable to that of a
system trained with 1000 sentences of gold-standard
feedback. Section 3.2 presents the critical novel-
verb test data, demonstrating that this system repli-
cates key findings of (Connor et al, 2008) with no
gold standard feedback. Using only noisy internally-
generated feedback, the BabySRL learned that the
first of two nouns is an agent, and generalized this
knowledge to sentences with novel verbs.

Gold Standard Feedback

Table 1: Agent identification results (A0 F1) on held-
out sections of the Sarah Childes corpus. We compare
a classifier trained with various amounts of gold labeled
data (averaging over 10 different samples at each level
of data). For noun pattern features the internally gener-
ated bootstrap feedback provides comparable accuracy to
training with between 100-1000 fully labeled examples.
(+NPattern) when tested on a held-out section of
the Sarah Childes corpus section 84-90, recorded
at child ages 3;11-4;1 years. Agent identification
based on lexical features is quite accurate given an-
imacy feedback alone (Feedback 1). As expected,
because many agents are animate, the animacy tag-
ging heuristic itself is useful. As linguistic con-
straints are added via non-A0 inference (Feedback
2), performance increases for both the lexical base-
line and NPattern feature-set, because the system ex-
periences more non-A0 training examples.
When the unique A0 constraint is added (Feed-
back 3), the lexical baseline performance decreases,
because for the first time animate nouns are being
tagged as non-agents. With this feedback the NPat-
tern feature set yields a larger improvement over lex-
ical baseline, showing that it extracts more general
patterns. We discuss the source of these feedback
differences in the novel-verb test section below.
We compared the usefulness of the internally-
generated feedback to gold-standard feedback by
training a classifier equipped with the same features
on labeled sentences. We reduced the SRL labeling
for the training sentences to the binary agent/non-
agent set, and trained the classifier with 10, 100,
or 1000 labeled examples. Surprisingly, the simple
feedback derived from 84 nouns labeled with ani-
macy information yields performance equivalent to
between 100 and 1000 hand-labeled examples.

were used (?A gorps B?, ?A and B gorp?), along with two different methods of sampling the nouns (Full Distribution,
Animate Nouns) to create test sets with 100 sentences each.
3.2 Comparing Structural Features with
Lexical Features
The previous section shows that the BabySRL
equipped with simple structural features can use
internally generated feedback to learn a simple
agent/non-agent classification, and apply it to un-
seen sentences. In this section we probe what the
SRL has learned by testing generalization to new
verbs in constructed sentences. Table 2 summarizes
these experiments. The results are broken down both
by what sentence structure is used in test (?A gorps
B?, ?A and B gorp?) and how the nouns ?A? and
?B? are sampled (Full Distribution, Animate Nouns).
The results are presented in terms of %A0A1: the
percentage of test sentences that are assigned an
Agent role for ?A? and a non-Agent role for ?B?.
For the transitive ?A gorps B? sentences, A0A1 is
the correct interpretation; A should be the agent. As
predicted, when A and B are sampled from the full
distribution of nouns, simply basing classification on
the Words feature-set aleady strongly predicts this
A0A1 ordering for the majority of cases. This is be-
cause the data (language in general, child directed
speech in particular here) are naturally distributed
such that particular nouns that refer to animates tend
to be agents, and tend to appear as first nouns, and
those that refer to inanimates tend to be non-agents
and second nouns. Thus, a learner representing sen-
tence information in terms of words only succeeds
with full-distribution ?A gorps B? test sentences even
with the simplest animacy feedback (Feedback 1);
the A and B nouns in these test sentences reproduce
the learned distribution. Also as predicted, given this
simple feedback, the additional higher-level features
(NPattern, VPosition) do not improve much upon
the lexical baseline. This is due to the strictly lexical
nature of the animacy feedback: each lexical item
(e.g., ?you? or ?it?) will always either be animate or
inanimate and therefore either A0 or A1. Therefore,
in this case lexical features are the best predictors.
Also as expected, higher-level features (NPat-
tern, and VPosition) improve performance with a
more sophisticated self-generated feedback scheme.
Adding inferred feedback to label unknown nouns
as A1 when the sentence contains a known animate
noun (Feedback 2) decreases the ratio of A0 to non-
A0 arguments. This feedback is less lexically deter-
mined: for nouns whose animacy is unknown, feed-
back will be provided only if there is another ani-
mate noun in the sentence. This leaves room for the
abstract structural features to play a role.
Next we test a form of the unique-A0 constraint.
In (Feedback 3), in addition to the non-A0 inference
added in (Feedback 2), the BabySRL intelligently
selects one noun as A0 in sentences with multiple
animate nouns. With this feedback we see a striking
increase in test performance based on the noun pat-
tern features over the lexical baseline. In principle,
this feedback mechanism might permit the classifier
to start to learn that animate nouns are not always
agents. Early in training, the noun pattern feature
learns that first nouns tend to be animate (and there-
fore interpreted as agents), and it feeds this informa-
90
tion back into subsequent training examples, gen-
erating new feedback that continues to interpret as
agents those animate nouns that appear first in sen-
tences containing two animates.
For the nouns sampled from the full distribution
we see that structural features improve over the lex-
ical baseline despite the high performance of the
lexical baseline. This finding tells us that simple
representations of sentence structure can be use-
ful in learning to interpret sentences even with no
gold-standard training. Provided only with sim-
ple internally-generated feedback based on animacy
knowledge and linguistic constraints, the BabySRL
learned that the first of two nouns tends to be an
agent, and the second of two does not.
The results for the ?A B gorp? test sentences
demonstrate an important way in which predictions
based on different simple structure representations
can diverge. As expected, the NPattern feature
makes the same overgeneralization error seen by
children and the system in (Connor et al, 2008).
However, when the VPosition feature is added, dif-
ferent results are obtained for the ?A gorp B? and
?A and B gorp? sentences. The SRL predicts fewer
A0A1 for ?A and B gorp? (it cannot predict the ex-
pected A0A0 because of the uniqueness constraint
used in test inference).
Next, we replicate our findings by performing the
same experiments with test sentences in which both
?A? and ?B? are animate. Because lexical features
alone cannot determine if ?A? or ?B? should be the
agent, it is a more sensitive test of generalization.
When we look at the lexical baseline for animate
sentences, the agent-first percentage is lower com-
pared to the full distribution results, because the
word features indicate nearly evenly that both nouns
should be agents, so the Words baseline model must
rely on small, chance differences in its experience
with particular words. This percentage is still well
above chance due to the method used to apply in-
ference during testing. Recall that the classifier uses
predicate-level inference at test to ensure that only
one argument is labeled A0. This inference is imple-
mented using a beam search that looks at arguments
in a fixed order and roles from A0 up. Thus in the
case of ties there is a preference for first seen solu-
tions, meaning A0A1 in this case. This bias has a
large effect on the SRL?s baseline performance with
the test sentences containing two animate nouns.
Despite this high baseline, however, because lexical
features alone cannot determine if ?A? or ?B? should
be the agent, we are able to see more clearly the im-
provement gained by including structural features.
Regardless of our testing scheme, we see that as
the feedback incorporates more information, both
added linguistic constraints and the SRL?s own prior
learning, the noun pattern structural feature is better
used to identify agents beyond the lexical baseline.
The largest improvement over this lexical baseline is
obtained by combining knowledge of animacy with
a single-agent constraint and bootstrapping predic-
tions based on prior learning.
4 Conclusion and Future Work
Conventional approaches to supervised learning re-
quire creating large amounts of hand-labeled data.
This is labor-intensive, and limits the relevance of
the work to the study of how children learn lan-
guages. Children do not receive perfect feedback
about sentence interpretation. Here we found that
our simple SRL classifier can, to a surprising de-
gree, attain performance comparable to training with
1000 sentences of labeled data. This suggests that
fully labeled training data can be supplemented by a
combination of simple world knowledge (animates
make good agents) and linguistic constraints (each
verb has only one agent). The combination of these
sources provides an informative training signal that
allows our BabySRL to learn a high-level seman-
tic task and generalize beyond the training data we
provided to it. The SRL learned, based on the dis-
tribution of animates in sentences of child-directed
speech, that the first of two nouns tends to be an
agent. It did so based on representations of sentence
structure as simple as the ordered set of nouns in
the sentence. This demonstrates that it is possible to
learn how to correctly assign semantic roles based
on these very simple cues. This together with exper-
imental work (e.g. (Fisher, 1996) suggests that such
representations might play a role in children?s early
sentence comprehension.

Abstract
A fundamental step in sentence compre-
hension involves assigning semantic roles
to sentence constituents. To accomplish
this, the listener must parse the sentence,
find constituents that are candidate argu-
ments, and assign semantic roles to those
constituents. Each step depends on prior
lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where
do children learning their first languages
begin in solving this problem? In this pa-
per we focus on the parsing and argument-
identification steps that precede Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We
combine a simplified SRL with an un-
supervised HMM part of speech tagger,
and experiment with psycholinguistically-
motivated ways to label clusters resulting
from the HMM so that they can be used
to parse input for the SRL system. The
results show that proposed shallow rep-
resentations of sentence structure are ro-
bust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and
that the contribution of alternative repre-
sentations of sentence structure to suc-
cessful semantic role labeling varies with
the integrity of the parsing and argument-
identification stages.
1 Introduction
In this paper we present experiments with an au-
tomatic system for semantic role labeling (SRL)
that is designed to model aspects of human lan-
guage acquisition. This simplified SRL system is
inspired by the syntactic bootstrapping theory, and
by an account of syntactic bootstrapping known
as ?structure-mapping? (Fisher, 1996; Gillette et
al., 1999; Lidz et al, 2003). Syntactic bootstrap-
ping theory proposes that young children use their
very partial knowledge of syntax to guide sen-
tence comprehension. The structure-mapping ac-
count makes three key assumptions: First, sen-
tence comprehension is grounded by the acquisi-
tion of an initial set of concrete nouns. Nouns are
arguably less dependent on prior linguistic knowl-
edge for their acquisition than are verbs; thus chil-
dren are assumed to be able to identify the refer-
ents of some nouns via cross-situational observa-
tion (Gillette et al, 1999). Second, these nouns,
once identified, yield a skeletal sentence structure.
Children treat each noun as a candidate argument,
and thus interpret the number of nouns in the sen-
tence as a cue to its semantic predicate-argument
structure (Fisher, 1996). Third, children represent
sentences in an abstract format that permits gener-
alization to new verbs (Gertner et al, 2006).
The structure-mapping account of early syn-
tactic bootstrapping makes strong predictions, in-
cluding predictions of tell-tale errors. In the sen-
tence ?Ellen and John laughed?, an intransitive
verb appears with two nouns. If young chil-
dren rely on representations of sentences as sim-
ple as an ordered set of nouns, then they should
have trouble distinguishing such sentences from
transitive sentences. Experimental evidence sug-
gests that they do: 21-month-olds mistakenly in-
terpreted word order in sentences such as ?The girl
and the boy kradded? as conveying agent-patient
roles (Gertner and Fisher, 2006).
Previous computational experiments with a
system for automatic semantic role labeling
(BabySRL: (Connor et al, 2008)) showed that
it is possible to learn to assign basic semantic
roles based on the shallow sentence representa-
tions proposed by the structure-mapping view.
Furthermore, these simple structural features were
robust to drastic reductions in the integrity of
the semantic-role feedback (Connor et al, 2009).
These experiments showed that representations of
sentence structure as simple as ?first of two nouns?
are useful, but the experiments relied on perfect
989
knowledge of arguments and predicates as a start
to classification.
Perfect built-in parsing finesses two problems
facing the human learner. The first problem in-
volves classifying words by part-of-speech. Pro-
posed solutions to this problem in the NLP and
human language acquisition literatures focus on
distributional learning as a key data source (e.g.,
(Mintz, 2003; Johnson, 2007)). Importantly,
infants are good at learning distributional pat-
terns (Gomez and Gerken, 1999; Saffran et al,
1996). Here we use a fairly standard Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) to generate clusters of
words that occur in similar distributional contexts
in a corpus of input sentences.
The second problem facing the learner is
more contentious: Having identified clusters of
distributionally-similar words, how do children
figure out what role these clusters of words should
play in a sentence interpretation system? Some
clusters contain nouns, which are candidate ar-
guments; others contain verbs, which take argu-
ments. How is the child to know which are which?
In order to use the output of the HMM tagger to
process sentences for input to an SRL model, we
must find a way to automatically label the clusters.
Our strategies for automatic argument and pred-
icate identification, spelled out below, reflect core
claims of the structure-mapping theory: (1) The
meanings of some concrete nouns can be learned
without prior linguistic knowledge; these concrete
nouns are assumed based on their meanings to be
possible arguments; (2) verbs are identified, not
primarily by learning their meanings via observa-
tion, but rather by learning about their syntactic
argument-taking behavior in sentences.
By using the HMM part-of-speech tagger in this
way, we can ask how the simple structural fea-
tures that we propose children start with stand up
to reductions in parsing accuracy. In doing so, we
move to a parser derived from a particular theoret-
ical account of how the human learner might clas-
sify words, and link them into a system for sen-
tence comprehension.
2 Model
We model language learning as a Semantic Role
Labeling (SRL) task (Carreras and Ma`rquez,
2004). This allows us to ask whether a learner,
equipped with particular theoretically-motivated
representations of the input, can learn to under-
stand sentences at the level of who did what to
whom. The architecture of our system is similar
to a previous approach to modeling early language
acquisition (Connor et al, 2009), which is itself
based on the standard architecture of a full SRL
system (e.g. (Punyakanok et al, 2008)).
This basic approach follows a multi-stage
pipeline, with each stage feeding in to the next.
The stages are: (1) Parsing the sentence, (2) Iden-
tifying potential predicates and arguments based
on the parse, (3) Classifying role labels for each
potential argument relative to a predicate, (4) Ap-
plying constraints to find the best labeling of ar-
guments for a sentence. In this work we attempt
to limit the knowledge available at each stage to
the automatic output of the previous stage, con-
strained by knowledge that we argue is available
to children in the early stages of language learn-
ing.
In the parsing stage we use an unsupervised
parser based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM),
modeling a simple ?predict the next word? parser.
Next the argument identification stage identifies
HMM states that correspond to possible argu-
ments and predicates. The candidate arguments
and predicates identified in each input sentence are
passed to an SRL classifier that uses simple ab-
stract features based on the number and order of
arguments to learn to assign semantic roles.
As input to our learner we use samples of
natural child directed speech (CDS) from the
CHILDES corpora (MacWhinney, 2000). During
initial unsupervised parsing we experiment with
incorporating knowledge through a combination
of statistical priors favoring a skewed distribution
of words into classes, and an initial hard cluster-
ing of the vocabulary into function and content
words. The argument identifier uses a small set
of frequent nouns to seed argument states, relying
on the assumptions that some concrete nouns can
be learned as a prerequisite to sentence interpreta-
tion, and are interpreted as candidate arguments.
The SRL classifier starts with noisy largely un-
supervised argument identification, and receives
feedback based on annotation in the PropBank
style; in training, each word identified as an argu-
ment receives the true role label of the phrase that
word is part of. This represents the assumption
that learning to interpret sentences is naturally su-
pervised by the fit of the learner?s predicted mean-
ing with the referential context. The provision
990
of perfect ?gold-standard? feedback over-estimates
the real child?s access to this supervision, but al-
lows us to investigate the consequences of noisy
argument identification for SRL performance. We
show that even with imperfect parsing, a learner
can identify useful abstract patterns for sentence
interpretation. Our ultimate goal is to ?close the
loop? of this system, by using learning in the SRL
system to improve the initial unsupervised parse
and argument identification.
The training data were samples of parental
speech to three children (Adam, Eve, and
Sarah; (Brown, 1973)), available via CHILDES.
The SRL training corpus consists of parental utter-
ances in samples Adam 01-20 (child age 2;3 - 3;1),
Eve 01-18 (1;6 - 2;2), and Sarah 01-83 (2;3 - 3;11).
All verb-containing utterances without symbols
indicating disfluencies were automatically parsed
with the Charniak parser (Charniak, 1997), anno-
tated using an existing SRL system (Punyakanok
et al, 2008) and then errors were hand-corrected.
The final annotated sample contains about 16,730
propositions, with 32,205 arguments.
3 Unsupervised Parsing
As a first step of processing, we feed the learner
large amounts of unlabeled text and expect it to
learn some structure over this data that will facil-
itate future processing. The source of this text
is child directed speech collected from various
projects in the CHILDES repository1. We re-
moved sentences with fewer than three words or
markers of disfluency. In the end we used 160
thousand sentences from this set, totaling over 1
million tokens and 10 thousand unique words.
The goal of the parsing stage is to give the
learner a representation permitting it to generalize
over word forms. The exact parse we are after is
a distributional and context-sensitive clustering of
words based on sequential processing. We chose
an HMM based parser for this since, in essence
the HMM yields an unsupervised POS classifier,
but without names for states. An HMM trained
with expectation maximization (EM) is analogous
to a simple process of predicting the next word in a
stream and correcting connections accordingly for
each sentence.
1We used parts of the Bloom (Bloom, 1970; Bloom,
1973), Brent (Brent and Siskind, 2001), Brown (Brown,
1973), Clark (Clark, 1978), Cornell, MacWhin-
ney (MacWhinney, 2000), Post (Demetras et al, 1986)
and Providence (Demuth et al, 2006) collections.
With HMM we can also easily incorporate ad-
ditional knowledge during parameter estimation.
The first (and simplest) parser we used was an
HMM trained using EM with 80 hidden states.
The number of hidden states was made relatively
large to increase the likelihood of clusters corre-
sponding to a single part of speech, while preserv-
ing some degree of generalization.
Johnson (2007) observed that EM tends to cre-
ate word clusters of uniform size, which does
not reflect the way words cluster into parts of
speech in natural languages. The addition of pri-
ors biasing the system toward a skewed alloca-
tion of words to classes can help. The second
parser was an 80 state HMM trained with Varia-
tional Bayes EM (VB) incorporating Dirichlet pri-
ors (Beal, 2003).2
In the third and fourth parsers we experi-
ment with enriching the HMM POS-tagger with
other psycholinguistically plausible knowledge.
Words of different grammatical categories dif-
fer in their phonological as well as in their dis-
tributional properties (e.g., (Kelly, 1992; Mon-
aghan et al, 2005; Shi et al, 1998)); combining
phonological and distributional information im-
proves the clustering of words into grammatical
categories. The phonological difference between
content and function words is particularly strik-
ing (Shi et al, 1998). Even newborns can cate-
gorically distinguish content and function words,
based on the phonological difference between the
two classes (Shi et al, 1999). Human learners may
treat content and function words as distinct classes
from the start.
To implement this division into function and
content words3, we start with a list of function
word POS tags4 and then find words that appear
predominantly with these POS tags, using tagged
WSJ data (Marcus et al, 1993). We allocated a
fixed number of states for these function words,
and left the rest of the states for the rest of the
words. This amounts to initializing the emission
matrix for the HMM with a block structure; words
from one class cannot be emitted by states al-
located to the other class. This trick has been
used before in speech recognition work (Rabiner,
2We tuned the prior using the same set of 8 value pairs
suggested by Gao and Johnson (2008), using a held out set of
POS-tagged CDS to evaluate final performance.
3We also include a small third class for punctuation,
which is discarded.
4TO,IN,EX,POS,WDT,PDT,WRB,MD,CC,DT,RP,UH
991
1989), and requires far fewer resources than the
full tagging dictionary that is often used to intel-
ligently initialize an unsupervised POS classifier
(e.g. (Brill, 1997; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007;
Ravi and Knight, 2009)).
Because the function and content word preclus-
tering preceded parameter estimation, it can be
combined with either EM or VB learning. Al-
though this initial split forces sparsity on the emis-
sion matrix and allows more uniform sized clus-
ters, Dirichlet priors may still help, if word clus-
ters within the function or content word subsets
vary in size and frequency. The third parser was
an 80 state HMM trained with EM estimation,
with 30 states pre-allocated to function words;
the fourth parser was the same except that it was
trained with VB EM.

Figure 1: Unsupervised Part of Speech results, match-
ing states to gold POS labels. All systems use 80 states, and
comparison is to gold labeled CDS text, which makes up a
subset of the HMM training data. Variation of Information is
an information-theoretic measure summing mutual informa-
tion between tags and states, proposed by (Meila?, 2002), and
first used for Unsupervised Part of Speech in (Goldwater and
Griffiths, 2007). Smaller numbers are better, indicating less
information lost in moving from the HMM states to the gold
POS tags. Note that incorporating function word precluster-
ing allows both EM and VB algorithms to achieve the same
performance with an order of magnitude fewer sentences.
We first evaluate these parsers (the first stage
of our SRL system) on unsupervised POS tag-
ging. Figure 1 shows the performance of the four
systems using Variation of Information to mea-
sure match between gold states and unsupervised
parsers as we vary the amount of text they receive.
Each point on the graph represents the average re-
sult over 10 runs of the HMM with different sam-
ples of the unlabeled CDS. Another common mea-
sure for unsupervised POS (when there are more
states than tags) is a many to one greedy mapping
of states to tags. It is known that EM gives a better
many to one score than VB trained HMM (John-
son, 2007), and likewise we see that here: with
all data EM gives 0.75 matching, VB gives 0.74,
while both EM+Funct and VB+Funct reach 0.80.
Adding the function/content word split to the
HMM structure improves both EM and VB esti-
mation in terms of both tag matching accuracy and
information. However, these measures look at the
parser only in isolation. What is more important to
us is how useful the provided word clusters are for
future semantic processing. In the next sections
we use the outputs of our four parsers to identify
arguments and predicates.
4 Argument Identification
The unsupervised parser provides a state label for
each word in each sentence; the goal of the ar-
gument identification stage is to use these states
to label words as potential arguments, predicates
or neither. As described in the introduction, core
premises of the structure-mapping account offer
routes whereby we could label some HMM states
as argument or predicate states.
The structure-mapping account holds that sen-
tence comprehension is grounded in the learning
of an initial set of nouns. Children are assumed
to identify the referents of some concrete nouns
via cross-situational learning (Gillette et al, 1999;
Smith and Yu, 2008). Children then assume, by
virtue of the meanings of these nouns, that they are
candidate arguments. This is a simple form of se-
mantic bootstrapping, requiring the use of built-in
links between semantics and syntax to identify the
grammatical type of known words (Pinker, 1984).
We use a small set of known nouns to transform
unlabeled word clusters into candidate arguments
for the SRL: HMM states that are dominated by
known names for animate or inanimate objects are
assumed to be argument states.
Given text parsed by the HMM parser and a
list of known nouns, the argument identifier pro-
ceeds in multiple steps as illustrated in figure 2.
The first stage identifies as argument states those
states that appear at least half the time in the train-
ing data with known nouns. This use of a seed
list and distributional clustering is similar to Proto-
type Driven Learning (Haghighi and Klein, 2006),
except we are only providing information on one
specific class.

Figure 2: Argument identification algorithm. This is a two
stage process: argument state identification based on statis-
tics collected over entire text and per sentence predicate iden-
tification.
As a list of known nouns we collected all those
nouns that appear three times or more in the child
directed speech training data and judged to be ei-
ther animate or inanimate nouns. The full set of
365 nouns covers over 93% of noun occurences
in our data. In upcoming sections we experiment
with varying the number of seed nouns used from
this set, selecting the most frequent set of nouns.
Reflecting the spoken nature of the child directed
speech, the most frequent nouns are pronouns,
but beyond the top 10 we see nouns naming peo-
ple (?daddy?, ?ursula?) and object nouns (?chair?,
?lunch?).
What about verbs? A typical SRL model iden-
tifies candidate arguments and tries to assign roles
to them relative to each verb in the sentence. In
principle one might suppose that children learn
the meanings of verbs via cross-situational ob-
servation just as they learn the meanings of con-
crete nouns. But identifying the meanings of
verbs is much more troublesome. Verbs? mean-
ings are abstract, therefore harder to identify based
on scene information alone (Gillette et al, 1999).
As a result, early vocabularies are dominated by
nouns (Gentner, 2006). On the structure-mapping
account, learners identify verbs, and begin to de-
termine their meanings, based on sentence struc-
ture cues. Verbs take noun arguments; thus, learn-
ers could learn which words are verbs by detect-
ing each verb?s syntactic argument-taking behav-
ior. Experimental evidence provides some support
for this procedure: 2-year-olds keep track of the
syntactic structures in which a new verb appears,
even without a concurrent scene that provides cues
to the verb?s semantic content (Yuan and Fisher,
2009).
We implement this behavior by identifying as
predicate states the HMM states that appear com-
monly with a particular number of previously
identified arguments. First, we collect statistics
over the entire HMM training corpus regarding
how many arguments are identified per sentence,
and which states that are not identified as argu-
ment states appear with each number of argu-
ments. Next, for each parsed sentence that serves
as SRL input, the algorithm chooses as the most
likely predicate the word whose state is most likely
to appear with the number of arguments found in
the current input sentence. Note that this algo-
rithm assumes exactly one predicate per sentence.
Implicitly, the argument count likelihood divides
predicate states up into transitive and intransitive
predicates based on appearances in the simple sen-
tences of CDS.
4.1 Argument Identification Evaluation
Figure 3 shows argument and predicate identifi-
cation accuracy for each of the four parsers when
provided with different numbers of known nouns.
The known word list is very skewed with its most
frequent members dominating the total noun oc-
currences in the data. The ten most frequent
words5 account for 60% of the total noun occur-
rences. We achieve the different occurrence cov-
erage numbers of figure 3 by using the most fre-
quent N words from the list that give the specific
coverage6. Pronouns refer to people or objects,
but are abstract in that they can refer to any person
or object. The inclusion of pronouns in our list of
5you, it, I, what, he, me, ya, she, we, her
6N of 5, 10, 30, 83, 227 cover 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,
90% of all noun occurrences

Figure 3: Effect of number of concrete nouns for seeding

Argument identification accuracy is computed against true ar-
gument boundaries from hand labeled data. The upper set of
results show primary argument (A0-4) identification F1, and
bottom lines show predicate identification F1.
known nouns represents the assumption that tod-
dlers have already identified pronouns as referen-
tial terms. Even 19-month-olds assign appropri-
ately different interpretations to novel verbs pre-
sented in simple transitive versus intransitive sen-
tences with pronoun arguments (?He?s kradding
him!? vs. ?He?s kradding!?; (Yuan et al, 2007)).
In ongoing work we experiment with other meth-
ods of identifying seed nouns.
Two groups of curves appear in figure 3: the
upper group shows the primary argument iden-
tification accuracy and the bottom group shows
the predicate identification accuracy. We evaluate
compared to gold tagged data with true argument
and predicate boundaries. The primary argument
(A0-4) identification accuracy is the F1 value, with
precision calculated as the proportion of identified
arguments that appear as part of a true argument,
and recall as the proportion of true arguments that
have some state identified as an argument. F1 is
calculated similarly for predicate identification, as
one state per sentence is identified as the predicate.
As shown in figure 3, argument identification F1
is higher than predicate identification (which is to
be expected, given that predicate identification de-
pends on accurate arguments), and as we add more
seed nouns the argument identification improves.
Surprisingly, despite the clear differences in un-
supervised POS performance seen in figure 1, the
different parsers do not yield very different argu-
ment and predicate identification. As we will see
in the next section, however, when the arguments
identified in this step are used to train SRL clas-
sifier, distinctions between parsers reappear, sug-
gesting that argument identification F1 masks sys-
tematic patterns in the errors.
5 Testing SRL Performance
Finally, we used the results of the previous pars-
ing and argument-identification stages in training
a simplified SRL classifier (BabySRL), equipped
with sets of features derived from the structure-
mapping account. For argument classification we
used a linear classifier trained with a regularized
perceptron update rule (Grove and Roth, 2001).
In the results reported below the BabySRL did
not use sentence-level inference for the final clas-
sification, every identified argument is classified
independently; thus multiple nouns can have the
same role. In what follows, we compare the per-
formance of the BabySRL across the four parsers.
We evaluated SRL performance by testing the
BabySRL with constructed sentences like those
used for the experiments with children described
in the Introduction. All test sentences contained a
novel verb, to test the model?s ability to general-
ize.
We examine the performance of four versions
of the BabySRL, varying in the features used to
represent sentences. All four versions include
lexical features consisting of the target argument
and predicate (as identified in the previous steps).
The baseline model has only these lexical features
(Lexical). Following Connor et al (2008; 2009),
the key feature type we propose is noun pattern
features (NounPat). Noun pattern features indi-
cate how many nouns there are in the sentence and
which noun the target is. For example, in ?You
dropped it!?, ?you? has a feature active indicating
that it is the first of two nouns, while ?it? has a fea-
ture active indicating that it is the second of two
nouns. We compared the behavior of noun pat-
tern features to another simple representation of
word order, position relative to the verb (VerbPos).
In the same example sentence, ?you? has a feature
active indicating that it is pre-verbal; for ?it? a fea-
ture is active indicating that it is post-verbal. A
fourth version of the BabySRL (Combined) used
both NounPat and VerbPos features.
We structured our tests of the BabySRL to test
the predictions of the structure-mapping account.
(1) NounPat features will improve the SRL?s abil-
ity to interpret simple transitive test sentences
containing two nouns and a novel verb, relative
994
to a lexical baseline. Like 21-month-old chil-
dren (Gertner et al, 2006), the SRL should inter-
pret the first noun as an agent and the second as
a patient. (2) Because NounPat features represent
word order solely in terms of a sequence of nouns,
an SRL equipped with these features will make the
errors predicted by the structure-mapping account
and documented in children (Gertner and Fisher,
2006). (3) NounPat features permit the SRL to
assign different roles to the subjects of transitive
and intransitive sentences that differ in their num-
ber of nouns. This effect follows from the nature
of the NounPat features: These features partition
the training data based on the number of nouns,
and therefore learn separately the likely roles of
the ?1st of 1 noun? and the ?1st of 2 nouns?.
These patterns contrast with the behavior of the
VerbPos features: When the BabySRL was trained
with perfect parsing, VerbPos promoted agent-
patient interpretations of transitive test sentences,
and did so even more successfully than Noun-
Pat features did, reflecting the usefulness of po-
sition relative to the verb in understanding English
sentences. In addition, VerbPos features elimi-
nated the errors with two-noun intransitive sen-
tences. Given test sentences such as ?You and
Mommy krad?, VerbPos features represented both
nouns as pre-verbal, and therefore identified both
as likely agents. However, VerbPos features did
not help the SRL assign different roles to the
subjects of simple transitive and intransitive sen-
tences: ?Mommy? in ?Mommy krads you? and
?Mommy krads? are both represented simply as
pre-verbal.
To test the system?s predictions on transitive and
intransitive two noun sentences, we constructed
two test sentence templates: ?A krads B? and ?A
and B krad?, where A and B were replaced with
familiar animate nouns. The animate nouns were
selected from all three children?s data in the train-
ing set and paired together in the templates such
that all pairs are represented.
Figure 4 shows SRL performance on test sen-
tences containing a novel verb and two animate
nouns. Each plot shows the proportion of test sen-
tences that were assigned an agent-patient (A0-
A1) role sequence; this sequence is correct for
transitive sentences but is an error for two-noun
intransitive sentences. Each group of bars shows
the performance of the BabySRL trained using one
of the four parsers, equipped with each of our four
feature sets. The top and bottom panels in Figure 4
differ in the number of nouns provided to seed the
argument identification stage. The top row shows
performance with 10 seed nouns (the 10 most fre-
quent nouns, mostly animate pronouns), and the
bottom row shows performance with 365 concrete
(animate or inanimate) nouns treated as known.
Relative to the lexical baseline, NounPat features
fared well: they promoted the assignment of A0-
A1 interpretations to transitive sentences, across
all parser versions and both sets of known nouns.
Both VB estimation and the content-function word
split increased the ability of NounPat features to
learn that the first of two nouns was an agent, and
the second a patient. The NounPat features also
promote the predicted error with two-noun intran-
sitive sentences (Figures 4(b), 4(d)). Despite the
relatively low accuracy of predicate identification
noted in section 4.1, the VerbPos features did suc-
ceed in promoting an A0A1 interpretation for tran-
sitive sentences containing novel verbs relative to
the lexical baseline. In every case the performance
of the Combined model that includes both Noun-
Pat and VerbPos features exceeds the performance
of either NounPat or VerbPos alone, suggesting
both contribute to correct predictions for transitive
sentences. However, the performance of VerbPos
features did not improve with parsing accuracy as
did the performance of the NounPat features. Most
strikingly, the VerbPos features did not eliminate
the predicted error with two-noun intransitive sen-
tences, as shown in panels 4(b) and 4(d). The
Combined model predicted an A0A1 sequence for
these sentences, showing no reduction in this error
due to the participation of VerbPos features.
Table 1 shows SRL performance on the same
transitive test sentences (?A krads B?), compared
to simple one-noun intransitive sentences (?A
krads?). To permit a direct comparison, the table
reports the proportion of transitive test sentences
for which the first noun was assigned an agent
(A0) interpretation, and the proportion of intran-
sitive test sentences with the agent (A0) role as-
signed to the single noun in the sentence. Here we
report only the results from the best-performing
parser (trained with VB EM, and content/function
word pre-clustering), compared to the same clas-
sifiers trained with gold standard argument iden-
tification. When trained on arguments identified
via the unsupervised POS tagger, noun pattern
features promoted agent interpretations of tran-

Comparison is between agent first prediction of two noun transitive sentences vs. one noun intransitive sentences. The unsu-
pervised arguments lead the classifier to rely more on noun pattern features; when the true arguments and predicate are known
the verb position feature leads the classifier to strongly indicate agent first in both settings.

Figure 4: SRL classification performance on transitive and intransitive test sentences containing two nouns and a novel
verb. Performance with gold-standard argument identification is included for comparison. Across parses, noun pattern features
promote agent-patient (A0A1) interpretations of both transitive (?You krad Mommy?) and two-noun intransitive sentences
(?You and Mommy krad?); the latter is an error found in young children. Unsupervised parsing is less accurate in identifying
the verb, so verb position features fail to eliminate errors with two-noun intransitive sentences.
sitive subjects, but not for intransitive subjects.
This differentiation between transitive and intran-
sitive sentences was clearer when more known
nouns were provided. Verb position features, in
contrast, promote agent interpretations of subjects
weakly with unsupervised argument identification,
but equally for transitive and intransitive.
Noun pattern features were robust to increases
in parsing noise. The behavior of verb position
features suggests that variations in the identifiabil-
ity of different parts of speech can affect the use-
fulness of alternative representations of sentence
structure. Representations that reflect the posi-
tion of the verb may be powerful guides for un-
derstanding simple English sentences, but repre-
sentations reflecting only the number and order of
nouns can dominate early in acquisition, depend-
ing on the integrity of parsing decisions.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
The key innovation in the present work is the
combination of unsupervised part-of-speech tag-
ging and argument identification to permit learn-
ing in a simplified SRL system. Children do not
996
have the luxury of treating part-of-speech tagging
and semantic role labeling as separable tasks. In-
stead, they must learn to understand sentences
starting from scratch, learning the meanings of
some words, and using those words and their pat-
terns of arrangement into sentences to bootstrap
their way into more mature knowledge.
We have created a first step toward modeling
this incremental process. We combined unsuper-
vised parsing with minimal supervision to begin to
identify arguments and predicates. An SRL clas-
sifier used simple representations built from these
identified arguments to extract useful abstract pat-
terns for classifying semantic roles. Our results
suggest that multiple simple representations of
sentence structure could co-exist in the child?s sys-
tem for sentence comprehension; representations
that will ultimately turn out to be powerful guides
to role identification may be less powerful early in
acquisition because of the noise introduced by the
unsupervised parsing.
The next step is to ?close the loop?, using higher
level semantic feedback to improve the earlier ar-
gument identification and parsing stages. Per-
haps with the help of semantic feedback the sys-
tem can automatically improve predicate identifi-
cation, which in turn allows it to correct the ob-
served intransitive sentence error. This approach
will move us closer to the goal of using initial sim-
ple structural patterns and natural observation of
the world (semantic feedback) to bootstrap more
and more sophisticated representations of linguis-
tic structure.

Abstract
A fundamental task in sentence compre-
hension is to assign semantic roles to sen-
tence constituents. The structure-mapping
account proposes that children start with
a shallow structural analysis of sentences:
children treat the number of nouns in the
sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate-
argument structure, and represent language
experience in an abstract format that per-
mits rapid generalization to new verbs. In
this paper, we tested the consequences of
these representational assumptions via ex-
periments with a system for automatic se-
mantic role labeling (SRL), trained on a
sample of child-directed speech. When
the SRL was presented with representa-
tions of sentence structure consisting sim-
ply of an ordered set of nouns, it mim-
icked experimental findings with toddlers,
including a striking error found in children.
Adding features representing the position
of the verb increased accuracy and elim-
inated the error. We show the SRL sys-
tem can use incremental knowledge gain
to switch from error-prone noun order fea-
tures to a more accurate representation,
demonstrating a possible mechanism for
this process in child development.

children start with a shallow structural analysis of
sentences: children treat the number of nouns in
the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate-
argument structure (Fisher, 1996), and represent
language experience in an abstract format that per-
mits rapid generalization to new verbs (Gertner et
al., 2006).
The structure-mapping account makes strong
predictions. First, as soon as children can identify
some nouns, they should interpret transitive and in-
transitive sentences differently, simply by assign-
ing a distinct semantic role to each noun in the sen-
tence. Second, language-specific syntactic learn-
ing should transfer rapidly to new verbs. Third,
some striking errors of interpretation can occur.
In ?Fred and Ginger danced?, an intransitive verb
is presented with two nouns. If children interpret
any two-noun sentence as if it were transitive, they
should be fooled into interpreting the order of two
nouns in such conjoined-subject intransitive sen-
tences as conveying agent-patient role information.
Experiments with young children support these
predictions. First, 21-month-olds use the number
of nouns to understand sentences containing new
verbs (Yuan et al, 2007). Second, 21-month-olds
generalize what they have learned about English
transitive word-order to sentences containing new
verbs: Children who heard ?The girl is gorping the
boy? interpreted the girl as an agent and the boy as
a patient (Gertner et al, 2006). Third, 21-month-
olds make the predicted error, treating intransitive
sentences containing two nouns as if they were
transitive: they interpret the first noun in ?The girl
and the boy are gorping? as an agent and the sec-
ond as a patient (Gertner and Fisher, 2006). This
error is short-lived. By 25 months, children add
new features to their representations of sentences,
and interpret conjoined-subject intransitives differ-
81
ently from transitives (Naigles, 1990).
These experimental results shed light on what
syntactic information children might have avail-
able for early sentence comprehension, but do not
rule out the possibility that children?s early per-
formance is based on a more complex underlying
system. In this paper, we tested the consequences
of our representational assumptions by perform-
ing experiments with a system for automatic se-
mantic role labeling (SRL), whose knowledge of
sentence structure is under our control. Com-
putational models of semantic role labeling learn
to identify, for each verb in a sentence, all con-
stituents that fill a semantic role, and to determine
their roles. We adopt the architecture proposed
by Roth and colleagues (Punyakanok et al, 2005),
limiting the classifier?s features to a set of lexical
features and shallow structural features suggested
by the structure-mapping account. Learning abil-
ity is measured by the level of SRL accuracy and,
more importantly, the types of errors made by the
system on sentences containing novel verbs. Test-
ing these predictions on the automatic SRL pro-
vides us with a demonstration that it is possible to
learn how to correctly assign semantic roles based
only on these very simple cues.
From an NLP perspective this feature study pro-
vides evidence for the efficacy of alternative, sim-
pler syntactic representations in gaining an initial
foothold on sentence interpretation. It is clear that
human learners do not begin interpreting sentences
in possession of full part-of-speech tagging, or full
parse trees. By building a model that uses shal-
low representations of sentences and mimics fea-
tures of language development in children, we can
explore the nature of initial representations of syn-
tactic structure and build more complex features
from there, further mimicking child development.
2 Learning Model
We trained a simplified SRL classifier (Baby SRL)
with sets of features derived from the structure-
mapping account. Our test used novel verbs to
mimic sentences presented in experiments with
children. Our learning task is similar to the full
SRL task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004), except
that we classify the roles of individual words rather
than full phrases. A full automatic SRL system
(e.g. (Punyakanok et al, 2005)) typically involves
multiple stages to 1) parse the input, 2) identify ar-
guments, 3) classify those arguments, and then 4)
run inference to make sure the final labeling for the
full sentence does not violate any linguistic con-
straints. Our simplified SRL architecture (Baby
SRL) essentially replaces the first two steps with
heuristics. Rather than identifying arguments via
a learned classifier with access to a full syntac-
tic parse, the Baby SRL treats each noun in the
sentence as a candidate argument and assigns a
semantic role to it. A simple heuristic collapsed
compound or sequential nouns to their final noun:
an approximation of the head noun of the noun
phrase. For example, ?Mr. Smith? was treated
as the single noun ?Smith?. Other complex noun
phrases were not simplified in this way. Thus,
a phrase such as ?the toy on the floor? would be
treated as two separate nouns, ?toy? and ?floor?.
This represents the assumption that young children
know ?Mr. Smith? is a single name, but they do not
know all the predicating terms that may link mul-
tiple nouns into a single noun phrase. The simpli-
fied learning task of the Baby SRL implements a
key assumption of the structure-mapping account:
that at the start of multiword sentence comprehen-
sion children can tell which words in a sentence are
nouns (Waxman and Booth, 2001), and treat each
noun as a candidate argument.
Feedback is provided based on annotation in
Propbank style: in training, each noun receives the
role label of the phrase that noun is part of. Feed-
back is given at the level of the macro-role (agent,
patient, etc., labeled A0-A4 for core arguments,
and AM-* adjuncts). We also introduced a NO la-
bel for nouns that are not part of any argument.
For argument classification we use a linear clas-
sifier trained with a regularized perceptron update
rule (Grove and Roth, 2001). This learning algo-
rithm provides a simple and general linear clas-
sifier that has been demonstrated to work well in
other text classification tasks, and allows us to in-
spect the weights of key features to determine their
importance for classification. The Baby SRL does
not use inference for the final classification. In-
stead it classifies every argument independently;
thus multiple nouns can have the same role.
2.1 Training
The training data were samples of parental speech
to one child (?Eve?; (Brown, 1973), available
via Childes (MacWhinney, 2000)). We trained
on parental utterances in samples 9 through 20,
recorded at child age 21-27 months. All verb-
82
containing utterances without symbols indicating
long pauses or unintelligible words were automat-
ically parsed with the Charniak parser (Charniak,
1997) and annotated using an existing SRL sys-
tem (Punyakanok et al, 2005). In this initial pass,
sentences with parsing errors that misidentified ar-
gument boundaries were excluded. Final role la-
bels were hand-corrected using the Propbank an-
notation scheme (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).
The child-directed speech (CDS) training set con-
sisted of about 2200 sentences, of which a majority
had a single verb and two nouns to be labeled
1
. We
used the annotated CDS training data to train our
Baby SRL, converting labeled phrases to labeled
nouns in the manner described above.
3 Experimental Results
To evaluate the Baby SRL we tested it with sen-
tences like those used for the experiments with
children described above. All test sentences con-
tained a novel verb (?gorp?). We constructed two
test sentence templates: ?A gorps B? and ?A and B
gorp?, where A and B were replaced with nouns
that appeared more than twice in training. We
filled the A and B slots by sampling nouns that
occurred roughly equally as the first and second
of two nouns in the training data. This procedure
was adopted to avoid ?building in? the predicted er-
ror by choosing A and B nouns biased toward an
agent-patient interpretation. For each test sentence
template we built a test set of 100 sentences by ran-
domly sampling nouns in this fashion.
The test sentences with novel verbs ask whether
the classifier transfers its learning about argument
role assignment to unseen verbs. Does it as-
sume the first of two nouns in a simple transi-
tive sentence (?A gorps B?) is the agent (A0) and
the second is the patient (A1)? Does it over-
generalize this rule to two-noun intransitives (?A
and B gorp?), mimicking children?s behavior? We
used two measures of success, one to assess clas-
sification accuracy, and the other to assess the
predicted error. We used a per argument F1 for
classification accuracy, with F1 based on correct
identification of individual nouns rather than full
phrases. Here precision is defined as the propor-
tion of nouns that were given the correct label
based on the argument they belong to, and recall
is the proportion of complete arguments for which
1

?
cogcomp/data.php
some noun in that argument was correctly labeled.
The desired labeling for ?A gorps B? is A0 for the
first argument and A1 for the second; for ?A and
B gorp? both arguments should be A0. To mea-
sure predicted errors we also report the proportion
of test sentences classified with A0 first and A1
second (%A0A1). This labeling is a correct gener-
alization for the novel ?A gorps B? sentences, but
is an overgeneralization for ?A and B gorp.?
3.1 Noun Pattern
The basic feature we propose is the noun pattern
feature. We hypothesize that children use the num-
ber and order of nouns to represent argument struc-
ture. To encode this we created a feature (NPat-
tern) that indicates how many nouns there are in
the sentence and which noun the target is. For ex-
ample, in our two-noun test sentences noun A has
the feature ? N? active indicating that it is the first
noun of two. Likewise for B the feature ?N ? is ac-
tive, indicating that it is the second of two nouns.
This feature is easy to compute once nouns are
identified, and does not require fine-grained dis-
tinctions between types of nouns or any other part
of speech. Table 1 shows the initial feature pro-
gression that involves this feature. The baseline
system (feature set 1) uses lexical features only:
the target noun and the root form of the predicate.
We first tested the hypothesis that children use
the NPattern features to distinguish different noun
arguments, but only for specific verbs. The NPat-
tern&V features are conjunctions of the target verb
and the noun pattern, and these are added to the
word features to form feature set 2. Now every
example has three features active: target noun, tar-
get predicate, and a NPattern&V feature indicating
?the target is the first of two nouns and the verb
is X.? This feature does not improve results on the
novel ?A gorps B? test set, or generate the predicted
error with the ?A and B gorp? test set, because the
verb-specific NPattern&V features provide no way
to generalize to unseen verbs.
We next tested the NPattern feature alone, with-
out making it verb-specific (feature set 3). The
noun pattern feature was added to the word fea-
tures and again each example had three features ac-
tive: target noun, target predicate, and the target?s
noun-pattern feature (first of two, second of three,
etc.). The abstract NPattern feature allows the
Baby SRL to generalize to new verbs: it increases
the system?s tendency to predict that the first of two

Table 1: Experiments showing the efficacy of Noun Pattern features for determining agent/patient roles in
simple two-noun sentences. The novel verb test sets assess whether the Baby SRL generalizes transitive
argument prediction to unseen verbs in the case of ?A gorps B? (increasing %A0A1 and thus F1), and
overgeneralizes in the case of ?A and B gorp? (increasing %A0A1, which is an error). By varying the
sampling method for creating the test sentences we can start with a biased or unbiased lexical baseline,
demonstrating that the noun pattern features still improve over knowledge that can be contained in
typical noun usage. The simple noun pattern features are still effective at learning this pattern when
trained with more complex Wall Street Journal training data.
nouns is A0 and the second of two nouns is A1 for
verbs not seen in training. Feature set 4 includes
both the abstract, non-verb-specific NPattern fea-
ture and the verb-specific version. This feature set
preserves the ability to generalize to unseen verbs;
thus the availability of the verb-specific NPattern
features during training did not prevent the abstract
NPattern features from gathering useful informa-
tion.
3.2 Lexical Cues for Role-Labeling
Thus far, the target nouns? lexical features pro-
vided little help in role labeling, allowing us to
clearly see the contribution of the proposed sim-
ple structural features. Would our structural fea-
tures produce any improvement above a more re-
alistic lexical baseline? We created a new set of
test sentences, sampling the A nouns based on the
distribution of nouns seen as the first of two nouns
in training, and the B nouns based on the distri-
bution of nouns seen as the second of two nouns.
Given this revised sampling of nouns, the words-
only baseline is strongly biased toward A0A1 (bi-
ased results for feature set 1 in table 1). This high
baseline reflects a general property of conversa-
tion: Lexical choices provide considerable infor-
mation about semantic roles. For example, the 6
most common nouns in the Eve corpus are pro-
nouns that are strongly biased in their positions
and in their semantic roles (e.g., ?you?, ?it?). De-
spite this high baseline, however, we see the same
pattern in the unbiased and biased experiments in
table 1. The addition of the NPattern features (fea-
ture set 3) substantially improves performance on
?A gorps B? test sentences, and promotes over-
generalization errors on ?A and B gorp? sentences.
3.3 More Complex Training Data
For comparison purposes we also trained the Baby
SRL on a subset of the Propbank training data
of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text (Kingsbury and
Palmer, 2002). To approximate the simpler sen-
tences of child-directed speech we selected only
those sentences with 8 or fewer words. This
provided a training set of about 2500 sentences,
most with a single verb and two nouns to be la-
beled. The CDS and WSJ data pose similar prob-
lems for learning abstract and verb-specific knowl-
edge. However, newspaper text differs from ca-
sual speech to children in many ways, including
vocabulary and sentence complexity. One could
argue that the WSJ corpus presents a worst-case
scenario for learning based on shallow representa-
tions of sentence structure: Full passive sentences
are more common in written corpora such as the
WSJ than in samples of conversational speech, for
example (Roland et al, 2007). As a result of such
differences, two-noun sequences are less likely to
display an A0-A1 sequence in the WSJ (0.42 A0-
A1 in 2-noun sentences) than in the CDS training
data (0.67 A0-A1). The WSJ data provides a more
demanding test of the Baby SRL.
We trained the Baby SRL on the WSJ data, and
tested it using the biased lexical choices as de-
scribed above, sampling A and B nouns for novel-
verb test sentences based on the distribution of
nouns seen as the first of two nouns in training, and
as the second of two nouns, respectively. The WSJ
training produced performance strikingly similar
to the performance resulting from CDS training
(last 4 columns of Table 1). Even in this more
complex training set, the addition of the NPattern
84
features (feature set 3) improves performance on
?A gorps B? test sentences, and promotes over-
generalization errors on ?A and B gorp? sentences.

Table 2: Testing NPattern features on full SRL task
of heldout section 8 of Eve when trained on sec-
tions 9 through 20. Each result column reflects a

Learning to interpret sentences depends on bal-
ancing abstract and verb-specific structural knowl-
edge. Natural linguistic corpora, including our
CDS training data, have few verbs of very high fre-
quency and a long tail of rare verbs. Frequent verbs
occur with differing argument patterns. For exam-
ple, ?have? and ?put? are frequent in the CDS data.
?Have? nearly always occurs in simple transitive
sentences that display the canonical word order of
English (e.g., ?I have cookies?). ?Put?, in contrast,
tends to appear in non-canonical sentences that do
not display an agent-patient ordering, including
imperatives (?Put it on the floor?). To probe the
Baby SRL?s ability to learn the argument-structure
preferences of familiar verbs, we tested it on a
held-out sample of CDS from the same source
(Eve sample 8, approximately 234 labeled sen-
tences). Table 2 shows the same feature progres-
sion shown previously, with the full SRL test set.
The words-only baseline (feature set 1 in Table 2)
yields fairly accurate performance, showing that
considerable success in role assignment in these
simple sentences can be achieved based on the
argument-role biases of the target nouns and the
familiar verbs. Despite this high baseline, how-
ever, we still see the benefit of simple structural
features. Adding verb-specific (feature set 2) or
abstract NPattern features (feature set 3) improves
classification performance, and the combination of
both verb-specific and abstract NPattern features
(feature set 4) yields higher performance than ei-
ther alone. The combination of abstract NPattern
features with the verb-specific versions allows the
Baby SRL both to generalize to unseen verbs, as
seen in earlier sections, and to learn the idiosyn-
crasies of known verbs.
3.5 Verb Position
The noun pattern feature results show that the
Baby SRL can learn helpful rules for argument-
role assignment using only information about the
number and order of nouns. It also makes the error
predicted by the structure-mapping account, and
documented in children, because it has no way to
represent the difference between the ?A gorps B?
and ?A and B gorp? test sentences. At some point
the learner must develop more sophisticated syn-
tactic representations that could differentiate these
two. These could include many aspects of the sen-
tence, including noun-phrase and verb-phrase mor-
phological features, and word-order features. As a
first step in examining recovery from the predicted
error, we focused on word-order features. We did
this by adding a verb position feature (VPosition)
that specifies whether the target noun is before or
after the verb. Now simple transitive sentences in
training should support the generalization that pre-
verbal nouns tend to be agents, and post-verbal
nouns tend to be patients. In testing, the Baby
SRL?s classification of the ?A gorps B? and ?A and
B gorp? sentences should diverge.
When we add verb position information (fea-
ture set 5 in table 1 and 2), performance improves
still further for transitive sentences, both with bi-
ased and unbiased test sentences. Also, for the first
time, the A0A1 pattern is predicted less often for
?A and B gorp? sentences. This error diminished
because the classifier was able to use the verb po-
sition features to distinguish these from ?A gorps
B? sentences.

Table 3: Verb Position vs. Noun Pattern features
alone. Verb position features yield better overall
performance, but do not replicate the error on ?A
and B gorp? sentences seen with children.
Verb position alone provides another simple ab-
stract representation of sentence structure, so it
might be proposed as an equally natural initial
representation for human learners, rather than the
noun pattern features we proposed. The VPo-
sition features should also support learning and
generalization of word-order rules for interpret-
ing transitive sentences, thus reproducing some of
85
the data from children that we reviewed above.
In table 3 we compared the words-only baseline
(set 1), words and NPattern features (set 3), and a
new feature set, words and VPosition (set 6). In
terms of correct performance on novel transitive
verbs (?A gorps B?), the VPosition features out-
perform the NPattern features. This may be partly
because the same VPosition features are used in
all sentences during training, while the NPattern
features partition sentences by number of nouns,
but is also due to the fact that the verb position
features provide a more sophisticated representa-
tion of English sentence structure. Verb position
features can distinguish transitive sentences from
imperatives containing multiple post-verbal nouns,
for example. Although verb position is ultimately
a more powerful representation of word order for
English sentences, it does not accurately reproduce
a 21-month-old?s performance on all aspects of
this task. In particular, the VPosition feature does
not support the overgeneralization of the A0A1
pattern to the ?A and B gorp? test sentences. This
suggests that children?s very early sentence com-
prehension is dominated by less sophisticated rep-
resentations of word order, akin to the NPattern
features we proposed.
3.6 Informativeness vs. Availability
In the preceding sections, we modeled increases
in syntactic knowledge by building in more so-
phisticated features. The Baby SRL escaped the
predicted error on two-noun intransitive sentences
when given access to features reflecting the posi-
tion of the target noun relative to the verb. This
imposed sequence of features is useful as a starting
point, but a more satisfying approach would be to
use the Baby SRL to explore possible reasons why
NPattern features might dominate early in acquisi-
tion, even though VPosition features are ultimately
more useful for English.
In theory, a feature might be unavailable early in
acquisition because of its computational complex-
ity. For example, lexical features are presumably
less complex than relative position features such as
NPattern and VPosition. In practice, features can
also be unavailable at first because of an informa-
tional lack. Here we suggest that NPattern features
might dominate VPosition features early in acqui-
sition because the early lexicon is dominated by
nouns, and it is easier to compute position relative
to a known word than to an unknown word. Many
studies have shown that children?s early vocabu-
lary is dominated by names for objects and peo-
ple (Gentner and Boroditsky, 2001).

Figure 1: Testing the consequences of the assump-
tion that Verb Position features are only active for
familiar verbs. The figure plots the bias of the fea-
tures ? N? and ? V? to predict A0 over A1, as the
difference between the weights of these connec-
tions in the learned network. Verb position fea-
tures win out over noun pattern features as the
verb vocabulary grows. Varying the verb familiar-
ity threshold ((a) vs. (b)) and the presence versus
absence of verb-specific versions of the structural
features ((b) vs. (c)) affects how quickly the verb
position features become dominant.
To test the consequences of this proposed infor-
86
mational bottleneck on the relative weighting of
NPattern and VPosition features during training,
we modified the Baby SRL?s training procedure
such that NPattern features were always active, but
VPosition features were active during training only
when the verb in the current example had been en-
countered a critical number of times. This repre-
sents the assumption that the child can recognize
which words in the sentence are nouns, based on
lexical familiarity or morphological context (Wax-
man and Booth, 2001), but is less likely to be able
to represent position relative to the verb without
knowing the verb well.
Figure 1 shows the tendency of the NPattern fea-
ture ? N? (first of two nouns) and the VPosition
feature ? V? (pre-verbal noun) to predict the role
A0 as opposed to A1 as the difference between
the weights of these connections in the learned net-
work. Figure 1(a) shows the results when VPosi-
tion features were active whenever the target verb
had occurred at least 5 times; in Figure 1(b) the
threshold for verb familiarity was 20. In both fig-
ures we see that the VPosition features win out
over the NPattern features as the verb vocabulary
grows. Varying the degree of verb familiarity re-
quired to accurately represent VPosition features
affects how quickly the VPosition features win
out (compare Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Figure 1(c)
shows the same analysis with a threshold of 20,
but with verb-specific as well as abstract versions
of the NPattern and the VPosition features. In this
procedure, every example started with three fea-
tures: target noun, target predicate, NPattern, and
if the verb was known, added NPattern&V, VPo-
sition, and VPosition&V. Comparing Figures 1(b)
and 1(c), we see that the addition of verb-specific
versions of the structural features also affects the
rate at which the VPosition features come to dom-
inate the NPattern features.
Thus, in training the VPosition features become
dominant as the SRL learns to recognize more
verbs. However, the VPosition features are inac-
tive when the Baby SRL encounters the novel-verb
test sentences. Since the NPattern features are ac-
tive in test, the system generates the predicted error
until the bias of the NPattern features reaches 0.
Note in figure 1(c) that when verb-specific struc-
tural features were added, the Baby SRL never
learned to entirely discount the NPattern features
within the range of training provided. This result
is reminiscent of suggestions in the psycholinguis-

Figure 2: Testing the ability of simple features
to cope with varying amounts of noisy feedback.
Even with noisy feedback, the noun pattern fea-
tures support learning and generalization to new
verbs of a simple agent-patient template for un-
derstanding transitive sentences. These results are
lower than those found in table 1 due to slightly
different training assumptions.
tics literature that shallow representations of syn-
tax persist in the adult parser, alongside more so-
phisticated representations (e.g., (Ferreira, 2003)).
3.7 Noisy Training
So far, the Baby SRL has only been trained with
perfect feedback. Theories of human language ac-
quisition assume that learning to understand sen-
tences is naturally a partially-supervised task: the
child uses existing knowledge of words and syntax
to assign a meaning to a sentence; the appropriate-
ness of this meaning for the referential context pro-
vides the feedback (e.g., (Pinker, 1989)). But this
feedback must be noisy. Referential scenes pro-
vide useful but often ambiguous information about
the semantic roles of sentence participants. For ex-
ample, a participant could be construed as an agent
of fleeing or as a patient being chased. In a final
set of experiments, we examined the generaliza-
tion abilities of the Baby SRL as a function of the
integrity of semantic feedback.
We provided noisy semantic-role feedback dur-
ing training by giving a randomly-selected argu-
ment label on 0 to 100% of examples. Following
this training, we tested with the ?A gorps B? test
sentences, using the unbiased noun choices.
As shown in Figure 2, feature sets including
NPattern or VPosition features yield reasonable
performance on the novel verb test sentences up to
50% noise, and promote an A0-A1 sequence over
87
the words-only baseline even at higher noise lev-
els. Thus the proposed simple structural features
are robust to noisy feedback.
4 Conclusion
The simplified SRL classifier mimicked experi-
mental results with toddlers. We structured the
learning task to ask whether shallow representa-
tions of sentence structure provided a useful ini-
tial representation for learning to interpret sen-
tences. Given representations of the number and
order of nouns in the sentence (noun pattern fea-
tures), the Baby SRL learned to classify the first
of two nouns as an agent and the second as a pa-
tient. When provided with both verb-general and
verb-specific noun pattern features, the Baby SRL
learned to balance verb-specific and abstract syn-
tactic knowledge. By treating each noun as an
argument, it also reproduced the errors children
make. Crucially, verb-position features improved
performance when added to the noun-pattern fea-
ture, but when presented alone failed to produce
the error found with toddlers. We believe that
our model can be naturally extended to support
the case in which the arguments are noun phrases
rather than single noun words and this extension is
one of the first steps we will explore next.
