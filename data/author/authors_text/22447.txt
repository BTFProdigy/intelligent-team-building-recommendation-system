Abstract
We propose a new Chinese abbreviation
prediction method which can incorporate
rich local information while generating the
abbreviation globally. Different to previ-
ous character tagging methods, we intro-
duce the minimum semantic unit, which is
more fine-grained than character but more
coarse-grained than word, to capture word
level information in the sequence labeling
framework. To solve the ?character dupli-
cation? problem in Chinese abbreviation
prediction, we also use a substring tagging
strategy to generate local substring tagging
candidates. We use an integer linear pro-
gramming (ILP) formulation with various
constraints to globally decode the final ab-
breviation from the generated candidates.
Experiments show that our method outper-
forms the state-of-the-art systems, without
using any extra resource.
1 Introduction
Abbreviation is defined as a shortened description
of the original fully expanded form. For example,
?NLP? is the abbreviation for the corresponding
full form ?Natural Language Processing?. The ex-
istence of abbreviations makes it difficult to iden-
tify the terms conveying the same concept in the
information retrieval (IR) systems and machine
translation (MT) systems. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to maintain a dictionary of the prevalent orig-
inal full forms and the corresponding abbrevia-
tions.
Previous works on Chinese abbreviation gen-
eration focus on the sequence labeling method,
which give each character in the full form an extra
label to indicate whether it is kept in the abbre-
viation. One drawback of the character tagging
strategy is that Chinese characters only contain
limited amount of information. Using character-
based method alone is not enough for Chinese ab-
breviation generation. Intuitively we can think of a
word as the basic tagging unit to incorporate more
information. However, if the basic tagging unit
is word, we need to design lots of tags to repre-
sent which characters are kept for each unit. For a
word with n characters, we should design at least
2
n
labels to cover all possible situations. This re-
duces the generalization ability of the proposed
model. Besides, the Chinese word segmentation
errors may also hurt the performance. Therefore
we propose the idea of ?Minimum Semantic Unit?
(MSU) which is the minimum semantic unit in
Chinese language. Some of the MSUs are words,
while others are more fine-grained than words.
The task of selecting representative characters in
the full form can be further broken down into se-
lecting representative characters in the MSUs. We
model this using the MSU-based tagging method,
which can both utilize semantic information while
keeping the tag set small.
Meanwhile, the sequence labeling method per-
forms badly when the ?character duplication? phe-
nomenon exists. Many Chinese long phrases con-
tain duplicated characters, which we refer to as
the ?character duplication? phenomenon. There is
no sound criterion for the character tagging mod-
els to decide which of the duplicated character
should be kept in the abbreviation and which one
to be skipped. An example is ????????
??(Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astro-
nautics) whose abbreviation is ????. The char-
acter ??? appears twice in the full form and only
one is kept in the abbreviation. In these cases, we
can break the long phase into local substrings. We
can find the representative characters in the sub-
strings instead of the long full form and let the de-
coding phase to integrate useful information glob-
ally. We utilize this sub-string based approach and
obtain this local tagging information by labeling
1405
on the sub-string of the full character sequence.
Given the MSU-based and substring-based
methods mentioned above, we can get a list of
potential abbreviation candidates. Some of these
candidates may not agree on keeping or skipping
of some specific characters. To integrate their ad-
vantages while considering the consistency, we
further propose a global decoding strategy using
Integer Linear Programming(ILP). The constraints
in ILP can naturally incorporate ?non-local? infor-
mation in contrast to probabilistic constraints that
are estimated from training examples. We can also
use linguistic constraints like ?adjacent identical
characters is not allowed? to decode the correct
abbreviation in examples like the previous ????
example.
Experiments show that our Chinese abbrevia-
tion prediction system outperforms the state-of-
the-art systems. In order to reduce the size of
the search space, we further propose pruning con-
straints that are learnt from the training corpus.
Experiment shows that the average number of con-
straints is reduced by about 30%, while the top-1
accuracy is not affected.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 1
gives the introduction. In section 2 we describe
our method, including the MSUs, the substring-
based tagging strategy and the ILP decoding pro-
cess. Experiments are described in section 3. We
also give a detailed analysis of the results in sec-
tion 3. In section 4 related works are introduced,
and the paper is concluded in the last section.
2 System Architecture
2.1 Chinese Abbreviation Prediction
Chinese abbreviations are generated by selecting
representative characters from the full forms. For
example, the abbreviation of ?????? (Peking
University) is ???? which is generated by se-
lecting the first and third characters, see TABLE
1. This can be tackled from the sequence labeling
point of view.
Full form ? ? ? ?
Status Keep Skip Keep Skip
Result ? ?
Table 1: The abbreviation ???? of the full form
?????? (Peking University)
From TABLE 1 we can see that Chinese abbre-
viation prediction is a problem of selecting repre-
sentative characters from the original full form
1
.
Based on this assumption, previous works mainly
focus on this character tagging schema. In these
methods, the basic tagging unit is the Chinese
character. Each character in the full form is la-
beled as ?K? or ?S?, where ?K? means the current
character should be kept in abbreviation and ?S?
means the current character should be skipped.
However, a Chinese character can only contain
limited amount of information. Using character-
based method alone is not enough for Chinese
abbreviation generation. We introduce an MSU-
based method, which models the process of se-
lecting representative characters given local MSU
information.
2.2 MSU Based Tagging
2.2.1 Minimum Semantic Unit
Because using the character-based method is not
enough for Chinese abbreviation generation, we
may think of word as the basic tagging unit to in-
corporate more information intuitively. In English,
the abbreviations (similar to acronyms) are usually
formed by concatenating initial letters or parts of a
series of words. In other words, English abbrevia-
tion generation is based on words in the full form.
However, in Chinese, word is not the most suit-
able abbreviating unit. Firstly, there is no natural
boundary between Chinese words. Errors from the
Chinese word segmentation tools will accumulate
to harm the performance of abbreviation predic-
tion. Second, it is hard to design a reasonable tag
set when the length of a possible Chinese word is
very long. The second column of TABLE 2 shows
different ways of selecting representative charac-
ters of Chinese words with length 3. For a Chi-
nese compound word with 3 characters, there are 6
possible ways to select characters. In this case we
should have at least 6 kinds of tags to cover all pos-
sible situations. The case is even worse for words
with more complicated structures. A suitable ab-
breviating unit should be smaller than word.
We propose the ?Minimum Semantic Unit
(MSU)? as the basic tagging unit. We define MSU
as follows:
1. A word whose length is less or equal to 2 is
an MSU.
1
A small portion of Chinese abbreviations are not gener-
ated from the full form. For example, the abbreviation of ??
??(Shan Dong Province) is ???. However, we can use a
look-up table to get this kind of abbreviations.
1406
Full form SK Label MSUs
???(nursery) ?/K?/S?/S ??+?
???(allowance) ?/S?/K?/S ??+?
???(Credit card) ?/S?/S?/K ??+?
???(Hydropower Station) ?/K?/K?/S ?+?+?
???(Senate) ?/K?/S?/K ?+?+?
???(Music group) ?/S?/K?/K ??+?
Table 2: Representing characters of Chinese words with length 3 (K for keep and S for skip) and the
corresponding MSUs
2. A word whose length is larger than 2, but
does not contain any MSUs with length equal
to 2. For example, ?????(Railway Sta-
tion) is not an MSU because the first two
characters ????(Train) can form an MSU.
By this definition, all 6 strings in TABLE 2 are
often thought as a word, but they are not MSUs
in our view. Their corresponding MSU forms are
shown in TABLE 2.
We collect all the MSUs from the benchmark
datasets provided by the second International Chi-
nese Word Segmentation Bakeoff
2
. We choose the
Peking University (PKU) data because it is more
fine-grained than all other corpora. Suppose we
represent the segmented data as L (In our case L
is the PKU word segmentation data), the MSU se-
lecting algorithm is shown in TABLE 3.
For a given full form, we first segment it us-
ing a standard word segmenter to get a coarse-
grained segmentation result. Here we use the Stan-
ford Chinese Word Segmenter
3
. Then we use the
MSU set to segment each word using the strategy
of ?Maximum Forward Matching?
4
to get the fine-
grained MSU segmentation result.
2.2.2 Labeling strategy
For MSU-based tagging, we use a labeling method
which uses four tags, ?KSFL?. ?K? stands for
?Keep the whole unit?, ?S? stands for ?Skip the
whole unit?, ?F? stands for ?keep the First charac-
ter of the unit?, and Label ?L? stands for ?keep the
Last character of the unit?. An example is shown
in TABLE 4.
The ?KSFL? tag set is also applicable for MSUs
whose length is greater than 2 (an example is ??
??/chocolate?). By examining the corpus we
find that such MSUs are either kept of skipped in

In Chinese, ?Forward? means from left to right.

breviation is ??????)

mittee) based on MSU tagging.
the final abbreviations. Therefore, the labels of
these long MSUs are either ?K? or ?S?. Empirically,
this assumption holds for MSUs, but does not hold
for words
5
.
2.2.3 Feature templates
The feature templates we use are as follows. See
TABLE 5.
1. Word X
i
(?2 ? i ? 2)
2. POS tag of word X
i
(?2 ? i ? 2)
3. Word Bigrams (X
i
, X
i+1
) (?2 ? i ? 1)
4. Type of word X
i
(?2 ? i ? 2)
5. Length of word X
i
(?2 ? i ? 2)
Table 5: Feature templates for unit tagging. X
represents the MSU sequence of the full form. X
i
represents the ith MSU in the sequence.
Templates 1, 2 and 3 express word uni-grams
and bi-grams. In MSU-based tagging, we can uti-
lize the POS information, which we get from the
Stanford Chinese POS Tagger
6
. In template 4, the
type of word refers to whether it is a number, an
English word or a Chinese word. Because the ba-
sic tagging unit is MSU, which carries word infor-
mation, we can use many features that are infeasi-
ble in character-based tagging.

In table 2, all examples are partly kept.

Add w to MSUSet
End if
End for
Return MSUSet

2.2.4 Sequence Labeling Model
The MSU-based method gives each MSU an ex-
tra indicative label. Therefore any sequence label-
ing model is appropriate for the method. Previous
works showed that Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) can outperform other sequence labeling
models like MEMMs in abbreviation generation
tasks (Sun et al., 2009; Tsuruoka et al., 2005). For
this reason we choose CRFs model in our system.
For a given full form?s MSU list, many can-
didate abbreviations are generated by choosing
the k-best results of the CRFs. We can use the
forward-backward algorithm to calculate the prob-
ability of a specified tagging result. To reduce the
searching complexity in the ILP decoding process,
we delete those candidate tagged sequences with
low probability.
2.3 Substring Based Tagging
As mentioned in the introduction, the sequence
labeling method, no matter character-based or
MSU-based, perform badly when the ?character
duplication? phenomenon exists. When the full
form contains duplicated characters, there is no
sound criterion for the sequence tagging strategy
to decide which of the duplicated character should
be kept in the abbreviation and which one to be
skipped. On the other hand, we can tag the sub-
strings of the full form to find the local represen-
tative characters in the substrings of the long full
form. Therefore, we propose the sub-string based
approach to given labeling results on sub-strings.
These results can be integrated into a more accu-
rate result using ILP constraints, which we will de-
scribe in the next section.
Another reason for using the sub-string based
methods is that long full forms contain more char-
acters and are much easier to make mistakes dur-
ing the sequence labeling phase. Zhang et al.
(2012) shows that if the full form contains less
than 5 characters, a simple tagger can reach an ac-
curacy of 70%. Zhang et al. (2012) also shows that
if the full form is longer than 10 characters, the
average accuracy is less than 30%. The numerous
potential candidates make it hard for the tagger to
choose the correct one. For the long full forms,
although the whole sequence is not correctly la-
beled, we find that if we only consider its short
substrings, we may find the correct representative
characters. This information can be integrated into
the decoding model to adjust the final result.
We use the MSU-based tagging method in the
sub-string tagging. The labeling strategy and fea-
ture templates are the same to the MSU-based tag-
ging method. In practice, enumerating all sub-
sequences of a given full form is infeasible if the
full form is very long. For a given full form,
we use the boundary MSUs to reduce the pos-
sible sub-sequence set. For example, ????
???(Chinese Academy of Science) has 5 sub-
sequences: ????, ??????, ????, ???
?? and ???.
2.4 ILP Formulation of Decoding
Given the MSU-based and sub-sequence-based
methods mentioned above as well as the preva-
lent character-based methods, we can get a list
of potential abbreviation candidates and abbrevi-
ated substrings. We should integrate their advan-
tages while keeping the consistency between each
1408
candidate. Therefore we further propose a global
decoding strategy using Integer Linear Program-
ming(ILP). The constraints in ILP can naturally
incorporate ?non-local? information in contrast to
probabilistic constraints that are estimated from
training examples. We can also use linguistic con-
straints like ?adjacent identical characters is not
allowed? to decode the correct abbreviation in ex-
amples like the ???? example in section 1.
Formally, given the character sequence of the
full form c = c
1
...c
l
, we keep Q top-ranked
MSU-based tagging results T=(T
1
, ..., T
Q
) and M
tagged substrings S=(S
1
, ..., S
M
) using the meth-
ods described in previous sections. We also
use N top-ranked character-based tagging results
R=(R
1
, ..., R
N
) based on the previous character-
based works. We also define the setU = S?R?T
as the union of all candidate sequences. Our goal
is to find an optimal binary variable vector solution
~v = ~x~y~z = (x
1
, ..., x
M
, y
1
, ..., y
N
, z
1
, ..., z
Q
) that
maximizes the object function:
?

M
?
i=1
score(S
i
) ? x
i
+ ?
2
N

score(R
i
) ? y
i
+?
3
Q
?
i=1
score(T
i
) ? z
i
subject to constrains in TABLE 6. The parame-
ters ?
1
, ?
2
, ?
3
controls the preference of the three
parts, and can be decided using cross-validation.
Constraint 1 indicates that x
i
, y
i
, z
i
are all
boolean variables. They are used as indicator vari-
ables to show whether the corresponding tagged
sequence is in accordance with the final result.
Constraint 2 is used to guarantee that at most
one candidate from the character-based tagging is
preserved. We relax the constraint to allow the
sum to be zero in case that none of the top-ranked
candidate is suitable to be the final result. If the
sum equals zero, then the sub-sequence based tag-
ging method will generate a more suitable result.
Constrain 3 has the same utility for the MSU-
based tagging.
Constraint 4, 5, 6 are inter-method constraints.
We use them to guarantee that the labels of the
preserved sequences of different tagging methods
do not conflict with each other. Constraint 7 is
used to guarantee that the labels of the preserved
sub-strings do not conflict with each other.
Constraint 8 is used to solve the ?character du-
plicate? problem. When two identical characters
are kept adjacently, only one of them will be kept.
Which one will be kept depends on the global de-
coding score. This is the advantage of ILP against
traditional sequence labeling methods.
2.5 Pruning Constraints
The efficiency of solving the ILP decoding prob-
lem depends on the number of candidate tagging
sequences N and Q, as well as the number of sub-
sequences M. Usually, N and Q is less than 10 in
our experiment. Therefore, M influences the time
complexity the most. Because we use the bound-
ary of MSUs instead of enumerating all possible
subsequences, the value of M can be largely re-
duced.
Some characters are always labeled as ?S? or
?K? once the context is given. We can use this
phenomenon to reduce the search space of decod-
ing. Let c
i
denote the i
th
character relative to the
current character c
0
and t
i
denote the tag of c
i
. The
context templates we use are listed in TABLE 7.
Uni-gram Contexts c

, c

Bi-gram Contexts c

c0, c
?1

, c

Table 7: Context templates used in pruning
With respect to a training corpus, if a context
C relative to c
0
always assigns a certain tag t to
c
0
, then we can use this constraint in pruning. We
judge the degree of ?always? by checking whether
count(C?t
0
=t)
count(C)
> threshold. The threshold is a
non-negative real number under 1.0.
3 Experiments
3.1 Data and Evaluation Metric
We use the abbreviation corpus provided by Insti-
tute of Computational Linguistics (ICL) of Peking
University in our experiments. The corpus is sim-
ilar to the corpus used in Sun et al. (2008, 2009);
Zhang et al. (2012). It contains 8, 015 Chinese ab-
breviations, including noun phrases, organization
names and some other types. Some examples are
presented in TABLE 8. We use 80% abbreviations
as training data and the rest as testing data. In
some cases, a long phrase may contain more than
one abbreviation. For these cases, the corpus just
keeps their most commonly used abbreviation for
each full form.
The evaluation metric used in our experiment
is the top-K accuracy, which is also used by
Tsuruoka et al. (2005), Sun et al. (2009) and

Zhang et al. (2012). The top-K accuracy measures
what percentage of the reference abbreviations are
found if we take the top N candidate abbreviations
from all the results. In our experiment, top-10 can-
didates are considered in re-ranking phrase and the
measurement used is top-1 accuracy (which is the
accuracy we usually refer to) because the final aim
of the algorithm is to detect the exact abbreviation.
CRF++

, an open source linear chain CRF tool,
is used in the sequence labeling part. For ILP part,
we use lpsolve
8
, which is also an open source tool.
The parameters of these tools are tuned through
cross-validation on the training data.
3.2 Results
TABLE 9 shows the top-K accuracy of the
character-based and MSU-based method. We can
see that the MSU-based tagging method can uti-
lize word information, which can get better perfor-
mance than the character-based method. We can
also figure out that the top-5 candidates include the
reference abbreviation for most full forms. There-
fore reasonable decoding by considering all possi-
ble labeling of sequences may improve the perfor-
mance. Although the MSU-based methods only
outperforms character-based methods by 0.75%
7
http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/

http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/
for top-1 accuracy, it is much better when consid-
ering top-2 to top-5 accuracy (+2.5%). We further
select the top-ranked candidates for ILP decod-
ing. Therefore the MSU-based method can further
improve the performance in the global decoding
phase.

Table 9: Top-K (K ? 5) results of character-based

We then use the top-5 candidates of character-
based method and MSU-based method, as well
as the top-2 results of sub-sequence labeling in
the ILP decoding phase. Then we select the top-
ranked candidate as the final abbreviation of each
instance. TABLE 10 shows the results. We can see
that the accuracy of our method is 61.0%, which
improved by +3.89% compared to the character-
based method, and +3.14% compared to the MSU-
based method.

3.3 Improvements Considering Length
Full forms that are longer than five characters are
long terms. Long terms contain more characters,
which is much easier to make mistakes. Figure
1 shows the top-1 accuracy respect to the term
length using different tagging methods and using
ILP decoding. The x-axis represents the length of
the full form. The y-axis represents top-1 accu-
racy. We find that our method works especially
better than pure character-based or MSU-based
approach when the full form is long. By decod-
ing using ILP, both local and global information
are incorporated. Therefore many of these errors
can be eliminated.

considering length
3.4 Effect of pruning
As discussed in previous sections, if we are able
to pre-determine that some characters in a certain
context should be kept or skipped, then the num-
ber of possible boolean variable x can be reduced.
TABLE 14 shows the differences. To guarantee
a high accuracy, we set the threshold to be 0.99.
When the original full form is partially tagged by
the pruning constraints, the number of boolean
variables per full form is reduced from 34.4 to
25.5. By doing this, we can improve the predic-
tion speed over taking the raw input.
From TABLE 14 we can also see that the top-
1 accuracy is not affected by these pruning con-
straints. This is obvious, because CRF itself has
a strong modeling ability. The pruning constraints
cannot improve the model accuracy. But they can
help eliminate those false candidates to make the
ILP decoding faster.

We also compare our method with previous meth-
ods, including Sun et al. (2009) and Zhang et al.
(2012). Because we use a different corpus, we
re-implement the system Sun et al. (2009), Zhang
1411
et al. (2012) and Sun et al. (2013), and experi-
ment on our corpus. The first two are CRF+GI
and DPLVM+GI in Sun et al. (2009), which are
reported to outperform the methods in Tsuruoka
et al. (2005) and Sun et al. (2008). For DPLVM
we use the same model in Sun et al. (2009) and
experiment on our own data. We also compare
our approach with the method in Zhang et al.
(2012). However, Zhang et al. (2012) uses dif-
ferent sources of search engine result information
to re-rank the original candidates. We do not use
any extra web resources. Because Zhang et al.
(2012) uses web information only in its second
stage, we use ?BIEP?(the tag set used by Zhang
et al. (2012)) to denote the first stage of Zhang
et al. (2012), which also uses no web information.
TABLE 15 shows the results of the comparisons.
We can see that our method outperforms all other
methods which use no extra resource. Because
Zhang et al. (2012) uses extra web resource, the
top-1 accuracy of Zhang et al. (2012) is slightly
better than ours.

4 Related Work
Previous research mainly focuses on ?abbrevia-
tion disambiguation?, and machine learning ap-
proaches are commonly used (Park and Byrd,
2001; HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2008; Yu et al.,
2006; Ao and Takagi, 2005). These ways of link-
ing abbreviation pairs are effective, however, they
cannot solve our problem directly. In many cases
the full form is definite while we don?t know the
corresponding abbreviation.
To solve this problem, some approaches main-
tain a database of abbreviations and their corre-
sponding ?full form? pairs. The major problem
of pure database-building approach is obvious. It
is impossible to cover all abbreviations, and the
building process is quit laborious. To find these
pairs automatically, a powerful approach is to find
the reference for a full form given the context,
which is referred to as ?abbreviation generation?.
There is research on heuristic rules for gen-
erating abbreviations Barrett and Grems (1960);
Bourne and Ford (1961); Taghva and Gilbreth
(1999); Park and Byrd (2001); Wren et al. (2002);
Hearst (2003). Most of them achieved high per-
formance. However, hand-crafted rules are time
consuming to create, and it is not easy to transfer
the knowledge of rules from one language to an-
other.
Recent studies of abbreviation generation have
focused on the use of machine learning tech-
niques. Sun et al. (2008) proposed a supervised
learning approach by using SVM model. Tsu-
ruoka et al. (2005); Sun et al. (2009) formal-
ized the process of abbreviation generation as a
sequence labeling problem. In Tsuruoka et al.
(2005) each character in the full form is associated
with a binary value label y, which takes the value
S (Skip) if the character is not in the abbreviation,
and value P (Preserve) if the character is in the ab-
breviation. Then a MEMM model is used to model
the generating process. Sun et al. (2009) followed
this schema but used DPLVM model to incor-
porate both local and global information, which
yields better results. Sun et al. (2013) also uses
machine learning based methods, but focuses on
the negative full form problem, which is a little
different from our work.
Besides these pure statistical approaches, there
are also many approaches using Web as a corpus
in machine learning approaches for generating ab-
breviations.Adar (2004) proposed methods to de-
tect such pairs from biomedical documents. Jain
et al. (2007) used web search results as well as
search logs to find and rank abbreviates full pairs,
which show good result. The disadvantage is that
search log data is only available in a search en-
gine backend. The ordinary approaches do not
have access to search engine internals. Zhang et al.
(2012) used web search engine information to re-
rank the candidate abbreviations generated by sta-
tistical approaches. Compared to their approaches,
our method uses no extra resource, but reaches
comparable results.
ILP shows good results in many NLP tasks.
Punyakanok et al. (2004); Roth and Yih (2005)
used it in semantic role labeling (SRL). Martins
et al. (2009) used it in dependency parsing. (Zhao
and Marcus, 2012) used it in Chinese word seg-
mentation. (Riedel and Clarke, 2006) used ILP
1412
in dependency parsing. However, previous works
mainly focus on the constraints of avoiding bound-
ary confliction. For example, in SRL, two argu-
ment of cannot overlap. In CWS, two Chinese
words cannot share a same character. Different to
their methods, we investigate on the conflict of la-
bels of character sub-sequences.
5 Conclusion and Future work
We propose a new Chinese abbreviation predic-
tion method which can incorporate rich local in-
formation while generating the abbreviation glob-
ally. We propose the MSU, which is more coarse-
grained than character but more fine-grained than
word, to capture word information in the se-
quence labeling framework. Besides the MSU-
based method, we use a substring tagging strategy
to generate local substring tagging candidates. We
use an ILP formulation with various constraints
to globally decode the final abbreviation from the
generated candidates. Experiments show that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems,
without using any extra resource. This method
is not limited to Chinese abbreviation generation,
it can also be applied to similar languages like
Japanese.
The results are promising and outperform the
baseline methods. The accuracy can still be im-
proved. Potential future works may include using
semi-supervised methods to incorporate unlabeled
data and design reasonable features from large cor-
pora. We are going to study on these issues in the
future.

Abstract
Multi-label text categorization (MTC) is
supervised learning, where a documen-
t may be assigned with multiple categories
(labels) simultaneously. The labels in the
MTC are correlated and the correlation re-
sults in some hidden components, which
represent the ?share? variance of correlat-
ed labels. In this paper, we propose a
method with hidden components for MTC.
The proposed method employs PCA to
capture the hidden components, and incor-
porates them into a joint learning frame-
work to improve the performance. Experi-
ments with real-world data sets and evalu-
ation metrics validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.
1 Introduction
Many real-world text categorization applications
are multi-label text categorization (Srivastava and
Zane-Ulman, 2005; Katakis et al., 2008; Rubin
et al., 2012; Nam et al., 2013), where a docu-
ments is usually assigned with multiple labels si-
multaneously. For example, as figure 1 shows,
a newspaper article concerning global warming
can be classified into two categories, Environmen-
t, and Science simultaneously. Let X = R
d
be the documents corpus, and Y = {0, 1}
m
be
the label space with m labels. We denote by
{(x
1
, y
1
), (x
2
, y
2
), ..., (x
n
, y
n
)} the training set of
n documents. Each document is denoted by a vec-
tor x
i
= [x
i,1
, x
i,2
, ..., x
i,d
] of d dimensions. The
labeling of the i-th document is denoted by vector
y
i
= [y
i,1
, y
i,2
, ..., y
i,m
], where y
il
is 1 when the
i-th document has the l-th label and 0 otherwise.
The goal is to learn a function f : X ? Y . Gener-
ally, we can assume f consists of m functions, one
for a label.
f = [f
1
, f
2
, ..., f
m
]
Figure 1: A newspaper article concerning global
warming can be classified into two categories, En-
vironment, and Science.
The labels in the MLC are correlated. For ex-
ample, a ?politics? document is likely to be an ?e-
conomic? document simultaneously, but likely not
to be a ?literature? document. According to the
latent variable model (Tabachnick et al., 2001),
the labels with correlation result in some hidden
components, which represent the ?share? variance
of correlated labels. Intuitively, if we can capture
and utilize these hidden components in MTC, the
performance will be improved. To implement this
idea, we propose a multi- label text categorization
method with hidden components, which employ
PCA to capture the hidden components, and then
incorporates these hidden components into a joint
learning framework. Experiments with various da-
ta sets and evaluation metrics validate the values
of our method. The research close to our work is
ML-LOC (Multi-Label learning using LOcal Cor-
relation) in (Huang and Zhou, 2012). The differ-
1816
ences between ours and ML-LOC is that ML-LOC
employs the cluster method to gain the local cor-
relation, but we employ the PCA to obtain the hid-
den code. Meanwhile, ML-LOC uses the linear
programming in learning the local code, but we
employ the gradient descent method since we add
non-linear function to the hidden code.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the proposed method. We con-
duct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method in section 3. Section 4
concludes this paper.
2 Methodology
2.1 Capturing Hidden Component via
Principle Component Analysis
The first step of the proposed method is to capture
hidden components of training instances. Here we
employ Principal component analysis (PCA). This
is because PCA is a well-known statistical tool that
converts a set of observations of possibly correlat-
ed variables into a set of values of linearly uncorre-
lated variables called principle components. These
principle components represent the inner structure
of the correlated variables.
In this paper, we directly employ PCA to con-
vert labels of training instances into their principle
components, and take these principle components
as hidden components of training instances. We
denote by h
i
the hidden components of the i-th in-
stance captured by PCA.
2.2 Joint Learning Framework
We expand the original feature representation of
the instance x
i
by its hidden component code vec-
tor c
i
. For simplicity, we use logistic regression as
the motivating example. Let w
l
denote weights in
the l-th function f
l
, consisting of two parts: 1)w
x
l
is the part involving the instance features. 2) w
c
l
is the part involving the hidden component codes.
Hence f
l
is:
f
l
(x,c) =
1
1 + exp(?x
T
w
x
l
? c
T
w
c
l
)
(1)
where C is the code vectors set of all training in-
stances.
The natural choice of the code vector c is h.
However, when testing an instance, the labeling is
unknown (exactly what we try to predict), conse-
quently we can not capture h with PCA to replace
the code vector c in the prediction function Eq.(1).
Therefore, we assume a linear transformation M
from the training instances to their independent
components, and use Mx as the approximate in-
dependent component. For numerical stability, we
add a non-linear function (e.g., the tanh function)
toMx. This is formulated as follows.
c = tanh(Mx) (2)
Aiming to the discrimination fitting and the in-
dependent components encoding, we optimize the
following optimization problem.

Z(C) (3)
The first term of Eq.(3) is the loss function. `
is the loss function defined on the training data,
and W denotes all weights in the our model, i.e.,
w
1
, ...,w
l
, ...,w
m
. Since we utilize the logistic re-
gression in our model, the loss function is defined
as follows.
`(x,c, y, f)
= ?ylnf(x,c)? (1? y)ln(1? f(x,c)) (4)
The second term of Eq.(3) ? is to punish the
model complexity, which we use the `
2
regular-
ization term.
?(f ) =
m
?
l=1
||w
l
||
2
. (5)
The third term of Eq.(3) Z is to enforce the code
vector close to the independent component vector.
To obtain the goal, we use the least square error
between the code vector and the independent com-
ponent vector as the third regularized term.
Z(C) =
n
?
i=1
||c
i

By substituting the Eq.(5) and Eq.(6) into Eq.(3)
and changing c to tanh(Mx) (Eq.(2)), we obtain
the following optimization problem.

2.3 Alternative Optimization method
We solve the optimization problem in Eq.(7) by
the alternative optimization method, which opti-
mize one group of the two parameters with the
other fixed. When the M fixed, the third term of
Eq.(7) is a constant and thus can be ignored, then
Eq.(7) can be rewritten as follows.

By decomposing Eq.(8) based on the label, the e-
quation Eq.(8) can be simplified to:

(9)
Eq.(9) is the standard logistic regression, which
has many efficient optimization algorithms.
When W fixed, the second term is constan-
t and can be omitted, then Ep.(7) can rewritten
to Eq.(10). We can apply the gradient descen-
t method to optimize this problem.

3 Experiments
3.1 Evaluation Metrics
Compared with the single-label classification, the
multi-label setting introduces the additional de-
grees of freedom, so that various multi-label eval-
uation metrics are requisite. We use three differen-
t multi-label evaluation metrics, include the ham-
ming loss evaluation metric.
The hamming loss is defined as the percentage
of the wrong labels to the total number of labels.
Hammingloss =
1
m
|h(x)?y| (11)
where ? denotes the symmetric difference of two
sets, equivalent to XOR operator in Boolean logic.
m denotes the label number.
The multi-label 0/1 loss, also known as subset
accuracy, is the exact match measure as it requires
any predicted set of labels h(x) to match the true
set of labels S exactly. The 0/1 loss is defined as
follows:
0/1loss = I(h(x) 6= y) (12)
Let a
j
and r
j
denote the precision and recall for
the j-th label. The macro-averaged F is a harmon-
ic mean between precision and recall, defined as
follows:
F =

3.2 Datasets
We perform experiments on three MTC data sets:
1) the first data set is slashdot (Read et al., 2011).
The slashdot data set is concerned about science
and technology news categorization, which pre-
dicts multiply labels given article titles and partial
blurbs mined from Slashdot.org. 2) the second da-
ta set is medical (Pestian et al., 2007). This data set
involves the assignment of ICD-9-CM codes to ra-
diology reports. 3) the third data set is tmc2007 (S-
rivastava and Zane-Ulman, 2005). It is concerned
about safety report categorization, which is to la-
bel aviation safety reports with respect to what
types of problems they describe. The characteris-
tics of them are shown in Table 1, where n denotes
the size of the data set, d denotes the dimension of
the document instance, and m denotes the number
of labels.

3.3 Compared to Baselines
To examine the values of the joint learning frame-
work, we compare our method to two baselines.
The baseline 1 eliminates the PCA, which just
adds an extra set of non-linear features. To im-
plement this baseline, we only need to set ?
2
= 0.
The baseline 2 eliminates the joint learning frame-
work. This baseline captures the hidden compo-
nent codes with PCA, trains a linear regression
model to fit the hidden component codes, and u-
tilizes the outputs of the linear regression model
as features.
For the proposed method, we set ?
1
= 0.001
and ?
2
= 0.1. For the baseline 2, we employ l-
ogistic regression with 0.001 `2 regularization as
the base classifier. Evaluations are done in ten-
fold cross validation. Note that all of them pro-
duce real-valued predictions. A threshold t needs
to be used to determine the final multi-label set y
such that l

t, which makes the Lcard measure of predictions
for the training set is closest to the Lcard mea-
sure of the training set (Read et al., 2011). The
threshold t is determined as follows, where D

Table 2 reports our method wins over the base-
lines in terms of different evaluation metrics,
which shows the values of PCA and our join-
t learning framework. The hidden component code
only fits the hidden component in the baseline
method. The hidden component code obtains bal-
ance of fitting hidden component and fitting the
training data in the joint learning framework.
3.4 Compared to Other Methods
We compare the proposed method to BR, C-
C (Read et al., 2011), RAKEL (Tsoumakas and
Vlahavas, 2007) and ML-KNN (Zhang and Zhou,
2007). entropy. ML-kNN is an adaption of kNN
algorithm for multilabel classification. methods.
Binary Revelance (BR) is a simple but effective
method that trains binary classifiers for each label
independently. BR has a low time complexity but
makes an arbitrary assumption that the labels are
independent from each other. CC organizes the
classifiers along a chain and take predictions pro-
duced by the former classifiers as features of the
latter classifiers. ML-kNN uses kNN algorithms
independently for each label with considering pri-
or probabilities. The Label Powerset (LP) method
models independencies among labels by treating
each label combination as a new class. LP con-
sumes too much time, since there are 2
m
label
combinations with m labels. RAndom K labEL
(RAKEL) is an ensemble method of LP. RAKEL
learns several LP models with random subsets of
size k from all labels, and then uses a vote process
to determine the final predictions.
For our proposed method, we employ the set-
up in subsection 3.3. We utilize logistic regression
with 0.001 `2 regularization as the base classifier
for BR, CC and RAKEL. For RAKEL, the num-
ber of ensemble is set to the number of label and
the size of the label subset is set to 3. For MLKN-
N, the number of neighbors used in the k-nearest
neighbor algorithm is set to 10 and the smooth pa-
rameter is set to 1. Evaluations are done in ten-
fold cross validation. We employ the threshold-
selection strategy introduced in subsection 3.3
Table 2 also reports the detailed results in terms
of different evaluation metrics. The mean metric
value and the standard deviation of each method
are listed for each data set. We see our proposed
method shows majorities of wining over the other
state-of-the-art methods nearly at all data sets un-
der hamming loss, 0/1 loss and macro f score. E-
specially, under the macro f score, the advantages
of our proposed method over the other methods are
very clear.
4 CONCLUSION
Many real-world text categorization applications
are multi-label text categorization (MTC), where a
documents is usually assigned with multiple labels
simultaneously. The key challenge of MTC is the
label correlations among labels. In this paper, we
propose a MTC method via hidden components
to capture the label correlations. The proposed
method obtains hidden components via PCA and
incorporates them into a joint learning framework.
Experiments with various data sets and evaluation
metrics validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.
