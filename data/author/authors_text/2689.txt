Abstract
This paper proposes a description of
German word order including phe-
nomena considered as complex,
such as scrambling, (partial) VP
fronting and verbal pied piping. Our
description relates a syntactic de-
pendency structure directly to a
topological hierarchy without re-
sorting to movement or similar
mechanisms.1
1 Introduction
The aim of this article is to describe the word
order of German verbs and their comple-
ments. German word order is not free, but
based on fairly simple rules, forming what is
usually called topological model, which sub-
divides the sentence into a hierarchy of topo-
logical domains that are themselves composed
of fields (Vorfeld, Mittelfeld, right bracket?)
(Drach, 1937; Bech, 1955).
We start from a syntactic dependency tree, i.e.
an unordered tree whose nodes are labeled
with the words of the sentence, and whose
branches are labeled with syntactic relations
among the words (subject, direct object?).
The syntactic dependency structure only en-
codes subcategorization and modification and
must be completed by the communicative
structure (partition into theme/rheme, focus?),
which plays a fundamental role in word order.
It permits us to choose among all the different
possible orders corresponding to a given de-
pendency structure. In this paper we do not

 We would like to thank Werner Abraham, Tilman
Becker, Ralph Debusmann, Denys Duchier, and
Stefan M?ller for fruitful discussions.  Particular
thanks to Igor Mel'cuk for the inspiration of the
particular status we give to the phrase structure.
pursue this problem any further, but have
limited our description to the link between
dependency and topology. Note that it is fun-
damental to our approach that syntactic
structure does not include word order.
To get the words in order, we group them in a
hierarchy of phrases. The nature and the posi-
tion of these phrases are constrained by our
topological model. For instance, a non-finite
verb can open two kinds of topological
phrases, either a phrase, which we call domain,
with positions for all of its dependents, or a
restricted phrase, which forms the verb cluster,
with no positions for dependents other than
predicative elements. These two kinds of
phrases must be placed in very different
topological positions.
The fact that we pass through a (topological)
phrase structure in order to relate dependency
and word order distinguishes our approach
from usual dependency grammars (Mel'cuk &
Pertsov, 1987; Br?ker, 1998; Kahane et al,
1998; Duchier & Debusmann, 2001). The
description of German word order closest to
our analysis is the HPSG grammar of Kathol
(1995; see also Reape 1994), who proposes
linearization rules exclusively based on a for-
malization of the topological structure. How-
ever, as required by the formalism he uses, a
regular phrase structure, which we do not need
in our analysis, still underlies the structures
obtained.
Our work constitutes a syntactic module which
links (unordered) syntactic structures with
topological phrase structures. Syntactic struc-
tures are related to semantic structures,
whereas topological phrase structures are re-
lated to phonological structures. In other
words, our work lies within the scope of the
general framework of Meaning-Text-Theory
(Mel'cuk 1988), which considers the modeling
of a language as a modular (bi-directional)
correspondence between meaning and text. It
must be clear that, in contrast to X-bar syntax,
our topological phrase structure does not rep-
resent the syntactic structure of the sentence.
Although the dependency information is es-
sential in its construction, the phrase structure
only represents topology, i.e. the surface
grouping of the words. Topological phrases
can be directly related to prosodic groups, and
topology represents an intermediate level be-
tween dependency and phonology.
In Section 2, the results of our findings are
presented, without recourse to any mathemati-
cal formalism, in the usual terminology of
traditional German grammars. In Section 3, a
mathematical formalism is proposed to state
the rules and the grammar fragment described
in Section 2.
2 Description
Word order in German is much freer than in
English. The dependency tree of Fig. 1, which
will be our reference example, has a few dozen
linearizations:
(1) a.  Niemand hat diesem Mann das Buch
zu lesen versprochen
b. Diesem Mann hat das Buch niemand
zu lesen versprochen
c. Das Buch zu lesen hat diesem Mann
niemand versprochen
d. Diesem Mann hat niemand verspro-
chen, das Buch zu lesen
e. Diesem Mann hat, das Buch zu lesen,
niemand versprochen
f. Zu lesen hat diesem Mann das Buch
niemand versprochen
g. Das Buch hat niemand diesem Mann
versprochen zu lesen
?Nobody promised this man to read the
book.?
Fig. 1. Dependency tree of the sentences in (1)
In this paper, we do not attempt to characterize
well-formed German dependency trees al-
though we recognize that such a characteriza-
tion is essential if we attempt to describe the
acceptable sentences of German.
2.2 Topological model
The internal structure of a domain is a se-
quence of fields. For example, the main do-
main is the underlying pattern of a declarative
sentence, and it consists of the following se-
quence of five fields: [Vorfeld, left bracket,
Mittelfeld, right bracket, Nachfeld]. A domain
resembles a box whose ordered compartments,
called fields, can themselves accommodate
new boxes. In addition to the rules listing the
fields of each type of box, we propose two
further types of rules:
? rules that indicate into which field a word
can go?depending on the position of its
governor;
? rules that indicate which type of box a
word can create when it is placed into a
given field.
The hierarchy of boxes forms the phrase
structure we construct.
2.3 Word order rules
We have established the following rules for the
linear order of verbs and their dependents:
? The finite verb takes the second position
of the main domain, the left bracket. This
verb is also called V2.
? A non-finite verb depending on V2 can
go into the right bracket.2 As a result, it
opens a reduced phrase with only one po-
sition for a verbal dependent (see Section
2.8 for another possibility). If a subse-
quent third verb joins the verb already in
the right bracket, it will again open a
phrase with a position to its left, and so on.
The verbal constituent occupying the right
bracket is called the verb cluster.
? Some non-verbal dependents, such as
separable verbal prefixes (for example the
an of anfangen ?begin?), predicative ad-
jectives, and nouns governed by a copular
verb or a support verb, can go into the
right bracket (the prefix even forms one
word with its following governor). In con-
trast to verbs, these elements do not usu-
ally open up a new position for their de-
pendents, which consequently have to be
placed somewhere else.3
                                                
2
 We consider that in a compound verb form such as
hat gelesen ?has read? the past participle depends
syntactically on the auxiliary, which is the finite verb
form (cf. Tesni?re 1959, Mel'cuk 1988). The V2 is
thus always the root of the syntactic dependency tree.
3
 In examples such as (i), the separable verbal prefix
an behaves like a subordinated verb intervening be-
tween the ?main? verb and its dependent:
hat ?has?
niemand
?noboby?-NOM
dobj
subj aux
das Buch
?the book?-ACC
zu lesen
?to read?
iobj inf
diesem Mann
?this man?-DAT
versprochen
?promised?
? One dependent (verbal or non-verbal) of
any of the verbs of the main domain (V2,
any verb in the right bracket or even an
embedded verb) has to occupy the first
position, called the Vorfeld (VF, pre-
field).
? All the other non-verbal dependents of the
verbs in the domain (V2 or part of the
verbal cluster) can go in the Mittelfeld
(MF, middle-field).
? Some phrases, in particular sentential
complements (complementizer and rela-
tive clauses), prepositional phrases, and
even some sufficiently heavy noun
phrases, can be positioned in a field right
of the right bracket, the Nachfeld (NF, af-
ter-field). Like the Mittelfeld, the Nachfeld
can accommodate several dependents.
? When a verb is placed in any of the Major
Fields (Vor-, Mittel-, Nachfeld), it opens a
new embedded domain.
In the following section we illustrate our rules
with the dependency tree of Fig. 1 and show
how we describe phenomena such as scram-
bling and (partial) VP fronting.
2.4 Non-embedded construction and
?scrambling?
Let us start with cases without embedding, i.e.
where the subordinated verbs versprochen
?promised? and zu lesen ?to read? will go into
the right bracket of the main domain (Fig. 2).
The constituents which occupy the left and
right brackets are represented by shadowed
ovals. The other three phrases, niemand ?no-
body?, diesem Mann ?to this man?, and das
Buch ?the book?, are on the same domain
level; one of them has to take the Vorfeld, the
other two will go into the Mittelfeld. We obtain
thus 6 possible orders, among them (1a) and
(1b). There are nevertheless some general
restrictions on the relative constituent order in
the Mittelfeld. We do not consider these rules
here (see for instance Lennerz 1977, Uszkoreit
1987), but we want to insist on the fact that the
order of the constituents depends very little on
their hierarchical position in the syntactic
structure.4 Even if the order is not free, there
                                                                        
(i) Er f?ngt gleich zu schreien an.
He begins right_away to shout AN.
?He begins to shout right away.?

 Dutch has the same basic topological structure, but
has lost morphological case except on pronouns. For
a simplified description of the order in the Dutch
Mittelfeld, we have to attach to each complement
placed in the Mittelfeld its height in the syntactic
are restrictions that weigh more heavily than
the hierarchical position: pronominalization,
focus, new information, weight, etc.

Fig. 2. A phrase structure without embedded do-
mains for (1a,b)
The fact that a verbal projection (i.e. the verb
and all of its direct and indirect dependents)
does not in general form a continuous phrase,
unlike in English and French, is called scram-
bling (Ross, 1967). This terminology is based
on an erroneous conception of syntax that
supposes that word order is always an immedi-
ate reflection of the syntactic hierarchy (i.e.
every projection of a given element forms a
phrase) and that any deviation from this con-
stitutes a problem. In fact, it makes little sense
to form a phrase for each verb and its depend-
ents. On the contrary, all verbs placed in the
same domain put their dependents in a com-
mon pot. In other words, there is no scram-
bling in German, or more precisely, there is no
advantage in assuming an operation that de-
rives ?scrambled? sentences from ?non-
scrambled? ones.
2.5 Embedding

niemand

Fig. 3. A phrase structure with an embedded
domain for (1a, 1c, 1d, 1e)
                                                                        
dependency tree, and linearize them in descending
order.
As we have said, when a verb is placed in one
of the major fields, it opens an embedded
domain. We represent domains by ovals with a
bold outline. In the situation of Fig. 3, where
zu lesen ?to read? opens an embedded do-
main, hat ?has? and versprochen ?promised?
occupy the left and right bracket of the main
domain and we find three phrases on the same
level: niemand ?nobody?, diesem Mann  ?to
this man?, and das Buch zu lesen ?to read the
book?. The embedded domain can go into the
Vorfeld (1c), the Nachfeld (1d), or the Mit-
telfeld (1a,e).
Note that we obtain the word order (1a) a sec-
ond time, giving us two phrase structures:
 (2) a. [Niemand] [hat] [diesem Mann] [das
Buch zu lesen] [versprochen]
b. [Niemand] [hat] [diesem Mann] [das
Buch] [zu lesen versprochen]
This structural ambiguity corresponds, we
believe, to a semantic ambiguity of communi-
cative type: In (2a), the fact of reading the
book is marked (as in Reading the book, no-
body promised him that), whereas (2b) is neu-
tral in this respect (Nobody promised him to
read the book).
Moreover, the structures (2a) and (2b) corre-
spond to different prosodies (the left border
of the right bracket is clearly marked with an
accent on the first syllable of the radical).
Finally, the existence of this ambiguity is also
confirmed by the contrast between full infini-
tives (with zu) and bare infinitives (without zu):
Bare infinitives cannot form an embedded
domain outside of the Vorfeld. Consequently,
there are two different prosodies for (3a) (with
or without detachment of das Buch ?the
book? from zu lesen ?to read?), whereas only
one prosody without detachment is permitted
for (3b), although (3a) and (3b) have isomor-
phic dependency trees. Evidence comes also
from the written form recommending a
comma for (3a) (i.e. preference for the em-
bedded structure), whereas the comma is not
allowed for (3b).
 (3) a. Niemand versucht(,) das Buch zu lesen
?Nobody tries to read the book.?
b. Niemand will das Buch lesen
?Nobody wants to read the book.?
2.6 Emancipation
The dependents of a verb do not have to be in
their governor?s domain: They can be ?eman-
cipated? and end up in a superior domain. For
example, in Fig. 4, the verb zu lesen ?to read?
has created an embedded domain from which
its dependent das Buch ?the book? has been
emancipated. We have thus four complements
to place in the superior domain, allowing more
than thirty word orders, among them (1f) and
(1g). Among these orders, only those that
have das Buch or zu lesen in the Vorfeld are
truly acceptable, i.e. those where embedding
and emancipation are communicatively moti-
vated by focus on das Buch or zu lesen.

?to this man?

?the book?
iobj inf
Fig. 4. A phrase structure with emancipation for
(1f,g)
2.8 Word order in the right bracket
German permits different orders inside the
verb cluster. The tense auxiliaries haben
?have? (past) and werden ?become/will? (fu-
ture) also allow their dependents to take a
place on their right in the right bracket
(Oberfeldumstellung or auxiliary flip; Bech,
1955) (4a). The dependents of this verb go
again on the left side of their governor, just as
in standard order (we thus obtain V1V2,
V1V3V2, V1V4V3V2) but it can also join the
place to the left of the auxiliary (we thus ob-
tain the marginal Zwischenstellung V3V1V2(4c), V4V3V1V2).
The governed verbs V2 accepting this inverse
order form a closed class including the modal
and perception verbs and some others (helfen,
?help?, the causative/permissive lassen
?make/let? ? ? haben ?have? itself also allows
this right-placement, which suffices to explain
the cases of ?double flip? as in (4b) giving
V1V2V4V3). Note that the dependent of haben
?have? is the bare infinitive. This form, called
the Ersatzinfinitiv, is also possible or even
preferable for certain verbs when the auxiliary
is in V2 position.
(4) a. Er wird das Buch haben lesen k?nnen.
He will the book have read can.
?He will have been able to read the book.?
b. Ich glaube, dass er das Buch wird ha-
ben lesen k?nnen.
I believe that he the book will have read can.
?I believe that he will have been able to read
the book.?
c. Ich glaube, dass er das Buch lesen wird
k?nnen.
I believe that he the book read will can.
?I believe that he will be able to read the
book.?
In related languages like Dutch or Swiss-
German, which have the same topological
structure, the standard order in the right
bracket is somewhat similar to the German
Oberfeldumstellung. The resulting order gives
rise to cross serial dependencies (Evers 1975,
Bresnan et al 1982) Such constructions have
often been studied for their supposed com-
plexity. With our subsequent description of
the Oberfeldumstellung, we obtain a formal
structure that applies equally to Dutch. Indeed,
the two structures have identical descriptions
with the exception of the relative order of
dependent verbal elements in the right bracket
(keeping in mind that we do not describe the
order of the Mittelfeld).
2.9 Relatives and pied-piping
Relative clauses open an embedded domain
with the main verb going into the right
bracket. The relative pronoun takes the first
position of the domain, but it can take other
elements along (pied-piping) (5). German
differs from English and Romance languages
in that even verbs can be brought along by the
relative pronoun (5b).
 (5) a. Der Mann [[von dem] [Maria] [gek?sst
wird]] liebt sie.
The man [[by whom] [Maria] [kissed is]]
loves her.
b. Das war eine wichtige Einnahmequel-
le, [[die zu erhalten] [sich] [die EU]
[verpflichtet hat]].
This was an important source_of_income,
[[that to conserve] [itself] [the EU] [com-
mited has]].
?This was an important source_of_income,
that the EU obliged itself to conserve.?
Before we discuss the topological structure of
relative clauses, we will discuss their syntactic
representation. Following Tesni?re (1959) and
numerous analyses that have since corrobo-
rated his analysis, we assume that the relative
pronoun plays a double syntactic role:
? On one hand, it has a pronominal role in
the relative clause where it fills a syntactic
position.
? On the other hand, it plays the role of a
complementizer allowing a sentence to
modify a noun.
For this reason, we attribute to the relative
pronoun a double position: as a complemen-
tizer, it is the head of the relative clause and it
therefore depends directly on the antecedent
noun and it governs the main verb of the rela-
tive clause. As a pronoun, it takes its usual
position in the relative clause.

It is now possible to give the word order rules
for relative clauses. The complementizing part
of the relative pronoun opens an embedded
domain consisting of the complementizer field
(Kathol 1995), Mittelfeld, right bracket, and
Nachfeld. The main verb that depends on it
joins the right bracket. The other rules are
identical to those for other domains, with the
group containing the pronominal part of the
relative pronoun having to join the other part
of the pronoun in the complementizer field.
In a sense, the complementizer field acts like
the fusion of the Vorfeld and the left bracket
of the main domain: The complementizing
part of the pronoun, being the root of the
dependency tree of the relative clause, takes
the left bracket (just like the top node of the
whole sentence in the main domain), while the
pronominal part of the relative pronoun takes
the Vorfeld. The fact that the pronoun is one
word requires the fusion of the two parts and
hence of the two fields into one. Note that
verbal pied-piping is very easy to explain in
this analysis: It is just an embedding of a verb
in the complementizer field. Just like the Vor-
feld, the complementizer field can be occu-
pied by a non-verbal phrase or by a verb cre-
ating an embedded domain.
3 Formalization
A grammar in the formalism we introduce in
the following will be called a Topological
Dependency Grammar.
Fig. 5. Dependency and phrase
structure for (5b)
3.1 Definition of the Grammar
For a grammar, the parameters to instantiate
are the vocabulary V, the set of (lexical) cate-
gories C, the set of syntactic relations R, the set
of box names B, the set of field names F, the
initial field i, the order of permeability of the
boxes, which is a partial ordering on B (used
for emancipation) and four sets of rules:5
1.  Box description rules:
The rule b ?  f1 f2 ? fn indicates that the box
b consists of the list of fields f1, f2, ?, fn.
f1   f2      ?      fn
b
2.  Field description rules:
The pair (f,?) in F?{!,?,+,?} indicates that the
field f has to contain exactly one element (!),
at most one element (?), at least one element
(+) or any number of elements (?).
3. Correspondence rules (between the de-
pendency and the topological structure):
The rule (r,c1,c2,f2,b) indicates that a word w2
of category c2, that exhibits a dependency of
type r on a word w1 of category c1, can go
into field f2 of a box containing w1, if this
box is separated from w1 by borders of type ?
b (in other words, the parameter b controls the
emancipation).
c1
b
f2 c2
r
>
(In all our figures, boxes are represented by
ovals, fields by rectangles or sections of an
oval.)
4. Box creation rules:
The rule (c,f,b,f?) indicates that a word of
category c, placed into a field f, can create a
box b and go into the field f? of this box.
Box creation rules are applied recursively until
a lexical rule of type (c,f,b,-) is encountered
where b is a lexical box with a unique lexical
field, into which the word has to be placed.
Phrase structure derivation starting from a
dependency tree
The word labeling the root node of the tree is
placed into the initial field i. Box creation
rules are then activated until the word is placed
                                                
5
 We will not present lexical rules indicating each
lexical entry?s characteristics, in particular its cate-
gory.
in a lexical field (-). A correspondence rule is
activated for one of the dependents of the root
node, placing it in an accessible field. Just as
for the root node, box creation rules are acti-
vated until the word is assigned to a lexical
field. This procedure continues until the whole
tree is used up. Each time a box creation rule
is triggered, a box is created and a description
rule for this box has to be activated. Finally,
the constraints of the field description rules
have to be respected (e.g. a field requiring at
least one element can not remain empty).
3.2 Example of a grammar
We will now instantiate our formalism for the
German grammar fragment described in sec-
tion 2 (leaving aside non-verbal elements in
the right bracket) and we will put forward the
derivation of (1f) with this grammar (Fig.5).

N, X, Y }

with Ersatzinfinitiv, Vfin = finite verb, Vinf
= infinitive with zu, Vbse = base infinitive,
Vpp = past participle, C = complementizer,
X = non-verbal element, Y = anything) ;
R = { r } (we consider a unique syntactic rela-
tion r subsuming all others)
B = { md, ed, cd, vc, vb, v, xp }
(md = main domain, ed = embedded do-
main, cd = comp domain, vc = verbal
cluster, vb = verbal box, v = verb, xp =
non-verbal phrase)

(r, AV?inf, EV, u, -)
                                                
6
 The last parameter (-) indicates that the right
bracket of a given domain is not accessible when
emancipating an element from an embedded domain.
7
 Auxiliaries with zu do not allow auxiliary flip:
(i) ?Er meint das Buch zu haben lesen k?nnen.
He thinks the book to have read can.
Positioning of a non-verbal element in a ma-
jor field:8 (r, V, X, f, ed)
Box creation rules
Creation of the main domain in the initial
field: (Vfin, i, md, [)
Creation of an embedded domain in a major
field: (V?fin, f, ed, ])
Creation of a verbal cluster in the right
bracket or the Unterfeld: (V,]/u,vc, h)
                                                
8
 This last parameter indicates that it is possible to
emancipate out of any type of box inferior to ?ed? in
the order of permeability, i.e. ed, xp, vb or vc, but
not out of cd. Moreover, this rule puts no restric-
tions on the field of the governor. This rule would
have to be refined to account for NP-internal word
order phenomena.
Creation of a verbal box in the Oberfeld:
(V, o, vb, h)
Positioning of a verb: (V, [/h, v, -)
Creation of a non-verbal phrase: (X, f, xp, ?)
Creation of a domain for a relative clause:9
("C", f, cd, "cf")
4 Conclusion
We have shown how to obtain all acceptable
linear orders for German sentences starting
from a syntactic dependency tree. To do that
we have introduced a new formalism which
constructs phrase structures. These structures
differ from X-bar phrase structures in at least
two respects: First, we do not use the phrase
structure to represent the syntactic structure of
the sentence, but only for linearization, i.e. as
an intermediate step between the syntactic and
the phonological levels. Secondly, the nature
of the phrase opened by a lexical element
depends not only on the syntactic position of
this element, but also on its position in the
topological structure (e.g. the different be-
haviors of a verb in the right bracket vs. in a
major field).
We have to investigate further in various di-
rections: From a linguistic point of view, the
natural continuation of our study is to find
out how the communicative structure (which
completes the dependency tree) restricts us to
certain word orders and prosodies and how to
incorporate this into our linearization rules. It
would also be interesting to attempt to de-
scribe other languages in this formalism, con-
figurational languages such as English or
French, as well as languages such as Russian
where the surface order is mainly determined
by the communicative structure. However,
German is an especially interesting case be-
cause surface order depends strongly on both
the syntactic position (e.g. finite verb in V2 or
Vfinal position) and the communicative
structure (e.g. content of the Vorfeld).
From a computational point of view, we are
interested in the complexity of our formalism.
It is possible to obtain a polynomial parser
provided that we limit the number of nodes
simultaneously involved in non-projective
configurations (see Kahane et al 1998 for
similar techniques). Such limitations seem
reasonable for Germanic languages (e.g. verb
                                                
9
 The quotation marks indicate that the complemen-
tizing part of the relative pronoun is not a real word,
and hence it does not actually occupy the comple-
mentizer field, and must consequently accommodate
another element.
clusters with more than four verbs are un-
usual).

Abstract 
We present a syntactic annotation scheme for 
spoken French that is currently used in the 
Rhapsodie project. This annotation is depend-
ency-based and includes coordination and dis-
fluency as analogously encoded types of para-
digmatic phenomena. Furthermore, we attempt 
a thorough definition of the discourse units re-
quired by the systematic annotation of other 
phenomena beyond usual sentence boundaries, 
which are typical for spoken language. This 
includes so called ?macrosyntactic? phenom-
ena such as dislocation, parataxis, insertions, 
grafts, and epexegesis. 
1 Introduction 
This communication presents the syntactic anno-
tation scheme currently being developed for 
Rhapsodie a project funded by the French Na-
tional Research Agency (ANR) which aims to 
study the syntax-prosody interface in spoken 
French. Rhapsodie aims to elaborate a freely dis-
tributed corpus, classified into different discourse 
genres, and doted with prosodic and syntactic 
annotations elaborated for the study of the rela-
tionship of prosody, syntax, and information 
structure in discourse. 
Contrary to what is available in the anglo-
saxon world, there is no freely distributed and 
syntactically annotated corpus of spoken French 
today. This is what our project aims to provide. 
The only tree-bank for French, that we know 
of, is the Paris 7 Corpus (Abeill? et al 2003). 
This is a corpus of newspaper texts, annotated 
mainly in Penn Tree Bank style and partially 
with dependency annotations, which is distrib-
uted only under highly restrictive conditions. 
Some annotated corpora of spoken French 
nevertheless exist: The CID (Corpus of Interac-
tional Data) (Bertrand et al 2009) uses an anno-
tation with typed chunks, and the VALIBEL cor-
pus (Dister et al 2008 ; Degand et Simon 2009) 
consists of delimiting maximal syntactic units. 
This notion, allowing segmentation of the text, is 
essential for any syntactic annotation, a concept 
we will come back to in section 2. Neither of 
these corpora is distributed freely and none 
comes close to the precision and variety of spo-
ken language corpora existing for other lan-
guages like English or Dutch. 
There is, however, an important tradition of 
description of the spoken French language, nota-
bly at the University of Provence in Aix, where a 
team led by Claire Blanche-Benveniste coined 
the two level distinction of ?micro-syntax? and 
?macro-syntax? and proposed a parallel analysis 
of paradigmatic phenomena ranging from coor-
dinations to disfluencies (Blanche-Benveniste 
1990, Berrendonner 1990, Bilger et al 1997, 
Gu?not 2006, Gerdes & Kahane 2009). 
Rhapsodie?s innovation stems from a formal-
ization and generalization of this tradition. The 
parallel annotation of prosody and syntax natu-
rally leads to a syntactic analysis of the text as a 
whole, including hesitations and disfluencies, 
whereas other approaches tend to erase these 
phenomena in order to obtain standard sentences 
similar to written language where syntactic anno-
tation is well-established. Examples of this latter 
approach include main reference corpora, for 
example the English Switchboard corpus 
(http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/switchboard), or the 
CGN (Dutch Spoken Corpus, 
http://lands.let.ru.nl/cgn). These types of annota-
tion also commonly exclude phenomena such as 
colon effects, grafts, and associated illocutionary 
274
  
units, because of their limited conception of sen-
tence boundaries and a focus on written phenom-
ena. The Rhapsodie syntactic analysis scheme 
tends to include all words of the corpus and finds 
it necessary to take account of all the above phe-
nomena because they are, we believe, intrinsi-
cally syntactic. 
The original English examples in this paper 
stem from the Micase corpus (Simpson-Vlach & 
Leicher 2006), in particular from the segment 
Honors Advising (http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/ 
micase) and from interviews that we collected 
ourselves (ELUI; English Language Use Inter-
views, Duffort in preparation). Some phenomena 
are specific to French and we use original exam-
ples from the Rhapsodie corpus; some other ex-
amples, designated as "constructed examples", 
are simplified constructions of phenomena we 
only encountered in more complex combinations. 
2 Annotation 
In the analysis of written text, the units of anno-
tation are usually taken to be ?graphical? sen-
tences, i.e. the words between two periods, a nei-
ther explicit nor homogenous notion that has lit-
tle or no linguistic relevance. Spoken corpus an-
notation, on the contrary, has to simultaneously 
define dependency units and the dependency an-
notation that we impose on these units. These 
two questions are not independent: The more 
phenomena we include in the syntactic analysis, 
the longer the units will become. 
Our first choice concerns syntactic annotation: 
Functional dependency annotation has proven to 
be a more challenging task than phrase structure 
annotation but seems to be more versatile for 
various languages and more promising as an in-
termediate syntactic structure between the or-
dered words and semantics. All dependency 
based corpora have to choose a set of functions 
to be used in annotation. This choice is often 
guided by practical considerations (existing 
phrase structure annotation, parsers, semantic 
needs, etc.) but even though few have tried to 
give a formal and general definition of syntactic 
functions (Mel'cuk & Pertsov 1987), each choice 
of a set of functions presumes that two elements 
(subtrees) that share the same function have 
something in common: Usually this is thought to 
be 
- the exchangeability of the two elements 
(at a certain degree of abstraction, exclud-
ing, for example, agreement features) 
- the coordinability of the two elements 
For example, to decide whether gone and the 
bike have the same function in he has gone and 
he has a bike, it is not sufficient that the two 
elements can be interchanged; we also need co-
ordinability which in this case is ungrammatical. 
We will therefore stipulate the existence of two 
different functions.1 
(1) *He has gone and a bike. 
In other words, a coordination is an orthogonal 
construction to a head-daughter relation. This 
also shows in the difficulty in dependency as 
well as phrase structure approaches to account 
for coordination. The near-symmetry of coordi-
nations violates basic assumptions of X-bar the-
ory and head-daughter relationships. Contrary to 
other dependency analyses like the Prague De-
pendency Treebank (ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt) or the 
Alpino Dependency Treebank (www.let.rug.nl/ 
vannoord/trees), our approach does not include 
coordinations in our syntactic functions, but 
these, as well as other paradigmatic phenomena, 
are encoded in what we call ?piles?2 (see section 
2.3). 
2.1 Dependency Units and Illocutionary 
Units  
We don?t consider that syntax can be reduced to 
dependency, and we have to define the delimita-
tion of functional relations as well as the delimi-
tation of so called ?macro-syntactic? phenomena 
such as dislocation and colon effect that go be-
yond dependency. Our complete annotation 
therefore includes units joined by dependency, 
paradigmatic sub-units, and higher-level rela-
tions that are still syntactic and not purely discur-
sive. We propose a well defined distinction be-
tween syntax based segmentation, called ?de-
pendency units? (DU), and pragmatically based 
segmentation, called ?illocutionary units? (IU). 
Applying a bottom-up approach, we first look 
for rectional (head-daughter) relations, which 
gives us the DUs: Each DU is a unit, constructed 
around a syntactic head that itself has no gover-
nor. We define a rectional relation using the 
                                                 
1
 Note that this choice is less clear in many cases, 
such as for example for the distinction between pas-
sives and predicative functions, or between full and 
light verbs. 
2
 Of course this can be represented formally equiva-
lently as a specific type of dependency, but we believe 
that the distinction is linguistically important and lim-
iting the notion of dependency to true head-daughter 
relations makes the notion of dependency more con-
sistent. 
275
  
common criteria: i.e. constraints in terms of cat-
egory, morphological features, and restructura-
tion possibilities (commutation with a pronoun, 
diatheses, clefting). 
In addition to these syntactic units, we define 
the IUs as unities that demonstrate a discursive 
autonomy, in other words, that have their own 
illocutionary force. These terms may seem sur-
prising in formal syntax, but we believe that they 
are unavoidable for our task. This definition as-
sents to traditional grammarians? intuition of sen-
tences holding a ?complete meaning? and Creis-
sels? definition of ?sentence? (2004) as a pro-
positional content realizing an enunciation. 
Both units, DUs and IUs are relatively inde-
pendent and complementary and they have their 
own well-formedness conditions. In general, an 
IU is a combination of several DUs, but we will 
show examples ranging from simple interjections 
to complex embedded DUs. In some cases a rec-
tional relation, and thus a DU can go beyond the 
limits of an IU. 
This opposition of DU and IU reflects 
Blanche-Benveniste?s opposition between micro-
syntax and macrosyntax (1990): A DU is the 
maximal microsyntactic unit; an IU constitutes 
the maximal unit of macrosyntax.   
2.2 Microsyntax and Dependency Units  
In this paper, we will not elaborate further on the 
dependency annotation itself. We have followed 
approaches taken by numerous other corpora 
such as the Prague Dependency Treebank or the 
Alpino Dependency Treebank (www.let.rug.nl/ 
vannoord/trees/). 
Let us consider the following utterance, typi-
cal for spoken French: 
(2) moi ma m?re le salon c?est de la moquette 
me my mother the living room it's carpet 
'My mother's living room is carpeted' 
In (2), three elements?moi, literally 'me', ma 
m?re 'my mother', le salon 'the living room'?are 
paratactically juxtaposed to a predicative unit, 
c'est de la moquette 'it is carpet'. These elements 
are not syntactically dependent on any element in 
the predicative unit. We treat them as separate 
DUs. We will illustrate in 2.4 the treatment we 
propose for the relation holding between these 
DUs.  
2.3 Piles  
Beside dependency, we acknowledge the exis-
tence of a separate mechanism of syntactic cohe-
sion within DUs: Following Gerdes & Kahane 
(2009), we call the syntactic relation between 
units occupying the same structural position 
within a DU, or, in other words, holding the 
same position in a dependency tree, a ?pile?. Co-
ordination is a typical case of piling: 
(3) our two languages are {English | ^and 
French} (ELUI) 
We consider that we also have a pile of elements 
occupying the same structural position in refor-
mulations (4), disfluencies (5) or corrections (6): 
(4)  did a humanoid species { spring up | or ex-
ist } in various places {in the world | {not 
just in Africa | ^but also in Asia | ^and 
maybe also in southern Europe }} // (Mi-
case) 
(5)  { I~ | in~ | including } kind of a general idea 
of these "uh" (ELUI) 
(6)  {I | I} have lots of other interests {like "um" | 
that are a little bit more like} {paleontology 
| ^or astronomy | ^or international religion | 
^or "uh" not religion | international relations 
| ^so those things {I wanna & | I think I?m 
gonna concentrate more on} // (Micase) 
Our desire to treat coordinations, reformulations 
and disfluencies as phenomena showing syntac-
tic similarity resides in the fact that, as shown by 
Blanche-Benveniste (1990) among others, it is 
not always easy to distinguish between disflu-
ency, reformulation and coordination: As an ex-
ample, consider (7a), more or less interpreted in 
the same way as examples (7b,c) which are, re-
spectively, a reformulation and a coordination: 
(7) a. she is { a linguist | maybe a technician } 
b. she is { a linguist | "um" a technician } 
c. she is { a linguist | ^or a technician }  
(constructed example) 
In all cases of piles, we use the same notation: 
the segments that occupy the same syntactic po-
sition are put between curly brackets { } and they 
are separated by vertical pipes |. Pipes therefore 
separate what we call pile layers. These layers 
may be introduced by pile markers, usually a 
conjunction. If a pile marker does not play a syn-
tactic role, it is preceded by a caret ^. 
Dependencies and piles allow for a complete 
description of the syntactic cohesion of a DU. In 
(7), for example, the first layer realizes the posi-
tion of attribute within the dependency structure. 
The syntagmatic relation between the two layers 
entails a paradigmatic relation between linguist 
and computational scientist. The second layer 
inherits the structural (attribute) position from 
276
  
the paradigmatic relation within the dependency 
structure. It should also be noticed that, with the 
exception of abandoned layers (noted &), layers 
can be seen as alternatives. It is possible to walk 
these structures by choosing one layer of each 
pile, extracting as many utterances as there are 
paths. Each of these utterances has a complete 
dependency structure merely containing govern-
ment and modification relations, for example, 
(7a) can be reduced to the two DUs in (8), which 
will constitute the input for the parsing process: 
(8)  a. she is a linguist 
  b. she is maybe a computational linguist  
Note that maybe, though it acts as a pile marker, 
also plays a syntactic role in the context of the 
pile, contrarily to a conjunction (*she is or a 
computational scientist), the latter being marked 
with the caret to make this distinction. 
2.4 Macrosyntax and Illocutionary Units  
An Illocutionary Unit (IU) is any portion of 
discourse encoding a unique illocutionary act: 
assertions, questions, and commands (see Ben-
veniste 1966, Searle 1976). An IU expresses a 
speech act that can be made explicit by introduc-
ing an implicit performative act such as "I say", 
"I ask", "I order". A test for detecting the Illocu-
tionary Units that make up a discourse consists 
of the introduction of such performative seg-
ments (see below). A segmentation in IUs is par-
ticularly important for the study of the connec-
tion of prosody and syntax, which is the goal of 
Rhapsodie, because these units are prosodically 
marked (Blanche-Benveniste 1997, Cresti 2000). 
We use the symbol // to segment the text in IUs 
(but see also the symbols //+ in section 3). 
It should be noted that there exist IUs that are 
not made up of Verbal Dependency Units. See 
examples (9a,b): 
(9) a. SPK1: we've heard all of the "you know" 
big "uh" meteors coming from outer space 
//     SPK2: right // (Micase) 
      b. ^and then < boom //  
      (constructed example) 
We extend the notion of IU to a unit whose status 
in terms of illocutionary acts, let alne in terms 
of propositional structures, may be unclear, but 
which can form a "complete message": interjec-
tions, phatics, feed back particles like voil? 
?that?s it?, quoi ?what?, h?las!, ?alas?, tant pis! 
?oh well?. See for instance in the famous critical 
punt against French writer Corneille (10a) that 
could be annotated as in (10b). 
(10) a. Apr?s l'Ag?silas, h?las ! Apr?s l'Attila, 
hol? ! (Nicolas Boileau 1828) 
'After Ag?silas, alas! After Attila, no 
more!' 
 b. apr?s l'Ag?silas < h?las // apr?s l'Attila < 
hol? // 
In a context such as (11), a single IU is made up 
of two verbal DUs: I got up in the morning and I 
was with clients. 
(11) I got up in the morning < I was with clients 
// I ate at noon < I was with clients // I went 
to bed at night < I was with clients //  
(translation, Rhapsodie) 
The relation between the two verbal DUs in (11) 
cannot be described in terms of microsyntactic 
dependency. Indeed, I got up in the morning is 
not dependent on the verbal construction of the 
following DU. Nevertheless, the existence of a 
macrosyntactic relation can be acknowledged. 
The first DU in (11), I got up in the morning, is 
not as autonomous from an illocutionary point of 
view: it cannot constitute a self standing mes-
sage. In (11) it is not asserted that "I got up in the 
morning". And (11) can be paraphrased by (12a) 
but not by (12b): 
(12) a. it is said that I got up in the morning I was 
with the clients 
    b. # it is said that I got up in the morning 
and that I was with the clients. 
The illocutionary force of (11) is encoded by the 
DU I was with clients, which can be interpreted 
as an assertion even if uttered in isolation. Whe-
reas the unit I got up in the morning does not 
have in this context any illocutionary interpreta-
tion. The subsegment of an IU supporting the 
illocutionary force of the IU is called the nu-
cleus. It can be autonomized. The nucleus and 
the others segments forming the IU are called the 
Illocutionary Components (ICs). The ICs are al-
ways microsyntactic units and are generally 
DUs. The nucleus is the unit that is affected by a 
negation or an interrogation having scope on the 
IU. See for example the tests in (13) and (14): 
(13) A: I got up in the morning I was with clients 
B: this is not true (? It is not true that you 
were with clients, # It is not true that you 
got up in the morning) 
(14) A: I got up in the morning I was with clients 
B: Is that true? (? Is that true that you were 
with clients) 
(# Is that true that you got up in the morn-
ing) 
277
  
ICs preceding and following the nucleus are 
called pre-nuclear units (Pre-N) and post-nuclear 
units (Post-N). We use the symbol < to mark the 
Pre-N and the > to mark the post-N. These tags 
can be considered as explicit counterparts of 
commas in writing. 
(15) il y a plein de trucs < tu les vois apr?s > en 
fait > les d?fauts (Rhapsodie)  
there are plenty of things < you see them 
later > actually > the faults  
It is possible that, due to a particular communica-
tive structure, the illocutionary force is carried 
only by a part of a DU and that the nucleus forms 
a DU with another IC: 
(16) to my mother <+ I don't speak anymore 
(constructed example) 
(17) two euros >+ it costs  
(translation, Blanche-Benveniste 1990) 
The addition of the symbol + indicates that the 
IC on one and the other side are parts of the same 
UR. 
3 More cases of irregularity in the inter-
face between microsyntactic and mac-
rosyntactic units 
We will now present a number of structures that 
were particularly problematic for the syntactic 
annotation of the Rhapsodie corpus and that il-
lustrate the mismatch between DU and IU 
boundaries well. 
3.1 DU beyond the IU 
Up to now, we have seen a few examples of 
segmentation of an IU into DUs. We will now 
show that there are cases, traditionally named 
epexegesis, where we can consider that it is in 
fact the DU which is segmented into multiple IU. 
Let us consider these two examples: 
(18)  SPK1: he has arrived 
    SPK2: last night (constructed example) 
(19) She speaks French. And very well!  
(constructed example) 
In these two examples, there are two illocu-
tionary acts: in (18) this is evident as there are 
two speakers uttering two different assertions. In 
(19), there are two assertions. In both cases, the 
second illocutionary act is not (micro) syntacti-
cally autonomous. The second IU directly fol-
lows the first IU and integrates and completes its 
syntactic structure, being in a dependency rela-
tion with the head of the first IU (the verb ar-
rived in (18), the verb speaks in (19)). We can 
therefore paraphrase the preceding examples 
thusly: 
(20)  SPK1: he has arrived 
    SPK2: he has arrived last night 
(21) She speaks French and (what is more) she 
speaks French very well. 
Rather than postulating an ellipsis in the second 
segment (as suggested by Culicover & Jackend-
off 2005, among others) we analyze the two IUs 
as belonging to the same DU. This choice natu-
rally descends from the modular approach we 
adopted, which distinguishes between illocution-
ary and syntactic relations. As in the case of a 
dependency relation crossing the IC border, we 
add a + symbol to indicate that the illocutionary 
frontier is not a limit to the DU. 
In addition to dependency, piling can also 
cross IU frontiers, as in (22):  
(22)   SPK1: How often do you go {there |} //+ 
     SPK2: {| to the States} // (ELUI) 
In (22) the argument position of the verb go is 
realized twice: through the segment there uttered 
by the first speaker and through the segment to 
the states uttered as a separate IU by the second 
speaker. We use the notation {X|}?{|Y} when 
the pile between X and Y is interrupted by a syn-
tactic frontier, in this case an IU frontier, or a 
discontinuity. 
It should be noted that the piling in (22) does 
not only cross an IU frontier but it crosses a 
speech turn frontier as well, as it is realized by 
two different speakers. We do not consider the 
speech turn as a limit for the extension of syntac-
tic phenomena, rather we assume that there can 
be co-construction of semantic content and syn-
tactic structures in dialogues 
3.2 Inserted IUs 
An IU can be inserted into another IU. This is 
what happens for example in the case of inser-
tions.  
(23) a. I woke up (you're going to laugh //) in the 
morning at five o'clock // (constructed ex-
ample) 
b. { I studied | (sorry//) I studied in college | 
I studied } international relations // (ELUI) 
We propose two equivalent ways to note this, 
either by placing the inserted utterance between 
parentheses as in (23) or by using the symbol # 
to indicate that the utterance is continued later at 
the following occurrence of #: 
278
  
(24) a. I woke up #// you're going to laugh //# in 
the morning at five o'clock //  
(constructed example) 
These two notations are strict equivalents __"(" = 
"#//" and ")" = "//#"__, but the symbol # also al-
lows the encoding of more complex cases such 
as the following example, where SPK1 is inter-
rupted three times by SPK2. This does not keep 
SPK1 from pursuing a relatively complex utter-
ance, all the while interacting with SPK2 through 
yeahs which punctuate SPK2's interventions. The 
sequence of //#+ tags indicates that the IU is 
completed (//), but that the DU continues later on 
(#+): 
(25) SPK1: but but otherwise uh well & // in any 
case the fundamental research it it remains 
free //#+ 
SPK2: yeah yeah // 
SPK1: #luckily //#+ 
SPK2 so yeah // in 2009 // 
SPK1: yeah // 
SPK2 : we'll have to see later // 
SPK1: yeah // # the applied research < less 
// ^but the fundamental research < yeah // 
(translation, Rhapsodie) 
3.3 Embedded IUs 
Direct discourse presents a particular difficulty 
due to the embedding of illocutionary acts. Con-
sider the following example: 
(26)  he said [ go away > poor fool // ] //  
(translation, radio) 
The reported speech in (26), annotated with the 
symbols [ ], has its own illocutionary force, it 
can be regarded therefore as an autonomous IU. 
Regardless, the preceding segment (he said) does 
not form an autonomous illocutionary act or a 
complete DU. We treat such a structure as an 
embedded IU. The reported speech is an IU em-
bedded in the IU made up of the whole utterance 
he said go away poor fool. 
Another phenomenon that we treat as the em-
bedding of IUs is the graft. We define a graft as 
the filling of a syntactic position with a segment 
belonging to an unexpected category (Deulofeu, 
1999). 
(27) a. you don't have an agenda with [one day I 
do this // one day I do that //] (translation, 
Deulofeu 1999) 
b. you follow the tram line which passes 
towards the [I think it's an old firehouse //] 
// (translation, Rhapsodie) 
c. I could like take and see {if I & | if it was 
worth it that I should go into "you know" 
more depth | ^or if that was just sort of like 
[ okay {I l- | I like it} // ^but I don't wanna 
like study that // ^so I don't know //] } // 
(Micase) 
d. we had criticized the newspaper [I think it 
was the Provencal #] we had criticized it 
in relation to (# or the Meridional //) in re-
lation to the death of [what was his name // 
not Coluche // the other guy //] //  
  (translation, Blanche-Benveniste 1990) 
This phenomenon can be regarded as a rupture of 
sub-categorization. The grafted segment usually 
has its own illocutionary force, being in most 
cases a unit commenting on the lexical choice 
that should have been done to respect the sub-
categorization. In a graft, as well as in reported 
speech, an IU occupies a governed position in-
side a DU. 
3.4 Associated IUs 
A number of  discourse particles (such as "right", 
"of course" in English, "quoi", "bon" in French) 
and parentheticals units (such as "I think", "I 
guess", "you know" in English, "je crois", "tu 
vois" in French) are endowed with an illocution-
ary force. However, these elements do not serve 
the purpose of modifying the common ground 
between speakers. They merely have a function 
of modal modification or interactional regulation. 
We call these units "associated units", we treat 
them as non autonomous illocutionary compo-
nents and we annotate them between quotation 
marks " ". 
(28) it's a really "you know" open field "you 
know" like all that stuff // (Micase) 
(29) he is coming "I guess" // (constructed) 
(30) "I mean" English wasn't that helpful itself // 
(ELUI) 
4  Levels of annotation 
Our annotation strategy rests on the fact that 
relatively good tools for automatic analysis of 
French written texts are currently in existence 
(Bourigault et al 2005, De la Clergerie 2005, 
Boulier & Sagot 2005). Adapting these tools to 
spoken French would constitute a project in and 
of itself, one much more ambitious than our an-
notation project (even though we believe that 
Rhapsodie is an essential step towards the devel-
opment of parsers for spoken language, and that 
one of the final uses of Rhapsodie will be as a 
279
  
contribution to the training and development of 
these parsers). In other words, we want to use 
these tools developed for written text without 
modifying them substantially. In order to do this, 
we realize a pre-treatment of transcribed text "by 
hand": We manually annotate every phenomenon 
typical of the syntax of speech. The result is a 
pre-treated text that parsers can analyze as writ-
ten text with minimal error. The segmentation 
into IUs and DUs described in the previous sec-
tions aims at providing such a pre-treatment. As 
we hope we have shown, our pre-treatment has a 
theoretical and practical value, and could consti-
tute a satisfying analysis of speech on its own. 
Regardless, we would like to present all levels of 
our treatment, as this will allow a greater under-
standing of the choices that have been made (for 
example the analysis of piles during pre-
treatment). 
Our annotation procedure is organized into 
several steps which alternate regularly between 
automatic and manual treatment. 
Level 1: Raw transcription (i.e. without syntactic 
enrichment) - This consists of orthographic tran-
scription which includes speech overlap, trun-
cated morphemes, etc. 
Level 2: Simple automatic pre-treatment - Anno-
tation of trivial "disfluencies" (such as word re-
petition) and identification of potential associ-
ated IUs (um, uh... but also like, you know...). 
This automatic step is very rough and is to be 
corrected at level 3. 
Level 3: Manual syntactic segmentation - This is 
the annotation presented in the previous sections 
of this paper, indicating DUs, IUs, ICs, piles, etc. 
This level is obtained manually starting at level 
2. The general idea is that it simultaneously con-
stitutes: 
- A coding of everything that we know we 
are not able to automatically calculate, 
and which would cause problems for 
parsers (originally programmed for writ-
ten text), 
- A coding which is satisfactory in itself 
and permits a preliminary study of the 
syntax-prosody interface. 
A tool has been developed for checking the well-
formedness of this level of annotation.  
Level 4: Parser entry - Existing parsers for 
French have not been programmed to process 
simple transcriptions of speech, nor have they 
been tuned to treat the markup that we have in-
troduced at level 3. However, these tags allow us 
to automatically segment the text and furnish the 
parser with sections it is capable of analyzing. 
The following example will illustrate this point. 
(31)  are you thinking {of other communicat~ | 
"uh" of other functions}  
  (constructed example) 
would give us to two segments: 
(32) a. are you thinking of other communicat~ 
        b. are you thinking of other functions. 
Certain fragments of text are therefore duplicated 
and analyzed multiple times. These analyses, if 
identical, are automatically fused in the ulterior 
levels. If they differ, a manual treatment is nec-
essary. Another strategy consists of not unpiling 
but rather perceiving an utterance including a 
pile as a Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG), that is 
to say a graph in which the arcs are labeled by 
words of the text, and which integrate all possi-
ble paths in a pile structure. A parser like SxLFG 
(Boulier and Sagot 2005) can manage a DAG 
entry, but for the moment it is parameterized to 
choose the best path in the DAG and not to ana-
lyze the entire DAG. 
Level 5: Parser output - Parsers provide us with a 
syntactic analysis in the form of a dependency 
tree. We now have two things left to do: 1) au-
tomatically translate these analyses so that they 
correspond exactly to the desired labels (this is 
mainly a renaming process of functional labels); 
2) apply syntactic annotations computed for the 
unfolded segments to the original texts (those 
from level 3), while fusing duplicated syntactic 
annotations. 
Level 6: Dependency analysis - This consists of 
level 5 after automatic reinsertion of analyzed 
sections and manual correction. The last level is 
a manual correction of level 5, this is absolutely 
necessary as the parsers still make many mis-
takes (we estimate that about 30% of dependen-
cies will have to be corrected) and do not use our 
same labels. The encoding of level 6 is therefore 
a complete syntactic analysis of text, which in-
cludes microsyntax (functional dependencies) as 
well as macrosyntax. 
Conclusion 
The ongoing process of annotating transcriptions 
of spoken French with syntactic functions has 
revealed the necessity of a well-defined text seg-
mentation separated into illocutionary and de-
pendency units. This process is an interesting 
challenge in its own right as it allows, for the 
time being, only very limited automated steps, 
280
  
and can be seen as a necessary pre-treatment be-
fore the parsing process, relying mainly on tools 
tuned to work on written data. Linguistically, 
contrary to the conventional ad-hoc punctuation 
of written text, our segmentation can be seen as a 
systematic punctuation process relying on repro-
ducible criteria allowing for a distribution of this 
process to trained annotators. Moreover, the no-
tion of paradigmatic piles naturally completes the 
short-comings of head-descriptions in coordina-
tions and other paradigmatic phenomena. 
If we want to share tools and resources across 
languages and theoretical models, it is necessary 
that annotation norms develop in the field of syn-
tactic annotation of spoken texts, in other words, 
we need some kind of language-independent 
punctuation scheme reflecting syntactic and 
pragmatic segmentation of the text. This is a 
process that is well on its way for written text. 
Our work on French and English shows that our 
annotation scheme proposes criteria that can be 
applied to different languages while yielding in-
teresting results. We hope this to be a contribu-
tion to the development of unified annotation 
methods in dependency annotation of spoken text 
and thus to a deeper understanding of functional 
syntax as a whole.
