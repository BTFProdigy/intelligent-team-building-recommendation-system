Abstract
This paper presents the machine trans-
lation systems submitted by the Abu-
MaTran project to the WMT 2014 trans-
lation task. The language pair concerned
is English?French with a focus on French
as the target language. The French to En-
glish translation direction is also consid-
ered, based on the word alignment com-
puted in the other direction. Large lan-
guage and translation models are built us-
ing all the datasets provided by the shared
task organisers, as well as the monolin-
gual data from LDC. To build the trans-
lation models, we apply a two-step data
selection method based on bilingual cross-
entropy difference and vocabulary satura-
tion, considering each parallel corpus in-
dividually. Synthetic translation rules are
extracted from the development sets and
used to train another translation model.
We then interpolate the translation mod-
els, minimising the perplexity on the de-
velopment sets, to obtain our final SMT
system. Our submission for the English to
French translation task was ranked second
amongst nine teams and a total of twenty
submissions.
1 Introduction
This paper presents the systems submitted by the
Abu-MaTran project (runs named DCU-Prompsit-
UA) to the WMT 2014 translation task for the
English?French language pair. Phrase-based sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) systems were
submitted, considering the two translation direc-
tions, with the focus on the English to French di-
rection. Language models (LMs) and translation
models (TMs) are trained using all the data pro-
vided by the shared task organisers, as well as
the Gigaword monolingual corpora distributed by
LDC.
To train the LMs, monolingual corpora and the
target side of the parallel corpora are first used
individually to train models. Then the individ-
ual models are interpolated according to perplex-
ity minimisation on the development sets.
To train the TMs, first a baseline is built us-
ing the News Commentary parallel corpus. Sec-
ond, each remaining parallel corpus is processed
individually using bilingual cross-entropy differ-
ence (Axelrod et al., 2011) in order to sepa-
rate pseudo in-domain and out-of-domain sen-
tence pairs, and filtering the pseudo out-of-
domain instances with the vocabulary saturation
approach (Lewis and Eetemadi, 2013). Third,
synthetic translation rules are automatically ex-
tracted from the development set and used to train
another translation model following a novel ap-
proach (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2014). Finally,
we interpolate the four translation models (base-
line, in-domain, filtered out-of-domain and rules)
by minimising the perplexity obtained on the de-
velopment sets and investigate the best tuning and
decoding parameters.
The reminder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: the datasets and tools used in our experi-
ments are described in Section 2. Then, details
about the LMs and TMs are given in Section 3 and
Section 4 respectively. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of the final SMT system according to
different tuning and decoding parameters in Sec-
tion 5 before presenting conclusions in Section 6.

2 Datasets and Tools
We use all the monolingual and parallel datasets
in English and French provided by the shared task
organisers, as well as the LDC Gigaword for the
same languages
1
. For each language, a true-case
model is trained using all the data, using the train-
truecaser.perl script included in the MOSES tool-
kit (Koehn et al., 2007).
Punctuation marks of all the monolingual and
parallel corpora are then normalised using the
script normalize-punctuation.perl provided by the
organisers, before being tokenised and true-cased
using the scripts distributed with the MOSES tool-
kit. The same pre-processing steps are applied to
the development and test sets. As development
sets, we used all the test sets from previous years
of WMT, from 2008 to 2013 (newstest2008-2013).
Finally, the training parallel corpora are cleaned
using the script clean-corpus-n.perl, keeping the
sentences longer than 1 word, shorter than 80
words, and with a length ratio between sentence
pairs lower than 4.

The statistics about the cor-
pora used in our experiments after pre-processing
are presented in Table 1.
For training LMs we use KENLM (Heafield et
al., 2013) and the SRILM tool-kit (Stolcke et al.,
2011). For training TMs, we use MOSES (Koehn
et al., 2007) version 2.1 with MGIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003; Gao and Vogel, 2008). These tools are
used with default parameters for our experiments
except when explicitly said.
The decoder used to generate translations is
MOSES using features weights optimised with
MERT (Och, 2003). As our approach relies on
training individual TMs, one for each parallel cor-
pus, our final TM is obtained by linearly interpo-
lating the individual ones. The interpolation of
TMs is performed using the script tmcombine.py,
minimising the cross-entropy between the TM
and the concatenated development sets from 2008
to 2012 (noted newstest2008-2012), as described
in Sennrich (2012). Finally, we make use of the
findings from WMT 2013 brought by the win-
ning team (Durrani et al., 2013) and decide to use
the Operation Sequence Model (OSM), based on
minimal translation units and Markov chains over
sequences of operations, implemented in MOSES

3 Language Models
The LMs are trained in the same way for both
languages. First, each monolingual and parallel
corpus is considered individually (except the par-
allel version of Europarl and News Commentary)
and used to train a 5-gram LM with the modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing method. We then interpo-
late the individual LMs using the script compute-
best-mix available with the SRILM tool-kit (Stol-
cke et al., 2011), based on their perplexity scores
on the concatenation of the development sets from
2008 to 2012 (the 2013 version is held-out for the
tuning of the TMs).
172
The final LM for French contains all the word
sequences from 1 to 5-grams contained in the
training corpora without any pruning. However,
with the computing resources at our disposal, the
English LMs could not be interpolated without
pruning non-frequent n-grams. Thus, n-grams
with n ? [3; 5] with a frequency lower than 2 were
removed. Details about the final LMs are given in
Table 2.

4 Translation Models
In this Section, we describe the TMs trained for
the shared task. First, we present the two-step data
selection process which aims to (i) separate in and
out-of-domain parallel sentences and (ii) reduce
the total amount of out-of-domain data. Second,
a novel approach for the automatic extraction of
translation rules and their use to enrich the phrase
table is detailed.
4.1 Parallel Data Filtering and Vocabulary
Saturation
Amongst the parallel corpora provided by the
shared task organisers, only News Commentary
can be considered as in-domain regarding the de-
velopment and test sets. We use this training
corpus to build our baseline SMT system. The
other parallel corpora are individually filtered us-
ing bilingual cross-entropy difference (Moore and
Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011). This data
filtering method relies on four LMs, two in the
source and two in the target language, which
aim to model particular features of in and out-of-
domain sentences.
We build the in-domain LMs using the source
and target sides of the News Commentary paral-
lel corpus. Out-of-domain LMs are trained on a
vocabulary-constrained subset of each remaining
parallel corpus individually using the SRILM tool-
kit, which leads to eight models (four in the source
language and four in the target language).
3
3
The subsets contain the same number of sentences and
the same vocabulary as News Commentary.
Then, for each out-of-domain parallel corpus,
we compute the bilingual cross-entropy difference
of each sentence pair as:
[H
in
(S
src
)?H
out
(S
src
)] + [H
in
(S
trg
)?H
out
(S
trg
)] (1)
where S
src
and S
trg
are the source and the tar-
get sides of a sentence pair, H
in
and H
out
are
the cross-entropies of the in and out-of-domain
LMs given a sentence pair. The sentence pairs are
then ranked and the lowest-scoring ones are taken
to train the pseudo in-domain TMs. However,
the cross-entropy difference threshold required to
split a corpus in two parts (pseudo in and out-of-
domain) is usually set empirically by testing sev-
eral subset sizes of the top-ranked sentence pairs.
This method is costly in our setup as it would lead
to training and evaluating multiple SMT systems
for each of the pseudo in-domain parallel corpora.
In order to save time and computing power,
we consider only pseudo in-domain sentence pairs
those with a bilingual cross-entropy difference be-
low 0, i.e. those deemed more similar to the
in-domain LMs than to the out-of-domain LMs
(H
in
< H
out
). A sample of the distribution of
scores for the out-of-domain corpora is shown in
Figure 1. The resulting pseudo in-domain corpora
are used to train individual TMs, as detailed in Ta-
ble 3.

The results obtained using the pseudo in-
domain data show BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)
scores superior or equal to the baseline score.
Only the Europarl subset is slightly lower than
the baseline, while the subset taken from the 10
9
corpus reaches the highest BLEU compared to the
other systems (30.29). This is mainly due to the
173
size of this subset which is ten times larger than
the one taken from Europarl. The last row of Ta-
ble 3 shows the BLEU score obtained after interpo-
lating the four pseudo in-domain translation mod-
els. This system outperforms the best pseudo in-
domain one by 0.5 absolute points.

stest2013 for the pseudo in-domain corpora ob-
tained by filtering the out-of-domain corpora with
bilingual cross-entropy difference. The interpola-
tion of pseudo in-domain models is evaluated in
the last row.
After evaluating the pseudo in-domain parallel
data, the remaining sentence pairs for each cor-
pora are considered out-of-domain according to
our filtering approach. However, they may still
contain useful information, thus we make use of
these corpora by building individual TMs for each
corpus (in a similar way we built the pseudo in-
domain models). The total amount of remaining
data (more than 33 million sentence pairs) makes
the training process costly in terms of time and
computing power. In order to reduce these costs,
sentence pairs with a bilingual cross-entropy dif-
ference higher than 10 were filtered out, as we no-
ticed that most of the sentences above this thresh-
old contain noise (non-alphanumeric characters,
foreign languages, etc.).
We also limit the size of the remaining data by
applying the vocabulary saturation method (Lewis
and Eetemadi, 2013). For the out-of-domain sub-
set of each corpus, we traverse the sentence pairs
in the order they are ranked by perplexity differ-
ence and filter out those sentence pairs for which
we have seen already each 1-gram at least 10
times. Each out-of-domain subset from each par-
allel corpus is then used to train a TM before inter-
polating them to create the pseudo out-of-domain
TM. The results reported by MERT obtained on
the newstest2013 development set are detailed in
Table 4.

domain subsets, the reported BLEU scores are
higher than the baseline for the four individual
SMT systems and the interpolated one. This latter
system outperforms the baseline by 3.61 absolute
points. Compared to the results obtained with the
pseudo in-domain data, we observe a slight im-
provement of the BLEU scores using the pseudo
out-of-domain data. However, despite the com-
paratively larger sizes of the latter datasets, the
BLEU scores reached are not that higher. For in-
stance with the 10
9
corpus, the pseudo in and out-
of-domain subsets contain 1.4 and 5.1 million sen-
tence pairs respectively, and the two systems reach
30.3 and 30.5 BLEU. These scores indicate that
the pseudo in-domain SMT systems are more ef-
ficient on the English?French newstest2013 devel-
opment set.
4.2 Extraction of Translation Rules
A synthetic phrase-table based on shallow-transfer
MT rules and dictionaries is built as follows. First,
a set of shallow-transfer rules is inferred from the
concatenation of the newstest2008-2012 develop-
ment corpora exactly in the same way as in the
UA-Prompsit submission to this translation shared
task (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2014). In sum-
mary, rules are obtained from a set of bilingual
phrases extracted from the parallel corpus after
its morphological analysis and part-of-speech dis-
ambiguation with the tools in the Apertium rule-
based MT platform (Forcada et al., 2011).
The extraction algorithm commonly used in
phrase-based SMT is followed with some added
heuristics which ensure that the bilingual phrases
174
extracted are compatible with the bilingual dic-
tionary. Then, many different rules are generated
from each bilingual phrase; each of them encodes
a different degree of generalisation over the partic-
ular example it has been extracted from. Finally,
the minimum set of rules which correctly repro-
duces all the bilingual phrases is found based on
integer linear programming search (Garfinkel and
Nemhauser, 1972).
Once the rules have been inferred, the phrase
table is built from them and the original rule-
based MT dictionaries, following the method
by S?anchez-Cartagena et al. (2011), which was
one of winning systems
4
(together with two on-
line SMT systems) in the pairwise manual evalu-
ation of the WMT11 English?Spanish translation
task (Callison-Burch et al., 2011). This phrase-
table is then interpolated with the baseline TM and
the results are presented in Table 5. A slight im-
provement over the baseline is observed, which
motivates the use of synthetic rules in our final MT
system. This small improvement may be related
to the small coverage of the Apertium dictionar-
ies: the English?French bilingual dictionary has a
low number of entries compared to more mature
language pairs in Apertium which have around 20
times more bilingual entries.

5 Tuning and Decoding
We present in this Section a short selection of our
experiments, amongst 15+ different configura-
tions, conducted on the interpolation of TMs, tun-
ing and decoding parameters. We first interpolate
the four TMs: the baseline, the pseudo in and out-
of-domain, and the translation rules, minimising
the perplexity obtained on the concatenated de-
velopment sets from 2008 to 2012 (newstest2008-
2012). We investigate the use of OSM trained on
pseudo in-domain data only or using all the paral-
lel data available. Finally, we make variations of

ter using the sign test at p ? 0.1.
the number of n-bests used by MERT.
Results obtained on the development set new-
stest2013 are reported in Table 6. These scores
show that adding OSM to the interpolated trans-
lation models slightly degrades BLEU. However,
by increasing the number of n-bests considered by
MERT to 200-bests, the SMT system with OSM
outperforms the systems evaluated previously in
our experiments. Adding the synthetic translation
rules degrades BLEU (as indicated by the last row
in the Table), thus we decide to submit two sys-
tems to the shared task: one without and one with
synthetic rules. By submitting a system without
synthetic rules, we also ensure that our SMT sys-
tem is constrained according to the shared task
guidelines.

Table 6: BLEU scores reported by MERT on

As MERT is not suitable when a large number
of features are used (our system uses 19 fetures),
we switch to the Margin Infused Relaxed Algo-
rithm (MIRA) for our submitted systems (Watan-
abe et al., 2007). The development set used is
newstest2012, as we aim to select the best decod-
ing parameters according to the scores obtained
when decoding the newstest2013 corpus, after de-
truecasing and de-tokenising using the scripts dis-
tributed with MOSES. This setup allowed us to
compare our results with the participants of the
translation shared task last year. We pick the de-
coding parameters leading to the best results in
terms of BLEU and decode the official test set of
WMT14 newstest2014. The results are reported in
Table 7. Results on newstest2013 show that the de-
coding parameters investigation leads to an over-
all improvement of 0.1 BLEU absolute. The re-
sults on newstest2014 show that adding synthetic
rules did not help improving BLEU and degraded
slightly TER (Snover et al., 2006) scores.
In addition to our English?French submission,
we submitted a French?English translation. Our
French?English MT system is built on the align-
ments obtained from the English?French direc-
tion. The training processes between the two sys-

which are not extracted for the French?English

this latter translation direction are the best ones
obtained in our previous experiments on this
shared task. The case-sensitive scores obtained
for French?English on newstest2014 are 35.0
BLEU13A and 53.1 TER, which ranks us at the
fifth position for this translation direction.
6 Conclusion
We have presented the MT systems developed by
the Abu-MaTran project for the WMT14 trans-
lation shared task. We focused on the French?
English language pair and particularly on the
English?French direction. We have used a two-
step data selection process based on bilingual
cross-entropy difference and vocabulary satura-
tion, as well as a novel approach for the extraction
of synthetic translation rules and their use to en-
rich the phrase table. For the LMs and the TMs,
we rely on training individual models per corpus
before interpolating them by minimising perplex-
ity according to the development set. Finally, we
made use of the findings of WMT13 by including
an OSM model.
Our English?French translation system was
ranked second amongst nine teams and a total of
twenty submissions, while our French?English
submission was ranked fifth. As future work,
we plan to investigate the effect of adding to the
phrase table synthetic translation rules based on
larger dictionaries. We also would like to study the
link between OSM and the different decoding pa-
rameters implemented in MOSES, as we observed
inconsistent results in our experiments.

Abstract
This paper describes the system jointly de-
veloped by members of the Departament
de Llenguatges i Sistemes Inform`atics
at Universitat d?Alacant and the Promp-
sit Language Engineering company for
the shared translation task of the 2014
Workshop on Statistical Machine Trans-
lation. We present a phrase-based sta-
tistical machine translation system whose
phrase table is enriched with information
obtained from dictionaries and shallow-
transfer rules like those used in rule-based
machine translation. The novelty of our
approach lies in the fact that the transfer
rules used were not written by humans, but
automatically inferred from a parallel cor-
pus.
1 Introduction
This paper describes the system jointly submitted
by the Departament de Llenguatges i Sistemes In-
form`atics at Universitat d?Alacant and the Promp-
sit Language Engineering company to the shared
translation task of the ACL 2014 Ninth Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2014).
We participated in the English?French translation
task with a hybrid system that combines, in a
phrase-based statistical machine translation (PB-
SMT) system, bilingual phrases obtained from par-
allel corpora in the usual way (Koehn, 2010, ch.
5), and also bilingual phrases obtained from the
existing dictionaries in the Apertium rule-based
machine translation (RBMT) platform (Forcada et
al., 2011) and a number of shallow-transfer ma-
chine translation rules automatically inferred from
a small subset of the training corpus.
Among the different approaches for adding lin-
guistic information to SMT systems (Costa-Juss`a
and Farr?us, 2014), we followed the path we started
with our submission to the Spanish?English WMT
2011 shared translation task (S?anchez-Cartagena
et al., 2011b) which consisted of enriching the
phrase table of a PBSMT system with phrase pairs
generated using the dictionaries and rules in the
Apertium (Forcada et al., 2011) Spanish?English
RBMT system; our approach was one of the win-
ners
1
(together with two online SMT systems that
were not submitted for the task but were included
in the evaluation by the organisers and a system by
Systran) in the pairwise manual evaluation of the
English?Spanish translation task (Callison-Burch
et al., 2011). In this submission, however, we
only borrow the dictionaries from the Apertium
English?French RBMT system and use them to au-
tomatically infer the rules from a parallel corpus.
We therefore avoid the need for human-written
rules, which are usually written by trained experts,
and explore a novel way to add morphological
information to PBSMT. The rules inferred from
corpora and used to enlarge the phrase table are
shallow-transfer rules that build their output with
the help of the bilingual dictionary and work on
flat intermediate representations (see section 3.1);
no syntactic parsing is consequently required.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows.
The following section outlines related hybrid ap-
proaches. Section 3 formally defines the RBMT
paradigm and summarises the method followed
to automatically infer the shallow-transfer rules,
whereas the enrichment of the phrase table is de-
scribed in section 4. Sections 5 and 6 describe, re-
spectively, the resources we used to build our sub-
mission and the results achieved for the English?
French language pair. The paper ends with some
concluding remarks.
2 Related work
Linguistic data from RBMT systems have already
been used to enrich SMT systems (Tyers, 2009;
Schwenk et al., 2009; Eisele et al., 2008; S?anchez-
Cartagena et al., 2011a). We have already proved
1
No other system was found statistically significantly bet-
ter using the sign test at p ? 0.10.
178
that using hand-written rules and dictionaries from
RBMT yields better results than using only dictio-
naries (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2011a).
However, in the approach we present in this pa-
per, rules are automatically inferred from a paral-
lel corpus after converting it into the intermedi-
ate representation used by the Apertium RBMT
platform (see section 3.3). It can be therefore
seen as a novel method to add morphological in-
formation to SMT, as factored translation models
do (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Graham and van
Genabith, 2010). Unlike factored models, we do
not estimate independent statistical models for the
translation of the different factors (lemmas, lexi-
cal categories, morphological inflection attributes,
etc.) and for the generation of the final surface
forms. Instead, we first infer a set of rules that deal
with the grammatical divergences between the lan-
guages involved by performing operations such as
reorderings, gender and number agreements, etc.
Afterwards, we add synthetic phrase pairs gener-
ated from these rules and the Apertium dictionar-
ies to the data from which the well-known, classi-
cal PBSMT models (Koehn, 2010) are estimated.
The rules in our approach operate on the source-
language (SL) morphological attributes of the in-
put words and on the target-language (TL) mor-
phological attributes of their translation according
to a bilingual dictionary. In addition, they do no
contain probabilities or scores, thus they increase
the predictability of the output and can be easily
corrected by humans. This fact also represents a
significant difference with the probabilistic rules
used by certain approaches that aim at improving
the grammaticality of the SMT output (Riezler and
Maxwell III, 2006; Bojar and Haji?c, 2008).
With respect to the rule inference approach,
other approaches such as those by S?anchez-
Mart??nez and Forcada (2009) and Caseli et al.
(2006) can be found in literature; however, our ap-
proach is the first strategy for shallow-transfer rule
inference which generalises to unseen combina-
tions of morphological inflection attributes in the
training corpus (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2014).
3 Inferring shallow-transfer rules from
parallel corpora
3.1 Shallow-transfer rule-based machine
translation
The RBMT process can be split into three different
steps (Hutchins and Somers, 1992): (i) analysis of
the SL text to build an SL intermediate represen-
tation; (ii) transfer from that SL intermediate rep-
resentation into a TL intermediate representation;
and (iii) generation of the final translation from the
TL intermediate representation.
Shallow-transfer RBMT systems use relatively
simple intermediate representations, which are
based on lexical forms consisting of lemma, part
of speech and morphological inflection informa-
tion of the words, and apply simple shallow-
transfer rules that operate on sequences of lexical
forms: this kind of systems do not perform full
parsing. For instance, for translating the English
sentence I like Pierre?s house into French with
the Apertium shallow-transfer RBMT platform we
have used to build our submission, the following
steps are carried out. First, the sentence is anal-
ysed as the following sequence of lexical forms:
I PRN-p:1.num:sg
like VB-t:pres.p:?:num:?
Pierre PN
?s POS
house N-gen:?.num:sg
This sequence is made up of a personal pronoun
(PRN) in first person (p:1) singular (num:sg)
with lemma I, the verb (VB) like in present tense
(t:pres), a proper noun (PN) with lemma Pierre,
the possessive ending (POS), and a noun (N) in sin-
gular with lemma house. Some morphological in-
flection attributes have an empty value ? because
they do not apply to the corresponding language.
Then, structural transfer rules are applied to ob-
tain the TL intermediate representation with the
help of the bilingual dictionary, which provides
the individual translation of each SL lexical form
(including its morphological information). In this
case, two rules are applied: the first one makes the
verb to agree with the personal pronoun, while the
second one translates the English possessive con-
struction into French. The resulting sequence of
TL lexical forms is:
Je PRN-p:1.num:sg
aime VB-t:pres.p:1:num:sg
le DT-gen:f.num:sg
maison N-gen:f.num:sg
de PR
Pierre PN
Note that a preposition (PR) with lemma de and a
determiner (DT) with lemma le and the same gen-
der and number as the common noun have been
added by the rule. Finally, the translation into TL
is generated from the TL lexical forms: J?aime la
maison de Pierre.

3.2 A rule formalism suitable for rule
inference
Figure 1 shows the second rule applied in the
example from the previous section encoded with
the formalism we have defined for rule infer-
ence (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2014). Each rule
contains a sequence of SL word classes (depicted
as the sequence of boxes at the top of the figure)
and TL word classes (the sequence of boxes be-
low them). The sequence of SL word classes de-
fines the set of sequences of lexical forms which
will match the rule. Each SL word class s
i
defines
the conditions that must be met by the i-th lexical
form matching the rule and contains an optional
lemma (no lemma means that any SL lemma is al-
lowed), a lexical category and a set of morpholog-
ical inflection attributes and their expected values.
A wildcard (asterisk) as the value of a morpholog-
ical inflection attribute means that it matches any
possible value. Thus, the rule from the example
matches any proper noun followed by a possessive
ending and a noun, regardless of its gender and
number.
As regards the TL word classes, they contain
the same elements as the SL word classes and de-
fine the output of the rule. An empty lemma in a
TL word class means that it is obtained by looking
up in the bilingual dictionary the SL lexical form
matching the aligned SL word class (alignments
are represented as lines connecting SL and TL
word classes). The reference value $
i
s
means that
the value of a morphological inflection attribute is
copied from the SL lexical form matching the i-th
SL word class, while the reference value $
i
t
means
that the value is taken from the TL lexical form ob-
tained after looking up in the bilingual dictionary
the aforementioned SL lexical form. The rule de-
picted in Figure 1 generates a sequence of four TL
lexical forms. The first one is a determiner whose
lemma is le, its gender is obtained from the gender
of the TL lexical form resulting after looking up in
the bilingual dictionary the third matching SL lex-
ical form ($
3
t
), that is, the common noun, while its
number is directly obtained from the same SL lexi-
cal form before dictionary look-up ($
3
s
). Although
they have not been used in this example, explicit
values can be used in the morphological inflection
attributes of the SL and TL word classes, thus re-
stricting the SL lexical forms to which the rule can
be applied to those having the values in the corre-
sponding SL word classes,
2
and explicitly stating
the value that the TL lexical forms produced by
the rule will have, respectively.
3.3 Rule inference algorithm
The set of rules that will be used to generate the
phrase pairs that will be integrated into the PB-
SMT system?s phrase table, encoded with the for-
malism presented in the previous section, are ob-
tained from the parallel corpus by applying the
steps described in this section. They are a subset
of the steps followed by S?anchez-Cartagena et al.
(2014) to infer shallow-transfer rules to be used in
Apertium from small parallel corpora.
First, both sides of the parallel corpus are mor-
phologically analysed and converted into the inter-
mediate representations used by Apertium. Word
alignments are then obtained by symmetrising
(using the refined intersection method proposed
by Och and Ney (2003)) the set of alignments
provided by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) when
it is run on both translations directions. After-
wards, the bilingual phrase pairs compatible with
the alignments are extracted as it is usually done
in SMT (Koehn, 2010, Sec. 5.2.3), and those that
are not compatible with the bilingual dictionary of
the Apertium English?French RBMT system
3
or
2
In addition to that criterion, our formalism also permits
restricting the application of a rule to the SL lexical forms
that, after being looked up in the bilingual dictionary, the
TL lexical forms obtained from them have specific morpho-
logical inflection attribute values (S?anchez-Cartagena et al.,
2014) although no restrictions of this type are imposed in the
rule depicted in Figure 1.
3
If the words that belong to open lexical categories (those
that carry the meaning of the sentence: nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives, etc.) are aligned with other words that do not match
the translation present in the bilingual dictionary, the rule in-
180
contain punctuation marks or unknown words are
discarded. Finally, from each bilingual phrase pair,
all the possible rules which correctly reproduce it
?when the rule is applied to the SL side of the
phrase pair, its TL side is obtained? are gener-
ated as follows. First, a very specific rule, which
matches only the SL phrase in the bilingual phrase
pair is generated; more general rules are then cre-
ated by modifying this initial rule. The modifica-
tions to the initial rule consist of removing lem-
mas from the SL and TL word classes, introduc-
ing wildcard values in the morphological inflec-
tion attributes of the SL word classes and adding
reference values in the morphological inflection at-
tributes of the TL word classes. The result of this
process is a huge set of rules with different levels
of generalisation. Obviously, not all the rules in
this set will be used: the best ones are automati-
cally selected by considering all the rules obtained
from the different bilingual phrase pairs extracted
from the corpus and finding the minimum set of
rules that meets the following two conditions:
1. Each bilingual phrase pair is correctly repro-
duced by at least one rule.
2. If a rule matches the SL side of bilingual
phrase pair but does not correctly reproduce
its TL side, there is another rule that is more
specific (i.e. less general) than it, and cor-
rectly reproduces its TL side.
This minimisation problem is formulated as an in-
teger linear programming
4
problem (Garfinkel and
Nemhauser, 1972) and solved using the branch
and cut algorithm (Xu et al., 2009).
From the small subset of the huge initial rules
obtained by solving the minimisation problem, the
rules whose effect can be achieved by combining
shorter rules or by translating all or some of the
words in isolation (i.e. word for word) are re-
moved. In this way, the number of rules is further
reduced and long rules, which are more prone to
overgeneralisation because they are inferred from
fewer bilingual phrase pairs, are discarded.
5
ference algorithm is likely to infer many very specific rules
that try to correct that lexical mismatch. Since the aim of
our approach is learning general rules that deal with the
grammatical divergences between languages, the bilingual
phrases that contain the aforementioned alignments are dis-
carded. Words from closed lexical categories, that usually
suffer deeper changes when the sentence is translated to a dif-
ferent language, are not subject to this restriction.
4
An integer linear programming problem involves the op-
timisation (maximisation or minimisation) of a linear objec-
tive function subject to linear inequality constraints.
5
Although longer rules contain more context information,
4 Enhancing phrase-based SMT with
shallow-transfer linguistic resources
The set of shallow-transfer rules inferred from the
parallel corpus are integrated in the PBSMT sys-
tem, together with the RBMT dictionaries, using
the same method we used for our WMT 2011
shared translation task subsmission (S?anchez-
Cartagena et al., 2011b). However, it is important
to stress that, until now, this strategy had only been
tested when the rules to be integrated were hand-
written and not automatically obtained from cor-
pora.
Our strategy involves adding to the phrase ta-
ble of the PBSMT system all the bilingual phrase
pairs which either match a shallow-transfer rule or
an entry in the bilingual dictionary. Generating the
set of bilingual phrase pairs which match bilingual
dictionary entries is straightforward. First, all the
SL surface forms that are recognised by Apertium
and their corresponding lexical forms are gener-
ated. Then, these SL lexical forms are translated
using the bilingual dictionary, and finally their TL
surface forms are generated.
Bilingual phrase pairs which match structural
transfer rules are generated in a similar way. First,
the SL sentences to be translated are analysed with
Apertium to get their SL lexical forms, and then
the sequences of lexical forms that match a struc-
tural transfer rule are translated with that rule and
passed through the rest of the Apertium pipeline
in order to get their translations. If a sequence
of SL lexical forms is matched by more than one
structural transfer rule, it will be used to generate
as many bilingual phrase pairs as different rules
it matches. This differs from the way in which
Apertium translates, as it only applies the longest
rule. Note also that the test set is used to guide the
phrase extraction in order to avoid the generation
of an unmanageable set of phrase pairs.
We add these bilingual phrase pairs directly to
the phrase table, rather than adding them to the
training corpus and relying on the phrase extrac-
tion algorithm (Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.2.3), in order
to avoid splitting the multi-word expressions pro-
vided by Apertium into smaller phrases (Schwenk
et al., 2009, sec. 2). The bilingual phrase pairs
are added only once to the list of corpus-extracted
phrase pairs, and then the phrase translation prob-
abilities are computed by relative frequency as
usual (Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.2.5). A boolean feature
for our rule inferring algorithm there are fewer bilingual
phrases from which to infer them, and consequently fewer
evidence from which to extract the right reference attributes.
181
function to flag bilingual phrase pairs obtained
from the RBMT resources is added to the phrase
table in order to conveniently weight the synthetic
RBMT phrase pairs.
5 System training
We built a baseline PBSMT Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007) system
6
from a subset of the paral-
lel corpora distributed as part of the WMT 2014
shared translation task, namely Europarl (Koehn,
2005), News Commentary and Common Crawl,
and a subset of the French monolingual corpora,
namely Common Crawl, Europarl, News Com-
mentary and News Crawl. The language model
was built with the KenLM language modelling
toolkit (Heafield et al., 2013), which was used
to train a 5-gram language model using inter-
polated Kneser-Ney discounting (Goodman and
Chen, 1998). Word alignments were computed
by means of GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). The
weights of the different feature functions were op-
timised by means of minimum error rate train-
ing (Och, 2003) on the 2013 WMT test set.
7
The phrase table of this baseline system was
then enriched with phrase pairs generated from
rules automatically inferred from the concatena-
tion of the test corpora distributed for the WMT
2008?2012 shared translation tasks, and from the
English?French bilingual dictionary in the Aper-
tium platform.
8
Since the minimisation problem
which needs to be solved in order to obtain the
rules is very time-consuming, we chose a small
rule inference corpus similar to this year?s test set.
The bilingual dictionary, which contains mappings
between SL and TL lemmas, consists of 13 088 en-
tries and is quite small compared to the Spanish?
English bilingual dictionary we used in our sub-
mission to WMT 2011 (S?anchez-Cartagena et al.,
2011b), which consisted of 326 228 bilingual en-
tries. This is because the English?French Aper-
tium linguistic resources were automatically built
by crossing data from other existing language
pairs.
Table 1 summarises the data about the corpora
used to build our submission, both for the PBSMT
baseline system and for the rules used to enrich its
phrase table.

was split into two parts: the larger one (4/5 of
the corpus) was used for actual rule inference as
described in section 3.3; the remaining corpus
was used as a development corpus as explained
next. For each rule z, first the proportion r(z) of
bilingual phrase pairs correctly reproduced by the
rule divided by the number of bilingual phrases
it matches is computed. Rules whose proportion
r(z) is lower than a threshold value ? are then
discarded before solving the minimisation prob-
lem. The value of ? is chosen so that it maximises,
on the development corpus, the BLEU score (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002) obtained by an Apertium-based
system which uses the inferred rules; in our sub-
mission ? = 0.15. In addition, rules that do not
correctly reproduce at least 100 bilingual phrase
pairs were also discarded in order to make the min-
imisation problem computationally feasible.
6 Results and discussion
Table 2 reports the translation performance as
measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),
TER (Snover et al., 2006) and METEOR (Baner-
jee and Lavie, 2005) achieved by the baseline PB-
SMT, our submission (UA-Prompsit), Apertium
when it uses the set of inferred rules, and Aper-
tium when it uses no rules at all (word-for-word
translation). The size of the phrase table and the
amount of unknown words in the test set are also
reported when applicable.
According to the three evaluation metrics, the
translation performance of our submission is very
close to that of the PBSMT baseline (slightly bet-
ter according to BLEU and TER, and slightly
worse according to METEOR). The difference be-
tween both systems computed by paired bootstrap

Table 2: Case-insensitive BLEU, TER, and METEOR scores obtained, on the newstest2014 test set, by
the baseline PBSMT system (baseline), the hybrid system submitted to the WMT 2014 shared translation
task (UA-Prompsit), Apertium when it uses the set of inferred rules (Apertium-rules), and Apertium
when it uses no rules at all (Apertium-word-for-word). The number of unknown words and the size of
the phrase table are also reported when applicable.
resampling (Koehn, 2004) is not statistically sig-
nificant for any of the three evaluation metrics
(1 000 iterations, p = 0.05).
An inspection of the 86 rules inferred shows
that they encode some of the transformations that
one would expect from a set of English?French
rules, such as gender and number agreements be-
tween nouns, determiners and adjectives, prepo-
sition changes, and the introduction of the aux-
iliary verb avoir for the past tense. In addition,
the improvement over word-for-word translation
achieved when they are used by Apertium is statis-
tically significant for the three evaluation metrics.
One of the reasons for not improving the base-
line PBMT system might be the small coverage
of the Apertium dictionaries. As already men-
tioned in the previous section, the English?French
bilingual dictionary has a low number of entries
compared to more mature language pairs in Aper-
tium which have around 20 times more bilingual
entries. Table 1 shows some effects of such a
small dictionary: the number of unknown words
for the Apertium-based system is really high, and
with regards to UA-Prompsit, its coverage barely
increases when compared to the PBSMT baseline.
We plan to test the approach presented in this paper
with language pairs for which more mature dictio-
naries are available in the Apertium project.
In addition to this, due to the tight schedule, we
had to remove the rules not reproducing at least
100 bilingual phrase pairs in order to solve the min-
imisation problem in a short amount of time. This
has clearly reduced the amount of rules inferred
and prevented some useful information present in
the parallel corpus from being incorporated in the
form of rules. For instance, no rule matching a
sequence longer than 3 lexical forms has been ex-
tracted (long bilingual phrases are less frequent
than short ones). Future research directions for
alleviating this problem include setting the mini-
mum number of reproduced bilingual phrases in-
dependently for each sequence of SL lexical cate-
gories (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2014).
7 Concluding remarks
We have presented the MT system submitted
jointly by the Departament de Llenguatges i Sis-
temes Inform`atics at Universitat d?Alacant and
Prompsit Language Engineering to the WMT
2014 shared translation task. We developed a
hybrid system for the English?French language
pair which enriches the phrase table of a stan-
dard PBSMT system with phrase pairs generated
from the Apertium RBMT dictionaries and a set of
shallow-transfer rules automatically inferred from
a parallel corpus, also with the help of the dic-
tionaries. This submission aims at solving one
strong limitation of a previous submission of our
team (S?anchez-Cartagena et al., 2011b): the need
for a hand-crafted set of shallow-transfer rules,
which can only be written by people with a deep
knowledge of the languages involved. Our ap-
proach outperforms a standard PBSMT system
built from the same data by a small, non statisti-
cally significant margin, according to two of the
three evaluation metrics used. The low coverage
of the dictionaries used and the aggressive pruning
carried out when solving the minimisation prob-
lem needed to infer the rules are probably the rea-
sons behind such a small improvement over the
baseline.
