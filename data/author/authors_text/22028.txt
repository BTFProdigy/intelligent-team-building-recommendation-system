Abstract
The sociolinguistic situation in Arabic countries is characterized by diglossia (Ferguson, 1959) :
whereas one variant Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is highly codified and mainly used for writ-
ten communication, other variants coexist in regular everyday?s situations (dialects). Similarly,
while a number of resources and tools exist for MSA (lexica, annotated corpora, taggers, parsers
. . . ), very few are available for the development of dialectal Natural Language Processing tools.
Taking advantage of the closeness of MSA and its dialects, one way to solve the problem of the
lack of resources for dialects consists in exploiting available MSA resources and NLP tools in
order to adapt them to process dialects. This paper adopts this general framework: we propose a
method to build a lexicon of deverbal nouns for Tunisian (TUN) using MSA tools and resources
as starting material.
1 Introduction
The Arabic language presents both a standard written form and a number of spoken variants (dialects).
While dialects differ from one country to another, sometimes even within the same country, the written
variety (Modern Standard Arabic, MSA), is the same for all the Arabic countries. Similarly, MSA is
highly codified, and used mainly for written communication and formal spoken situations (news, political
debates). Spoken varieties are used in informal daily discussions and in informal written communication
on the web (social networks, blogs and forums). Such unstandardized varieties differ from MSA with
respect to phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon. Linguistic resources (lexica, corpora) and
natural language processing (NLP) tools for such dialects (parsers) are very rare.
Different approaches are discussed in the litterature to cope with Arabic dialects processing. A gen-
eral solution is to build specific resources and tools. For example, (Maamouri et al., 2004) created a
Levantine annotated corpus (oral transcriptions) for speech recognition research. (Habash et al., 2005;
Habash and Rambow, 2006) proposed a system including a morphological analyzer and a generator for
Arabic dialects (MAGEAD) used for MSA and Levantine Arabic. (Habash et al., 2012) also built a
morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic that extends an existing resource, the Egyptian Colloquial
Arabic Lexicon. Other approaches take advantage of the special relation (closeness) that exists betweeen
MSA and dialects in order to adapt MSA resources and tools to dialects. To name a few, (Chiang et
al., 2006) used MSA treebanks to parse Levantine Arabic. (Sawaf, 2010) presented a translation system
for handling dialectal Arabic, using an algorithm to normalize spontaneous and dialectal Arabic into
MSA. (Salloum and Habash, 2013) developped a translation system pivoting through MSA from some
Arabic dialects (Levantine, Egyptian, Iraqi, and Gulf Arabic) to English. (Hamdi et al., 2013) proposed
a translation system between Tunisian (TUN) and MSA verbs using an analyser and a generator for both
variants.
Yet if the first kind of approach is more linguistically accurate because it takes into account specificities
of each dialect, building resources from scratch is costly and extremely time consuming. In this paper
we will thus adopt the second approach: we will present a method to automatically build a lexicon for
Tunisian deverbal nouns by exploiting available MSA resources as well as an existing MSA-TUN lexicon

for verbs (Boujelbane et al., 2013). We will use a root lexicon to generate possible deverbal nouns which
will be later filtered through a large MSA lexicon.
This work is part of a larger project that aims at ?translating? TUN to an approximative form of MSA
in order to use MSA NLP tools on the output of this translation process. The final lexicon for TUN
deverbal nouns will be integrated into a morphological and syntactic parser for TUN.
The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe and compare some morphological aspects
of MSA and TUN, focusing on derivation. We then discuss in section 3 our approach to build a TUN lex-
icon for deverbal nouns from an existing MSA-TUN resource for verbs. Section 4 presents an evaluation
of the results obtained and section 5 proposes some solutions to increase the coverage of the lexicon.
2 Arabic Morphology
Arabic words are built following two kinds of morphological operations: templatic and affixational.
Functionally, both operations are used inflectionally or derivationally (Habash, 2010). In templatic mor-
phology, a root and a pattern combine to form a word stem. A root is a sequence of three, four or five
letters that defines an abstract notion while a pattern is a vocalized template which marks where the root
radicals are inserted. To give an example, by combining the root h

with the verbal patterns
1a2a3 and ta1a22a3, two verbs are generated : (1) i

J
	
? fataH ?to open? and (2) i

K tafattaH ?to bloom?.
Derivation consists in replacing each digit of the pattern by the corresponding letter in the root.
Arabic verbs have ten basic triliteral patterns, which are conventionally noted with the Latin numbers
I, . . . , X. and two basic quadriliteral patterns (XI, XII) (Habash, 2010). A verb is the combination of a
root and a pattern.
Many deverbal nouns can be derived from verbs. Nine kind of deverbal nouns (1, 2, 3 ... 9) are defined
in Arabic (Al-Ghulayaini, 2010), each of them corresponds to a semantic relationship between the verb
and the deverbal noun (see table 1).
