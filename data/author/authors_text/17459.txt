Abstract
The Parlance system for interactive
search processes dialogue at a micro-
turn level, displaying dialogue phe-
nomena that play a vital role in hu-
man spoken conversation. These di-
alogue phenomena include more nat-
ural turn-taking through rapid sys-
tem responses, generation of backchan-
nels, and user barge-ins. The Par-
lance demonstration system differen-
tiates from other incremental systems
in that it is data-driven with an infras-
tructure that scales well.
1 Introduction
The Parlance system provides interactive
search through a Spoken Dialogue System
(SDS). This SDS aims to be incremental to al-
low for more natural spoken interaction. Tra-
ditionally, the smallest unit of speech process-
ing for interactive systems has been a full ut-
terance with strict, rigid turn-taking. The
Parlance architecture, however, is an incre-
mental framework that allows for processing
of smaller ?chunks? of user input, which en-
ables one to model dialogue phenomena such
as barge-ins and backchannels. This work is
carried out under the FP7 EC project Par-
lance 1, the goal of which is to develop inter-
active search through speech in multiple lan-
guages. The domain for the demonstration
system is interactive search for restaurants in
San Francisco. An example dialogue is given
in Table 1.

2 Background
Previous work includes systems that can deal
with ?micro-turns? (i.e. sub-utterance process-
ing units), resulting in dialogues that are more
fluid and responsive. This has been backed up
by a large body of psycholinguistic literature
that indicates that human-human interaction
is in fact incremental (Levelt, 1989).
It has been shown that incremental dia-
logue behaviour can improve the user experi-
ence (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009; Baumann
et al, 2011; Selfridge et al, 2011) and en-
able the system designer to model several di-
alogue phenomena that play a vital role in
human discourse (Levelt, 1989) but have so
far been absent from systems. These dialogue
phenomena that will be demonstrated by the
Parlance system include more natural turn-
taking through rapid system responses, gener-
ation of backchannels and user barge-ins. The
system differentiates from other incremental
systems in that it is entirely data-driven with
an infrastructure that potentially scales well.

the modularity of a traditional SDS while at
the same time allowing for complex interaction
at the micro-turn level between components.
Each component described below makes use
of the PINC (Parlance INCremental) dialogue
act schema. In this scheme, a complete dia-
logue act is made up of a set of primitive di-
alogue acts which are defined as acttype-item
pairs. The PINC dialogue act scheme supports
incrementality by allowing SLU to incremen-
tally output primitive dialogue acts whenever
a complete acttype-item pair is recognised with
sufficient confidence. The complete dialogue
act is then the set of these primitive acts out-
put during the utterance.
3.1 Recognition and Understanding
The Automatic Speech Recogniser (ASR) and
Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) com-
ponents operate in two passes. The audio in-
put is segmented by a Voice Activity Detec-
tor and then coded into feature vectors. For
the first pass of the ASR2, a fast bigram de-
coder performs continuous traceback generat-
ing word by word output. During this pass,
while the user is speaking, an SLU module
called the ?segment decoder? is called incre-
2http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dialogue/
ATK_Manual.pdf
mentally as words or phrases are recognised.
This module incrementally outputs the set of
primitive dialogue acts that can be detected
based on each utterance prefix. Here, the ASR
only provides the single best hypothesis, and
SLU only outputs a single set of primitive dia-
logue acts, without an associated probability.
On request from the Micro-turn Interaction
Manager (MIM), a second pass can be per-
formed to restore the current utterance using a
trigram language model, and return a full dis-
tribution over the complete phrase as a con-
fusion network. This is then passed to the
SLU module which outputs the set of alter-
native complete interpretations, each with its
associated probability, thus reflecting the un-
certainty in the ASR-SLU understanding pro-
cess.
3.2 Interaction Management
Figure 1 illustrates the role of the Micro-turn
Interaction Manager (MIM) component in the
overall Parlance architecture. In order to
allow for natural interaction, the MIM is re-
sponsible for taking actions such as listening to
the user, taking the floor, and generating back-
channels at the micro-turn level. Given various
features from different components, the MIM
selects a micro-turn action and sends it to the
IM and back-channel generator component to
generate a system response.
Micro-turn Interaction Manager A
baseline hand-crafted MIM was developed
using predefined rules. It receives turn-taking
information from the TTS, the audio-output
component, the ASR and a timer, and updates
turn-taking features. Based on the current
features and predefined rules, it generates
control signals and sends them to the TTS,
ASR, timer and HUB. In terms of micro-turn
taking, for example, if the user interrupts
the system utterance, the system will stop
speaking and listen to the user. The system
also outputs a short back-channel and stays in
user turn state if the user utterance provides
limited information.
Interaction Manager Once the MIM has
decided when the system should take the floor,
it is the task of the IM to decide what to say.
The IM is based on the partially observable
155
Markov decision process (POMDP) frame-
work, where the system?s decisions can be op-
timised via reinforcement learning. The model
adopted for Parlance is the Bayesian Update
of Dialogue State (BUDS) manager (Thom-
son and Young, 2010). This POMDP-based
IM factors the dialogue state into condition-
ally dependent elements. Dependencies be-
tween these elements can be derived directly
from the dialogue ontology. These elements
are arranged into a dynamic Bayesian network
which allows for their marginal probabilities
to be updated during the dialogue, compris-
ing the belief state. The belief state is then
mapped into a smaller-scale summary space
and the decisions are optimised using the nat-
ural actor critic algorithm.
HUB The HUB manages the high level flow
of information. It receives turn change infor-
mation from the MIM and sends commands
to the SLU/IM/NLG to ?take the floor? in the
conversation and generate a response.
3.3 Generation and TTS
We aim to automatically generate language,
trained from data, that is (1) grammatically
well formed, (2) natural, (3) cohesive and (4)
rapidly produced at runtime. Whilst the first
two requirements are important in any dia-
logue system, the latter two are key require-
ments for systems with incremental processing,
in order to be more responsive. This includes
generating back-channels, dynamic content re-
ordering (Dethlefs et al, 2012), and surface
generation that models coherent discourse phe-
nomena, such as pronominalisation and co-
reference (Dethlefs et al, 2013). Incremen-
tal surfacce generation requires rich context
awareness in order to keep track of all that has
been generated so far. We therefore treat sur-
face realisation as a sequence labelling task and
use Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which
take semantically annotated phrase structure
trees as input, in order to represent long dis-
tance linguistic dependencies. This approach
has been compared with a number of compet-
itive state-of-the art surface realisers (Deth-
lefs et al, 2013), and can be trained from
minimally labelled data to reduce development
time and facilitate its application to new do-
mains.
The TTS component uses a trainable HMM-
based speech synthesizer. As it is a paramet-
ric model, HMM-TTS has more flexibility than
traditional unit-selection approaches and is es-
pecially useful for producing expressive speech.
3.4 Local Search and Knowledge Base
The domain ontology is populated by the local
search component and contains restaurants in
5 regional areas of San Francisco. Restaurant
search results are returned based on their lon-
gitude and latitude for 3 price ranges and 52
cuisine types.
4 Future Work
We intend to perform a task-based evaluation
using crowd-sourced users. Future versions
will use a dynamic Knowledge Base and User
Model for adapting to evolving domains and
personalised interaction respectively.

Abstract
We demonstrate a mobile application in
English and Mandarin to test and eval-
uate components of the Parlance di-
alogue system for interactive search un-
der real-world conditions.
1 Introduction
With the advent of evaluations ?in the wild?,
emphasis is being put on converting re-
search prototypes into mobile applications that
can be used for evaluation and data col-
lection by real users downloading the ap-
plication from the market place. This is
the motivation behind the work demonstrated
here where we present a modular framework
whereby research components from the Par-
lance project (Hastie et al., 2013) can be
plugged in, tested and evaluated in a mobile
environment.
The goal of Parlance is to perform inter-
active search through speech in multiple lan-
guages. The domain for the demonstration
system is interactive search for restaurants in
Cambridge, UK for Mandarin and San Fran-
cisco, USA for English. The scenario is that
Mandarin speaking tourists would be able to
download the application and use it to learn
about restaurants in English speaking towns
and cities.
2 System Architecture
Here, we adopt a client-server approach as il-
lustrated in Figure 1 for Mandarin and Figure
2 for English. The front end of the demon-
stration system is an Android application that
calls the Google Automatic Speech Recogni-
tion (ASR) API and sends the recognized user
utterance to a server running the Interaction
?Authors are in alphabetical order
Manager (IM), Spoken Language Understand-
ing (SLU) and Natural Language Generation
(NLG) components.

darin mobile application system architecture

glish mobile application system architecture
extended to use the Yahoo API to populate
the application with additional restaurant in-
formation
When the user clicks the Start button, a di-
alogue session starts. The phone application
first connects to the Parlance server (via
the Java Socket Server) to get the initial sys-
tem greeting which it speaks via the Google
260
Text-To-Speech (TTS) API. After the system
utterance finishes the recognizer starts to lis-
ten for user input to send to the SLU compo-
nent. The SLU converts text into a semantic
interpretation consisting of a set of triples of
communicative function, attribute, and (op-
tionally) value1. Probabilities can be associ-
ated with candidate interpretations to reflect
uncertainty in either the ASR or SLU. The
SLU then passes the semantic interpretation
to the IM within the same server.
Chinese sentences are composed of strings of
characters without any space to mark words as
other languages do, for example:
In order to correctly parse and understand
Chinese sentences, Chinese word segmenta-
tions must be performed. To do this segmen-
tation, we use the Stanford Chinese word seg-
mentor2, which relies on a linear-chain condi-
tional random field (CRF) model and treats
word segmentation as a binary decision task.
The Java Socket Server then sends the seg-
mented Chinese sentence to the SLU on the
server.
The IM then selects a dialogue act, accesses
the database and in the case of English passes
back the list of restaurant identification num-
bers (ids) associated with the relevant restau-
rants. For the English demonstration system,
these restaurants are displayed on the smart
phone as seen in Figures 4 and 5. Finally,
the NLG component decides how best to re-
alise the restaurant descriptions and sends the
string back to the phone application for the
TTS to realise. The example output is illus-
trated in Figure 3 for Mandarin and Figure 4
for English.
As discussed above, the Parlance mobile
application can be used as a test-bed for com-
paring alternative techniques for various com-
ponents. Here we discuss two such compo-
nents: IM and NLG.
1This has been implemented for English; Mandarin
uses the rule-based Phoenix parser.

2.1 Interaction Management
The Parlance Interaction Manager is based
on the partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) framework, where the sys-
tem?s decisions can be optimised via reinforce-
ment learning. The model adopted for Par-
lance is the Bayesian Update of Dialogue
State (BUDS) manager (Thomson and Young,
2010). This POMDP-based IM factors the di-
alogue state into conditionally dependent ele-
ments. Dependencies between these elements
can be derived directly from the dialogue on-
tology. These elements are arranged into a dy-
namic Bayesian network which allows for their
marginal probabilities to be updated during
the dialogue, comprising the belief state. The
belief state is then mapped into a smaller-scale
summary space and the decisions are optimised
using the natural actor critic algorithm. In the
Parlance application, hand-crafted policies
261
Figure 5: Screenshot of the recommended
restaurant for the English application
can be compared to learned ones.
2.2 Natural Language Generation
As mentioned above, the server returns the
string to be synthesised by the Google TTS
API. This mobile framework allows for testing
of alternative approaches to NLG. In particu-
lar, we are interested in comparing a surface re-
aliser that uses CRFs against a template-based
baseline. The CRFs take semantically anno-
tated phrase structure trees as input, which it
uses to keep track of rich linguistic contexts.
Our approach has been compared with a num-
ber of competitive state-of-the art surface real-
izers (Dethlefs et al., 2013), and can be trained
from example sentences with annotations of se-
mantic slots.
2.3 Local Search and Knowledge Base
For the English system, the domain database is
populated by the search Yahoo API (Bouchard
and Mika, 2013) with restaurants in San Fran-
sisco. These restaurant search results are
returned based on their longitude and lati-
tude within San Francisco for 5 main areas, 3
price categories and 52 cuisine types contain-
ing around 1,600 individual restaurants.
The Chinese database has been partially
translated from an English database for restau-
rants in Cambridge, UK and search is based
on 3 price categories, 5 areas and 35 cuisine
types having a total of 157 restaurants. Due
to the language-agnostic nature of the Par-
lance system, only the name and address
fields needed to be translated.
3 Future Work
Investigating application side audio compres-
sion and audio streaming over a mobile in-
ternet connection would enable further assess-
ment of the ASR and TTS components used
in the original Parlance system (Hastie et
al., 2013). This would allow for entire research
systems to be plugged directly into the mobile
interface without the use of third party ASR
and TTS.
Future work also involves developing a feed-
back mechanism for evaluation purposes that
does not put undue effort on the user and put
them off using the application. In addition,
this framework can be extended to leverage
hyperlocal and social information of the user
when displaying items of interest.
