Abstract
We develop an instance (token) based extension of the state of the art word (type) based part-of-
speech induction system introduced in (Yatbaz et al., 2012). Each word instance is represented
by a feature vector that combines information from the target word and probable substitutes
sampled from an n-gram model representing its context. Modeling ambiguity using an instance
based model does not lead to significant gains in overall accuracy in part-of-speech tagging be-
cause most words in running text are used in their most frequent class (e.g. 93.69% in the
Penn Treebank). However it is important to model ambiguity because most frequent words are
ambiguous and not modeling them correctly may negatively affect upstream tasks. Our main
contribution is to show that an instance based model can achieve significantly higher accuracy on
ambiguous words at the cost of a slight degradation on unambiguous ones, maintaining a compa-
rable overall accuracy. On the Penn Treebank, the overall many-to-one accuracy of the system is
within 1% of the state-of-the-art (80%), while on highly ambiguous words it is up to 70% better.
On multilingual experiments our results are significantly better than or comparable to the best
published word or instance based systems on 15 out of 19 corpora in 15 languages. The vector
representations for words used in our system are available for download for further experiments.
1 Introduction
Unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction aims to classify words into syntactic categories using un-
labeled, plain text input. The problem of induction is important for studying under-resourced languages
that lack labeled corpora and high quality dictionaries. It is also essential in modeling child language
acquisition because every child manages to induce syntactic categories without access to labeled sen-
tences, labeled prototypes, or dictionary constraints (Ambridge and Lieven, 2011). Categories induced
from data may point to shortcomings or inconsistencies of hand-labeled categories as discussed in Sec-
tion 4. Finally, the induced categories or the vector representations generated by the induction algorithms
may improve natural language processing systems when used as additional features.
Word-based POS induction systems classify different instances of a word in a single category (which
we will refer to as the one-tag-per-word assumption). Instance-based systems classify each occurence of
a word separately and can handle ambiguous words.
Examples of word-based systems include ones that represent each word with the vector of neighboring
words (context vectors) and cluster them (Sch?utze, 1995; Lamar et al., 2010b; Lamar et al., 2010a), use
a prototypical bi-tag HMM that assigns each word to a latent class (Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2003),
restrict a HMM based Pitman-Yor process to perform one-tag-per-word inference (Blunsom and Cohn,
2011), define a word-based Bayesian multinomial mixture model (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011), or

Abstract
We investigate paradigmatic representations
of word context in the domain of unsupervised
syntactic category acquisition. Paradigmatic
representations of word context are based on
potential substitutes of a word in contrast to
syntagmatic representations based on prop-
erties of neighboring words. We compare
a bigram based baseline model with several
paradigmatic models and demonstrate signif-
icant gains in accuracy. Our best model based
on Euclidean co-occurrence embedding com-
bines the paradigmatic context representation
with morphological and orthographic features
and achieves 80% many-to-one accuracy on a
45-tag 1M word corpus.
1 Introduction
Grammar rules apply not to individual words (e.g.
dog, eat) but to syntactic categories of words (e.g.
noun, verb). Thus constructing syntactic categories
(also known as lexical or part-of-speech categories)
is one of the fundamental problems in language ac-
quisition.
Syntactic categories represent groups of words
that can be substituted for one another without alter-
ing the grammaticality of a sentence. Linguists iden-
tify syntactic categories based on semantic, syntac-
tic, and morphological properties of words. There is
also evidence that children use prosodic and phono-
logical features to bootstrap syntactic category ac-
quisition (Ambridge and Lieven, 2011). However
there is as yet no satisfactory computational model
that can match human performance. Thus identify-
ing the best set of features and best learning algo-
rithms for syntactic category acquisition is still an
open problem.
Relationships between linguistic units can be
classified into two types: syntagmatic (concerning
positioning), and paradigmatic (concerning substitu-
tion). Syntagmatic relations determine which units
can combine to create larger groups and paradig-
matic relations determine which units can be sub-
stituted for one another. Figure 1 illustrates the
paradigmatic vs syntagmatic axes for words in a
simple sentence and their possible substitutes.
In this study, we represent the paradigmatic axis
directly by building substitute vectors for each word
position in the text. The dimensions of a substi-
tute vector represent words in the vocabulary, and
the magnitudes represent the probability of occur-
rence in the given position. Note that the substitute
vector for a word position (e.g. the second word in
Fig. 1) is a function of the context only (i.e. ?the
cried?), and does not depend on the word that
does actually appear there (i.e. ?man?). Thus substi-

in a simple sentence (Chandler, 2007).
940
tute vectors represent individual word contexts, not
word types. We refer to the use of features based on
substitute vectors as paradigmatic representations of
word context.
Our preliminary experiments indicated that using
context information alone without the identity or the
features of the target word (e.g. using dimension-
ality reduction and clustering on substitute vectors)
has limited success and modeling the co-occurrence
of word and context types is essential for inducing
syntactic categories. In the models presented in this
paper, we combine paradigmatic representations of
word context with features of co-occurring words
within the co-occurrence data embedding (CODE)
framework (Globerson et al 2007; Maron et al
2010). The resulting embeddings for word types are
split into 45 clusters using k-means and the clusters
are compared to the 45 gold tags in the 1M word
Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Mar-
cus et al 1999). We obtain many-to-one accura-
cies up to .7680 using only distributional informa-
tion (the identity of the word and a representation of
its context) and .8023 using morphological and or-
thographic features of words improving the state-of-
the-art in unsupervised part-of-speech tagging per-
formance.
The high probability substitutes reflect both se-
mantic and syntactic properties of the context as
seen in the example below (the numbers in paren-
theses give substitute probabilities):
?Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the
board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29.?
the: its (.9011), the (.0981), a (.0006), . . .
board: board (.4288), company (.2584),
firm (.2024), bank (.0731), . . .
Top substitutes for the word ?the? consist of
words that can act as determiners. Top substitutes
for ?board? are not only nouns, but specifically
nouns compatible with the semantic context.
This example illustrates two concerns inherent in
all distributional methods: (i) words that are gener-
ally substitutable like ?the? and ?its? are placed in
separate categories (DT and PRP$) by the gold stan-
dard, (ii) words that are generally not substitutable
like ?do? and ?put? are placed in the same category
(VB). Freudenthal et al(2005) point out that cat-
egories with unsubstitutable words fail the standard
linguistic definition of a syntactic category and chil-
dren do not seem to make errors of substituting such
words in utterances (e.g. ?What do you want?? vs.
*?What put you want??). Whether gold standard
part-of-speech tags or distributional categories are
better suited to applications like parsing or machine
translation can be best decided using extrinsic eval-
uation. However in this study we follow previous
work and evaluate our results by comparing them to
gold standard part-of-speech tags.

of the substitute vectors. Section 4 describes co-
occurrence data embedding, the learning algorithm

2 Related Work
There are several good reviews of algorithms
for unsupervised part-of-speech induction
(Christodoulopoulos et al 2010; Gao and Johnson,
2008) and models of syntactic category acquisition
(Ambridge and Lieven, 2011).
This work is to be distinguished from supervised
part-of-speech disambiguation systems, which use
labeled training data (Church, 1988), unsupervised
disambiguation systems, which use a dictionary of
possible tags for each word (Merialdo, 1994), or
prototype driven systems which use a small set
of prototypes for each class (Haghighi and Klein,
2006). The problem of induction is important for
studying under-resourced languages that lack la-
beled corpora and high quality dictionaries. It is also
essential in modeling child language acquisition be-
cause every child manages to induce syntactic cat-
egories without access to labeled sentences, labeled
prototypes, or dictionary constraints.
Models of unsupervised part-of-speech induction
fall into two broad groups based on the information
they utilize. Distributional models only use word
941
types and their context statistics. Word-feature mod-
els incorporate additional morphological and ortho-
graphic features.
2.1 Distributional models
Distributional models can be further categorized into
three subgroups based on the learning algorithm.
The first subgroup represents each word type with its
context vector and clusters these vectors accordingly
(Schu?tze, 1995). Work in modeling child syntac-
tic category acquisition has generally followed this
clustering approach (Redington et al 1998; Mintz,
2003). The second subgroup consists of proba-
bilistic models based on the Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) framework (Brown et al 1992). A third
group of algorithms constructs a low dimensional
representation of the data that represents the empir-
ical co-occurrence statistics of word types (Glober-
son et al 2007), which is covered in more detail in
Section 4.
Clustering: Clustering based methods represent
context using neighboring words, typically a sin-
gle word on the left and a single word on the right
called a ?frame? (e.g., the dog is; the cat is). They
cluster word types rather than word tokens based on
the frames they occupy thus employing one-tag-per-
word assumption from the beginning (with the ex-
ception of some methods in (Schu?tze, 1995)). They
may suffer from data sparsity caused by infrequent
words and infrequent contexts. The solutions sug-
gested either restrict the set of words and set of con-
texts to be clustered to the most frequently observed,
or use dimensionality reduction. Redington et al
(1998) define context similarity based on the num-
ber of common frames bypassing the data sparsity
problem but achieve mediocre results. Mintz (2003)
only uses the most frequent 45 frames and Biemann
(2006) clusters the most frequent 10,000 words us-
ing contexts formed from the most frequent 150-200
words. Schu?tze (1995) and Lamar et al(2010b)
employ SVD to enhance similarity between less fre-
quently observed words and contexts. Lamar et al
(2010a) represent each context by the currently as-
signed left and right tag (which eliminates data spar-
sity) and cluster word types using a soft k-means
style iterative algorithm. They report the best clus-
tering result to date of .708 many-to-one accuracy
on a 45-tag 1M word corpus.
HMMs: The prototypical bitag HMM model max-
imizes the likelihood of the corpus w1 . . . wn
expressed as P (w1|c1)
?n
i=2 P (wi|ci)P (ci|ci?1)
where wi are the word tokens and ci are their (hid-
den) tags. One problem with such a model is its ten-
dency to distribute probabilities equally and the re-
sulting inability to model highly skewed word-tag
distributions observed in hand-labeled data (John-
son, 2007). To favor sparse word-tag distributions
one can enforce a strict one-tag-per-word solution
(Brown et al 1992; Clark, 2003), use sparse pri-
ors in a Bayesian setting (Goldwater and Griffiths,
2007; Johnson, 2007), or use posterior regulariza-
tion (Ganchev et al 2010). Each of these techniques
provide significant improvements over the standard
HMM model: for example Gao and Johnson (2008)
show that sparse priors can gain from 4% (.62 to .66
with a 1M word corpus) in cross-validated many-
to-one accuracy. However Christodoulopoulos et al
(2010) show that the older one-tag-per-word models
such as (Brown et al 1992) outperform the more
sophisticated sparse prior and posterior regulariza-
tion methods both in speed and accuracy (the Brown
model gets .68 many-to-one accuracy with a 1M
word corpus). Given that close to 95% of the word
occurrences in human labeled data are tagged with
their most frequent part of speech (Lee et al 2010),
this is probably not surprising; one-tag-per-word is
a fairly good first approximation for induction.
2.2 Word-feature models
One problem with the algorithms in the previous
section is the poverty of their input features. Of the
syntactic, semantic, and morphological information
linguists claim underlie syntactic categories, con-
text vectors or bitag HMMs only represent limited
syntactic information in their input. Experiments
incorporating morphological and orthographic fea-
tures into HMM based models demonstrate signifi-
cant improvements. (Clark, 2003; Berg-Kirkpatrick
and Klein, 2010; Blunsom and Cohn, 2011) incor-
porate similar orthographic features and report im-
provements of 3, 7, and 10% respectively over the
baseline Brown model. Christodoulopoulos et al
(2010) use prototype based features as described in
(Haghighi and Klein, 2006) with automatically in-
942
duced prototypes and report an 8% improvement
over the baseline Brown model. Christodoulopou-
los et al(2011) define a type-based Bayesian multi-
nomial mixture model in which each word instance
is generated from the corresponding word type mix-
ture component and word contexts are represented
as features. They achieve a .728 MTO score by ex-
tending their model with additional morphological
and alignment features gathered from parallel cor-
pora. To our knowledge, nobody has yet tried to
incorporate phonological or prosodic features in a
computational model for syntactic category acquisi-
tion.
2.3 Paradigmatic representations
Sahlgren (2006) gives a detailed analysis of paradig-
matic and syntagmatic relations in the context of
word-space models used to represent word mean-
ing. Sahlgren?s paradigmatic model represents word
types using co-occurrence counts of their frequent
neighbors, in contrast to his syntagmatic model that
represents word types using counts of contexts (doc-
uments, sentences) they occur in. Our substitute
vectors do not represent word types at all, but con-
texts of word tokens using probabilities of likely sub-
stitutes. Sahlgren finds that in word-spaces built by
frequent neighbor vectors, more nearest neighbors
share the same part-of-speech compared to word-
spaces built by context vectors. We find that rep-
resenting the paradigmatic axis more directly using
substitute vectors rather than frequent neighbors im-
prove part-of-speech induction.
Our paradigmatic representation is also related to
the second order co-occurrences used in (Schu?tze,
1995). Schu?tze concatenates the left and right con-
text vectors for the target word type with the left con-
text vector of the right neighbor and the right con-
text vector of the left neighbor. The vectors from the
neighbors include potential substitutes. Our method
improves on his foundation by using a 4-gram lan-
guage model rather than bigram statistics, using the
whole 78,498 word vocabulary rather than the most
frequent 250 words. More importantly, rather than
simply concatenating vectors that represent the tar-
get word with vectors that represent the context we
use S-CODE to model their co-occurrence statistics.
2.4 Evaluation
We report many-to-one and V-measure scores for
our experiments as suggested in (Christodoulopou-
los et al 2010). The many-to-one (MTO) evaluation
maps each cluster to its most frequent gold tag and
reports the percentage of correctly tagged instances.
The MTO score naturally gets higher with increas-
ing number of clusters but it is an intuitive met-
ric when comparing results with the same number
of clusters. The V-measure (VM) (Rosenberg and
Hirschberg, 2007) is an information theoretic met-
ric that reports the harmonic mean of homogeneity
(each cluster should contain only instances of a sin-
gle class) and completeness (all instances of a class
should be members of the same cluster). In Sec-
tion 6 we argue that homogeneity is perhaps more
important in part-of-speech induction and suggest
MTO with a fixed number of clusters as a more in-
tuitive metric.
3 Substitute Vectors
In this study, we predict the part of speech of a word
in a given context based on its substitute vector. The
dimensions of the substitute vector represent words
in the vocabulary, and the entries in the substitute
vector represent the probability of those words be-
ing used in the given context. Note that the substi-
tute vector is a function of the context only and is
indifferent to the target word. This section details
the choice of the data set, the vocabulary and the es-
timation of substitute vector probabilities.
The Wall Street Journal Section of the Penn Tree-
bank (Marcus et al 1999) was used as the test cor-
pus (1,173,766 tokens, 49,206 types). The tree-
bank uses 45 part-of-speech tags which is the set we
used as the gold standard for comparison in our ex-
periments. To compute substitute probabilities we
trained a language model using approximately 126
million tokens of Wall Street Journal data (1987-
1994) extracted from CSR-III Text (Graff et al
1995) (we excluded the test corpus). We used
SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) to build a 4-gram language
model with Kneser-Ney discounting. Words that
were observed less than 20 times in the language
model training data were replaced by UNK tags,
which gave us a vocabulary size of 78,498. The per-
plexity of the 4-gram language model on the test cor-
943
pus is 96.
It is best to use both left and right context when
estimating the probabilities for potential lexical sub-
stitutes. For example, in ?He lived in San Francisco
suburbs.?, the token San would be difficult to guess
from the left context but it is almost certain look-
ing at the right context. We define cw as the 2n ? 1
word window centered around the target word posi-
tion: w?n+1 . . . w0 . . . wn?1 (n = 4 is the n-gram
order). The probability of a substitute word w in a
given context cw can be estimated as:
P (w0 = w|cw) ? P (w?n+1 . . . w0 . . . wn?1)(1)
= P (w?n+1)P (w?n+2|w?n+1)
. . . P (wn?1|w
n?2
?n+1) (2)
? P (w0|w
?1
?n+1)P (w1|w
0
?n+2)
. . . P (wn?1|w
n?2
0 ) (3)
where wji represents the sequence of words
wiwi+1 . . . wj . In Equation 1, P (w|cw) is pro-
portional to P (w?n+1 . . . w0 . . . wn+1) because the
words of the context are fixed. Terms without w0
are identical for each substitute in Equation 2 there-
fore they have been dropped in Equation 3. Finally,
because of the Markov property of n-gram language
model, only the closest n ? 1 words are used in the
experiments.
Near the sentence boundaries the appropriate
terms were truncated in Equation 3. Specifically, at
the beginning of the sentence shorter n-gram con-
texts were used and at the end of the sentence terms
beyond the end-of-sentence token were dropped.
For computational efficiency only the top 100
substitutes and their unnormalized probabilities
were computed for each of the 1,173,766 positions
in the test set1. The probability vectors for each po-
sition were normalized to add up to 1.0 giving us the
final substitute vectors used in the rest of this study.
1The substitutes with unnormalized log probabilities can be
downloaded from http://goo.gl/jzKH0. For a descrip-
tion of the FASTSUBS algorithm used to generate the substitutes
please see http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5407v1.
FASTSUBS accomplishes this task in about 5 hours, a naive
algorithm that looks at the whole vocabulary would take more
than 6 days on a typical 2012 workstation.
4 Co-occurrence Data Embedding
The general strategy we follow for unsupervised
syntactic category acquisition is to combine features
of the context with the identity and features of the
target word. Our preliminary experiments indicated
that using the context information alone (e.g. clus-
tering substitute vectors) without the target word
identity and features had limited success.2 It is the
co-occurrence of a target word with a particular type
of context that best predicts the syntactic category.
In this section we review the unsupervised meth-
ods we used to model co-occurrence statistics: the
Co-occurrence Data Embedding (CODE) method
(Globerson et al 2007) and its spherical extension
(S-CODE) introduced by (Maron et al 2010).
Let X and Y be two categorical variables with fi-
nite cardinalities |X| and |Y |. We observe a set of
pairs {xi, yi}ni=1 drawn IID from the joint distribu-
tion of X and Y . The basic idea behind CODE and
related methods is to represent (embed) each value
of X and each value of Y as points in a common
low dimensional Euclidean space Rd such that val-
ues that frequently co-occur lie close to each other.
There are several ways to formalize the relationship
between the distances and co-occurrence statistics,
in this paper we use the following:
p(x, y) =
1
Z
p?(x)p?(y)e?d
2
x,y (4)
where d2x,y is the squared distance between the em-
beddings of x and y, p?(x) and p?(y) are empirical
probabilities, and Z =
?
x,y p?(x)p?(y)e
?d2x,y is a
normalization term. If we use the notation ?x for
the point corresponding to x and ?y for the point
corresponding to y then d2x,y = ??x ? ?y?
2. The
log-likelihood of a given embedding `(?, ?) can be
2A 10-nearest-neighbor supervised baseline using cosine
distance between substitute vectors gives .7213 accuracy. Clus-
tering substitute vectors using various distance metrics and di-
mensionality reduction methods give results inferior to this up-
per bound.
944
expressed as:
`(?, ?) =
?
x,y
p?(x, y) log p(x, y) (5)
=
?
x,y
p?(x, y)(? logZ + log p?(x)p?(y)? d2x,y)
= ? logZ + const ?
?
x,y
p?(x, y)d2x,y
The likelihood is not convex in ? and ?. We use
gradient ascent to find an approximate solution for
a set of ?x, ?y that maximize the likelihood. The
gradient of the d2x,y term pulls neighbors closer in
proportion to the empirical joint probability:
?
??x
?
x,y
?p?(x, y)d2x,y =
?
y
2p?(x, y)(?y ? ?x)
(6)
The gradient of the Z term pushes neighbors apart
in proportion to the estimated joint probability:
?
??x
(? logZ) =
?
y
2p(x, y)(?x ? ?y) (7)
Thus the net effect is to pull pairs together if their
estimated probability is less than the empirical prob-
ability and to push them apart otherwise. The gradi-
ents with respect to ?y are similar.
S-CODE (Maron et al 2010) additionally re-
stricts all ?x and ?y to lie on the unit sphere. With
this restriction, Z stays around a fixed value dur-
ing gradient ascent. This allows S-CODE to sub-
stitute an approximate constant Z? in gradient calcu-
lations for the real Z for computational efficiency.
In our experiments, we used S-CODE with its sam-
pling based stochastic gradient ascent algorithm and
smoothly decreasing learning rate.
5 Experiments
In this section we present experiments that evaluate
substitute vectors as representations of word con-
text within the S-CODE framework. Section 5.1
replicates the bigram based S-CODE results from
(Maron et al 2010) as a baseline. The S-CODE
algorithm works with discrete inputs. The substi-
tute vectors as described in Section 3 are high di-
mensional and continuous. We experimented with
two approaches to use substitute vectors in a dis-
crete setting. Section 5.2 presents an algorithm that
partitions the high dimensional space of substitute
vectors into small neighborhoods and uses the par-
tition id as a discrete context representation. Sec-
tion 5.3 presents an even simpler model which pairs
each word with a random substitute. When the left-
word ? right-word pairs used in the bigram model
are replaced with word ? partition-id or word ? sub-
stitute pairs we see significant gains in accuracy.
These results support our running hypothesis that
paradigmatic features, i.e. potential substitutes of
a word, are better determiners of syntactic category
compared to left and right neighbors. Section 5.4
explores morphologic and orthographic features as
additional sources of information and its results im-
prove the state-of-the-art in the field of unsupervised
syntactic category acquisition.
Each experiment was repeated 10 times with dif-
ferent random seeds and the results are reported
with standard errors in parentheses or error bars in
graphs. Table 1 summarizes all the results reported
in this paper and the ones we cite from the literature.
5.1 Bigram model
In (Maron et al 2010) adjacent word pairs (bi-
grams) in the corpus are fed into the S-CODE algo-
rithm as X,Y samples. The algorithm uses stochas-
tic gradient ascent to find the ?x, ?y embeddings for
left and right words in these bigrams on a single 25-
dimensional sphere. At the end each word w in the
vocabulary ends up with two points on the sphere,
a ?w point representing the behavior of w as the
left word of a bigram and a ?w point representing
it as the right word. The two vectors for w are con-
catenated to create a 50-dimensional representation
at the end. These 50-dimensional vectors are clus-
tered using an instance weighted k-means algorithm
and the resulting groups are compared to the cor-
rect part-of-speech tags. Maron et al(2010) report
many-to-one scores of .6880 (.0016) for 45 clusters
and .7150 (.0060) for 50 clusters (on the full PTB45
tag-set). If only ?w vectors are clustered without
concatenation we found the performance drops sig-
nificantly to about .62.
To make a meaningful comparison we re-ran the
bigram experiments using our default settings and
obtained a many-to-one score of .7314 (.0096) and
the V-measure is .6558 (.0052) for 45 clusters. The

5.2 Random partitions
Instead of using left-word ? right-word pairs as in-
puts to S-CODE we wanted to pair each word with a
paradigmatic representation of its context to get a di-
rect comparison of the two context representations.
To obtain a discrete representation of the context,
the random?partitions algorithm first designates a
random subset of substitute vectors as centroids to
partition the space, and then associates each context
with the partition defined by the closest centroid in
cosine distance. Each partition thus defined gets a
unique id, and word (X) ? partition-id (Y ) pairs are
given to S-CODE as input. The algorithm cycles
through the data until we get approximately 50 mil-
lion updates. The resulting ?x vectors are clustered
using the k-means algorithm (no vector concatena-
tion is necessary). Using default settings (64K ran-
dom partitions, 25 s-code dimensions, Z = 0.166)
the many-to-one accuracy is .7554 (.0055) and the
V-measure is .6703 (.0037).
To analyze the sensitivity of this result to our spe-
cific parameter settings we ran a number of experi-
ments where each parameter was varied over a range
of values.

can be varied within two orders of magnitude with-

experiments where we tested we found the real Z al-
ways to be in the 0.140-0.170 range. When the con-
stant Z? estimate is too small the attraction in Eq. 6
dominates the repulsion in Eq. 7 and all points tend
to converge to the same location. When Z? is too
high, it prevents meaningful clusters from coalesc-

We find the random partition algorithm to be
fairly robust to different parameter settings and the
resulting many-to-one score significantly better than
the bigram baseline.
5.3 Random substitutes
Another way to use substitute vectors in a dis-
crete setting is simply to sample individual substi-
tute words from them. The random-substitutes al-
gorithm cycles through the test data and pairs each
word with a random substitute picked from the pre-
computed substitute vectors (see Section 3). We ran
the random-substitutes algorithm to generate 14 mil-
lion word (X) ? random-substitute (Y ) pairs (12
substitutes for each token) as input to S-CODE.
Clustering the resulting ?x vectors yields a many-
to-one score of .7680 (.0038) and a V-measure of
.6822 (.0029).
This result is close to the previous result by the
random-partition algorithm, .7554 (.0055), demon-
strating that two very different discrete represen-
tations of context based on paradigmatic features
give consistent results. Both results are significantly
above the bigram baseline, .7314 (.0096). Figure 5
illustrates that the random-substitute result is fairly
robust as long as the training algorithm can observe
more than a few random substitutes per word.

5.4 Morphological and orthographic features
Clark (2003) demonstrates that using morpholog-
ical and orthographic features significantly im-
proves part-of-speech induction with an HMM
based model. Section 2 describes a number other ap-
proaches that show similar improvements. This sec-
tion describes one way to integrate additional fea-
tures to the random-substitute model.
The orthographic features we used are similar to
the ones in (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al 2010) with small
modifications:
? Initial-Capital: this feature is generated for cap-
italized words with the exception of sentence
initial words.
? Number: this feature is generated when the to-
ken starts with a digit.
? Contains-Hyphen: this feature is generated for
lowercase words with an internal hyphen.
947
? Initial-Apostrophe: this feature is generated for
tokens that start with an apostrophe.
We generated morphological features using the
unsupervised algorithm Morfessor (Creutz and La-
gus, 2005). Morfessor was trained on the WSJ sec-
tion of the Penn Treebank using default settings, and
a perplexity threshold of 300. The program induced
5 suffix types that are present in a total of 10,484
word types. These suffixes were input to S-CODE
as morphological features whenever the associated
word types were sampled.
In order to incorporate morphological and ortho-
graphic features into S-CODE we modified its in-
put. For each word ? random-substitute pair gen-
erated as in the previous section, we added word ?
feature pairs to the input for each morphological and
orthographic feature of the word. Words on average
have 0.25 features associated with them. This in-
creased the number of pairs input to S-CODE from
14.1 million (12 substitutes per word) to 17.7 mil-
lion (additional 0.25 features on average for each of
the 14.1 million words).
Using similar training settings as the previous
section, the addition of morphological and ortho-
graphic features increased the many-to-one score of
the random-substitute model to .8023 (.0070) and
V-measure to .7207 (.0041). Both these results im-
prove the state-of-the-art in part-of-speech induction
significantly as seen in Table 1.
6 Error Analysis
Figure 6 is the Hinton diagram showing the rela-
tionship between the most frequent tags and clusters
from the experiment in Section 5.4. In general the
errors seem to be the lack of completeness (multi-
ple large entries in a row), rather than lack of ho-
mogeneity (multiple large entries in a column). The
algorithm tends to split large word classes into sev-
eral clusters. Some examples are:
? Titles like Mr., Mrs., and Dr. are split from the
rest of the proper nouns in cluster (39).
? Auxiliary verbs (10) and the verb ?say? (22)
have been split from the general verb clusters
(12) and (7).
? Determiners ?the? (40), ?a? (15), and capital-
ized ?The?, ?A? (6) have been split into their
own clusters.
? Prepositions ?of? (19), and ?by?, ?at? (17) have
been split from the general preposition cluster
(8).
Nevertheless there are some homogeneity errors as
well:
? The adjective cluster (5) also has some noun
members probably due to the difficulty of sep-
arating noun-noun compounds from adjective
modification.
? Cluster (6) contains capitalized words that span
a number of categories.
Most closed-class items are cleanly separated into
their own clusters as seen in the lower right hand
corner of the diagram. The completeness errors are
not surprising given that the words that have been
split are not generally substitutable with the other
members of their Penn Treebank category. Thus it
can be argued that metrics that emphasize homo-
geneity such as MTO are more appropriate in this
context than metrics that average homogeneity and
completeness such as VM as long as the number of
clusters is controlled.
7 Contributions
Our main contributions can be summarized as fol-
lows:
? We introduced substitute vectors as paradig-
matic representations of word context and
demonstrated their use in syntactic category ac-
quisition.
? We demonstrated that using paradigmatic rep-
resentations of word context and modeling co-
occurrences of word and context types with
the S-CODE learning framework give superior
results when compared to a baseline bigram
model.
? We extended the S-CODE framework to in-
corporate morphological and orthographic fea-
tures and improved the state-of-the-art in un-
supervised part-of-speech induction to 80%
many-to-one accuracy.

Abstract
Word sense induction aims to discover differ-
ent senses of a word from a corpus by us-
ing unsupervised learning approaches. Once a
sense inventory is obtained for an ambiguous
word, word sense discrimination approaches
choose the best-fitting single sense for a given
context from the induced sense inventory.
However, there may not be a clear distinction
between one sense and another, although for
a context, more than one induced sense can
be suitable. Graded word sense method al-
lows for labeling a word in more than one
sense. In contrast to the most common ap-
proach which is to apply clustering or graph
partitioning on a representation of first or sec-
ond order co-occurrences of a word, we pro-
pose a system that creates a substitute vec-
tor for each target word from the most likely
substitutes suggested by a statistical language
model. Word samples are then taken accord-
ing to probabilities of these substitutes and the
results of the co-occurrence model are clus-
tered. This approach outperforms the other
systems on graded word sense induction task
in SemEval-2013.
1 Introduction
There exists several drawbacks of representing the
word senses with a fixed-list of definitions of a man-
ually constructed lexical database. There is no guar-
antee that they reflect the exact meaning of a tar-
get word in a given context since they usually con-
tain definitions that are too general (Ve?ronis, 2004).
More so, lexical databases often include many rare
senses while missing corpus/domain-specific senses
(Pantel and Lin, 2004). The goal of Word Sense In-
duction (WSI) is to solve these problems by auto-
matically discovering the meanings of a target word
from a text, not pre-defined sense inventories. Word
Sense Discrimination (WSD) approaches determine
best-fitting sense among the meanings that are dis-
covered for an ambiguous word. However, (Erk
et al, 2009) suggested that annotators often gave
high ratings to more than one WordNet sense for the
same occurrence. They introduced a novel annota-
tion paradigm allowing that words have more than
one sense with a degree of applicability.
Unlike previous SemEval tasks in which systems
labeled a target word?s meaning with only one sense,
word sense induction task in SemEval-2013 relaxes
this by allowing a target word to have more than one
sense if applicable.
Word sense induction approaches can be catego-
rized into graph based models, bayesian, and vector-
space ones. In graph-based approaches, every con-
text word is represented as a vertex and if two con-
text words co-occur in one or more instances of a
target word, then two vertices are connected with
an edge. When the graph is obtained, one of the
graph clustering algorithm is employed. As a result,
different partitions indicate the different senses of a
target word (Ve?ronis, 2004). Agirre et al (2006) ex-
plored the use of two graph algorithms for unsuper-
vised induction and tagging of nominal word senses
based on corpora. Recently, Korkontzelos and Man-
andhar (2010) proposed a graph-based model which
achieved good results on word sense induction and
discrimination task in SemEval-2010.
300
Brody and Lapata (2009) proposed a Bayesian
approach modeling the contexts of the ambiguous
word as samples from a multinomial distribution
over senses which are in turn characterized as dis-
tributions over words.
Vector-space models, on the other hand, typically
create context vector by using first or second or-
der co-occurrences. Once context vector has been
constructed, different clustering algorithms may be
applied. However, representing the context with
first or second order co-occurrences can be difficult
since there are plenty of parameters to be consid-
ered such as the order of occurrence, context win-
dow size, statistical significance of words in the con-
text window and so on. Instead of dealing with
these, we suggest representing the context with the
most likely substitutes determined by a statistical
language model. Statistical language models based
on large corpora has been examined in (Yuret, 2007;
Hawker, 2007; Yuret and Yatbaz, 2010) for unsuper-
vised word sense disambiguation and lexical substi-
tution. Moreover, the best results in unsupervised
part-of-speech induction achieved by using substi-
tute vectors (Yatbaz et al, 2012).
In this paper, we propose a system that represents
the context of each target word by using high prob-
ability substitutes according to a statistical language
model. These substitute words and their probabili-
ties are used to create word pairs (instance id - sub-
stitute word) to feed our co-occurrence model. The
output of the co-occurrence model is clustered by k-
means algorithm. Our systems perform well among
other submitted systems in SemEval-2013.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the provided datasets and evalu-
ation measures of the task. Section 3 gives de-
tails of our algorithm and is divided into five con-
tiguous subsections that correspond to each step of
our system. In Section 4 we present the differ-
ences between our three systems and their perfor-
mances. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our work in
this task. The code to replicate this work is available
at http://goo.gl/jPTZQ.
2 Data and Evaluation Methodology
The test data for the graded word sense induction
task in SemEval-2013 includes 50 terms containing
20 verbs, 20 nouns and 10 adjectives. There are a
total of 4664 test instances provided. All evalua-
tion was performed on test instances only. In ad-
dition, the organizers provided sense labeled trial
data which can be used for tuning. This trial data
is a redistribution of the Graded Sense and Usage
data set provided by Katrin Erk, Diana McCarthy,
and Nicholas Gaylord (Erk et al, 2009). It consists
of 8 terms; 3 verbs, 3 nouns, and 2 adjectives all
with moderate polysemy (4-7 senses). Each term
in trial data has 50 contexts, in total 400 instances
provided. Lastly, participants can use ukWaC1, a 2-
billion word web-gathered corpus, for sense induc-
tion. Furthermore, unlike in previous WSI tasks, or-
ganizers allow participants to use additional contexts
not found in the ukWaC under the condition that they
submit systems for both using only the ukWaC and
with their augmented corpora.
The gold-standard of test data was prepared using
WordNet 3.1 by 10 annotators. Since WSI systems
report their annotations in a different sense inven-
tory than WordNet 3.1, a mapping procedure should
be used first. The organizers use the sense mapping
procedure explained in (Jurgens, 2012). This proce-
dure has adopted the supervised evaluation setting
of past SemEval WSI Tasks, but the main differ-
ence is that the former takes into account applica-
bility weights for each sense which is a necessary
for graded word sense.
Evaluation can be divided into two categories: (1)
a traditional WSD task for Unsupervised WSD and
WSI systems, (2) a clustering comparison setting
that evaluates the similarity of the sense inventories
for WSI systems. WSD evaluation is made accord-
ing to three objectives:
? Their ability to detect which senses are appli-
cable (Jaccard Index is used)
? Their ability to rank the applicable senses ac-
cording to the level of applicability (Weighted
Kendall?s ? is used)
? Their ability to quantify the level of applicabil-
ity for each sense (Weighted Normalized Dis-
counted Cumulative Gain is used)
Clustering comparison is made by using:

? Fuzzy Normalized Mutual Information: It cap-
tures the alignment of the two clusterings inde-
pendent of the cluster sizes and therefore serves
as an effective measure of the ability of an ap-
proach to accurately model rare senses.
? Fuzzy B-Cubed: It provides an item-based
evaluation that is sensitive to the cluster size
skew and effectively captures the expected per-
formance of the system on a dataset where the
cluster (i.e., sense) distribution would be equiv-
alent.

3 Algorithm
In this section, we explain our algorithm. First, we
describe data enrichment procedure then we will an-
swer how each instance?s substitute vector was con-
structed. In contrast to common practice which is
clustering the context directly, we first performed
word sampling on the substitute vectors and cre-
ated instance id - substitute word pairs as explained
in Subsection 3.3. These pairs were used in the
co-occurrence modeling step described in Subsec-
tion 3.4. Finally, we clustered these co-occurrence
modeling output with the k-means clustering algo-
rithm. It is worth noting that this pipeline is per-
formed on each target word separately.
SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) is employed on entire
ukWaC corpus for the 4-gram language model to
conduct all experiments.
3.1 Data Enrichment
Data enrichment aims to increase the number of in-
stances of target words. Our preliminary experi-
ments on the trial data showed that additional con-
texts increase the performance of our systems.
Assuming that our target word is book in noun
form. We randomly fetch 20,000 additional contexts
from ukWaC where our target word occurs with the
same part-of-speech tag. This implies that we skip
those sentences in which the word book functions as
a verb. These additional contexts are labeled with
unique numbers so that we can distinguish actual in-
stances in the test data. We follow this procedure for

Table 1: The most likely substitutes for meet
every target word in the test data. In total, 1 mil-
lion additional instances were fetched from ukWac.
Hereafter we refer to this new dataset with as an ex-
panded dataset.
3.2 Substitute Vectors
Unlike other WSI methods which rely on the first or
the second order co-occurrences (Pedersen, 2010),
we represent the context of each target word instance
by finding the most likely substitutes suggested by
the 4-gram language model we built from ukWaC
corpus. The high probability substitutes reflect both
semantic and syntactic properties of the context as
seen in Table 1 for the following example:
And we need Your help to meet the chal-
lenge!
For every instance in our expanded dataset, we
use three tokens each on the left and the right side of
a target word as a context when estimating the prob-
abilities for potential lexical substitutes. This tight
window size might seem limited, however, tight con-
text windows give better scores for semantic simi-
larity, while larger context windows or second-order
context words are better for modeling general top-
ical relatedness (Sahlgren, 2006; Peirsman et al,
2008).
Fastsubs (Yuret, 2012) was used for this process
and the top 100 most likely substitutes were used for
representing each instance since the rest of the sub-
stitutes had negligible probabilities. These top 100
probabilities were normalized to add up to 1.0 giv-
ing us a final substitute vector for a particular target
word?s instance. Note that the substitute vector is a

function of the context only and is indifferent to the
target word.
At the end of this step, we had 1,004,466 sub-
stitute vectors. The next common step might be to
cluster these vectors either locally, which means ev-
ery target word will be clustered separately; or glob-
ally, which indicates all instances (approximately 1
million) will be clustered together. Both approaches
led us to lower scores than the presented method.
Therefore, instead of clustering substitute vectors di-
rectly, we relied on co-occurrence modeling.
3.3 Substitute Word Sampling
Before running S-CODE (Maron et al, 2010) to
model co-occurrence statistics, we needed to per-
form the substitute word sampling. For each target
word?s instance, we sample 100 substitutes from its
substitute vector. Assuming that our target word is
meet and its substitute vector is the one shown in
Instance ID Substitute Word

Table 3: Substitute sampling for a target word meet.
Instance ID - Substitute word pairs
Table 1. We choose 100 substitutes from this in-
stance?s substitute vector by using individual proba-
bilities of substitutes. As seen in Table 2, those sub-
stitutes which have high probabilities dominate the
right column. Recall that Table 2 illustrates only one
instance (subscript denotes the instance number) for
the target word meet which has 20,000 and 100 in-
stances from the context enrichment procedure and
the test, respectively. We followed the same proce-
dure for every instance of each target word. Table 3
depicts instance id - substitute word pairs for the
target word meet rather than for only one instance
shown in Table 2.
3.4 Co-Occurrence Modeling
After sampling, we had approximately 20,000 in-
stance id - substitute word pairs. These pairs were
used to feed S-CODE. The premise is that words
with similar meanings will occur in similar contexts
(Harris, 1954), and at the end this procedure enables
us to put together words with similar meanings as
well as making the clustering procedure more accu-
rate. If two different instances have similar substi-
tute word pairs (i.e, similar contexts) then these two
word pairs attract each other and they will be located
closely on the unit sphere, otherwise they will repel
and eventually be far away from each other (see Fig-
ure 1).
3.5 Clustering
We used k-means clustering on S-CODE sphere.
Note that the procedures explained in the fore-
gone subsections were repeated for each target

word. More precisely, the substitute sampling, co-
occurrence modeling and clustering were performed
one by one for each target word.
We picked 22 as k value since the test set con-
tained words with 3 to 22 senses. After all word
pairs were labeled, we counted all class labels for
each instance in the test set. For example, if meet1?s
50 word pairs are labeled with c1 and 30 word pairs
are labeled with c2 and finally 20 word pairs are la-
beled with c3, then this particular instance would
have 50% sense1, 30% sense2 and 20% sense3.
4 Evaluation Results
In this section, we will discuss evaluation scores and
the characteristics of the test and the trial data.
All three AI-KU systems followed the same pro-
cedures described in Section 3. After clustering,
some basic post-processing operations were per-
formed for ai-ku(a1000) and ai-ku(r5-a1000). For
ai-ku(a1000), we added 1000 to all sense labels
which were obtained from the clustering procedure;
for ai-ku(r5-a1000), those sense labels occurred less
than 5 times in clustering were removed since we
considered them to be unreliable labels, afterwards
we added 1000 for all remaining sense labels.

mance of our systems on the test data using all

better scores than all participants. More precisely,
on sense detection objective, MFS baseline obtained
0.552 which is the top score, while the best submit-
ted system could reach only 0.244. Why is it the case
that MFS had one of the worst sense detection score
on trial data (see Table 4), but best on test data? Un-
like the trial data, test data largely consists of only
one sense instances, MFS usually gives correct an-
swer. Table 6 illustrates the characteristics of the
test and trial data. Instances annotated with multiple
sense had a very small fraction in the test data. In
fact, 517 instances in the test set were annotated with
two senses (11%) and only 25 were annotated with
three senses (0.5%). However, trial data provided
by the organizers had almost 5 senses per instance
on the average. A similar results can be observed
in All-Senses baselines. On sense ranking objec-

tives, All-Sense-eq-weighted outperformed all other
systems. The reason is the same as the above. This
baseline ranks all senses equally and since most in-
stances had been annotated only one sense, the other
wrong senses were tied and placed at the second po-
sition in ranking. As a result, this baseline achieved
the highest score. Finally, for quantifying the level
of applicability for each sense, Weighted NDCG was
employed. ai-ku outperformed other submitted sys-
tems, but top score was achieved by all-sense-avg-
weighted baseline. Addition to these results, orga-
nizers provided scores for instances which have only
one sense. This setting contains 89% of the test data.
Table 7 shows supervised and unsupervised scores
for all single-sense instances. Our base system, ai-
ku, outperformed all other system and all baselines
for FScore. Moreover, it also achieved the second
best score (0.045) for Fuzzy NMI. Only one base-
line (one sense per instance) obtained slightly better
score (0.048) for this metric. For Fuzzy B-Cubed,
ai-ku(r5-a1000) obtained 0.421 which is the third
best score.
Clustering Comparison: This evaluation setting
aims to measure the similarity of the induced sense
inventories for WSI systems. Unlike supervised
metrics, it avoids potential loss of sense information

formance of our systems, best and worst systems as
well as the random baselines.
The best scores for the graded word sense in-
duction task in SemEval-2013 are mostly achieved
by baselines in supervised setting. Major problem
is that there is huge sense differences between test
and trial data regarding to number of sense distribu-
tion. Participants that used trial data as for param-
eter tuning and picking the best algorithm achieved
lower scores than baselines since test data does not
show properties of trial data. Consequently, ai-ku
systems produce significantly more senses than the
gold-standard (see Table 9), and this mainly deterio-
rates our performance.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented substitute vector repre-
sentation and co-occurrence modeling on WSI task.
Clustering substitute vectors directly gives lower
scores. Thus, taking samples from each target?s sub-
stitute vector, we obtained instance id - substitute
word pairs. These pairs were used by S-CODE. Fi-
305
nally we run k-means on the S-CODE. Although our
systems were highly ranked among the other submit-
ted systems, no system showed better performance
than the top baselines for all metrics. One explana-
tion is that trial data does not reflect the characteris-
tics of test data according to their number of sense
distributions. Systems used trial data biased to re-
turn more than one sense for each instance since av-
erage number of sense is almost five in trial data. In
addition, baselines (except random ones) know true
sense distribution in the test data beforehand which
make them harder to beat.
