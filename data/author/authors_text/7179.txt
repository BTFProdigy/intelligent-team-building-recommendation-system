Abstract 
This paper demonstrates that the polysemy of 
the verb grow is a result of natural extension 
of individual meanings connoted by its basic 
literal meaning and that the polysemy of grow, 
as such, can be disambiguated by applying 
simple rules of elimination to the argument 
structures, which are the contexts that make 
particular senses viable. 
1 Introduction1 
This paper claims that the polysemy of the verb 
grow is a result of natural extension of meanings 
connoted by the basic literal meaning and that the 
connotations develop into each independent mean-
ing of grow by requiring different semantic fea-
tures of the arguments. The connotations of the 
literal meaning of grow become viable in a new 
context of argument structure. 
 
It will be demonstrated that for the computational 
treatment of disambiguation, it is not necessary to 
exhaust all the features involved in a particular 
meaning of grow, but the application of simple 
rules of elimination to the argument structure 
would be sufficient. 
                                                          
1 I would like to thank Alan Wallington, John Barnde, Mark 
Lee and Sheila Glasbey for organizing the workshop entitled 
The Lexicon and Figurative Language at ACL 2003 in Sap-
poro, Japan on July 11, 2003. My thanks also go to three 
anonymous reviewers for valuable comments. I alone, how-
ever, am responsible for any errors this paper may contain. 
 
The second section will discuss each sense of grow, 
focusing on the semantic components of the argu-
ments, and on the relationships among them. I will 
demonstrate what is required to disambiguate the 
polysemy of grow in the third section, which is 
followed by short sections for implications and 
conclusion. 
2 Relationships of extended meanings 
Viewed by using such thematic roles of verbs as 
GOAL and SOURCE, the meanings of the verb 
grow shows an interesting relationship among each 
other. According to the etymology of the word, the 
original sense would be for a plant to germinate 
and develop or for a living thing to undergo natural 
development, for instance, by increasing in size 
and changing physically. The meanings of grow 
could be illustrated as below2: 
 
(1) grow_proto 
 
a. It?s too cold for orchids to grow here. 
b. Crocuses don't grow in ponds. 
c. Later, forests grew on the delta. 
                                                          
2 The following idiomatic uses of grow are not included in the 
discussion of this paper: 
(i)  His new jacket?s a bit big for him now, but he?ll soon grow 
into it. 
(ii) I didn?t like blue cheese at first, but the taste has kind of 
grown on me. 
(iii) Jonathan still sucks his thumb, but we hope he?ll grow out 
of it. 
(iv) What will you be when you grow up? 
d. A dozen or so bushes grew from a wide fis-
sure. 
e. He grew mentally and spiritually.3 
 
(2) grow_appear 
 
a. A small glimmer of happiness grew on their 
faces. 
b. Confidence grew in him. 
c. Their love grew out of friendship. 
d. The book grew out of their weekly meetings. 
e. In those days such interests rarely grew from 
the pupils? enthusiasm or choice. 
 
(3) grow_increase 
 
a. His confidence grew. 
b. He grew in confidence. 
c. The city?s population grew from 130,000 to 
more than 500,000.  
d. The ethnic minorities grew in influence. 
e. The European market for ISDN telephone 
lines will grow in value from ?200,000 
now to ?2.5m by the year 2000. 
 
(4) grow_change 
 
a. A boy grows to manhood. 
b. A boy grows into a man. 
c. His love grew cold 
d. I am growing to hate him. 
e. They grew from girl to woman. 
f. The city of London grew from a small fish-
ing village to a great city. 
 
 (5) grow_caused 
 
a. The farmer grew corn in this field last year. 
b. He?s growing a beard. 
c. Plants grow roots. 
d. Cattle often grow horns. 
 
A.  grow_proto and grow_appear 
 
The meaning of ?grow_proto? connotes a combina-
tion of appearance, development, increase in size 
and change, all of which seem to have developed 
to be independent meanings of grow through the 
                                                          
3 He grew mentally and spiritually in (1e) may be a result of 
personification. 
metaphorical process. Therefore, each developed 
meaning has the undertone of the basic meaning of 
grow. 
 
The characteristic properties of the meaning of 
?grow_proto? are that the SUBJECT noun phrase 
refers to a living thing such as a plant and a human 
and that it may take a component that plays a role 
of denoting place for both growing and existence. 
Such a component is called LOCUS among such 
scholars who study the semantic structure of verbs 
as Gruber (1965), Starosta (1978) and Ostler 
(1980)4. 
 
Unlike the meaning of ?grow_proto?, the meaning 
of ?grow_appear? takes the SUBJECT noun phrase 
that does not refer to a living thing. Therefore, the 
meanings of ?grow_proto? and ?grow_appear? are 
complementary in terms of the  features of the 
SUBJECT noun phrases. In addition, unlike the 
reading of ?grow_proto?, the reading of 
?grow_appear? does not necessarily require a  
LOCUS component having the feature of PLACE, 
but the feature of denoting a physical object such 
as a face in (2a) would be sufficient. Thus, it could 
be stated that the reading of ?grow_appear? has less 
semantic constraint on the LOCUS component 
than that of ?grow_proto?.  
 
In addition, the reading of ?grow_appear? takes a 
component indicating source of coming into exis-
tence, which can be called SOURCE because of 
the role of indicating the source of action. The 
SOURCE element refers to an abstract entity as in 
(2c) through (2e). Difference in the semantic fea-
tures of the components in the readings of 
?grow_proto? and ?grow_appear? is illustrated in 
the following table: 
 
                                                          
4 It should be noted that LOCUS should be distinguished from 
LOCATION, which indicates place where AGENT takes ac-
tion. Take the following for instance: 
  a. He is writing a letter on a letter pad. 
  b. He is writing a letter in the kitchen. 
The phrase on a letter pad functions as LOCUS whereas in the 
kitchen,  LOCATION.

grow_appear non-living

Although both readings take the construction in the 
form of SUBJECT + GROW + LOCUS, the read-
ing of ?grow_appear? needs either the LOCUS or 
the SOURCE whereas the reading of ?grow_proto? 
can have the SUBJECT only. 
 
B.  grow_increase 
 
The SUBJECT noun phrase of the reading of 
?grow_increase? refers either to a physical object 
or to an abstract object. This reading permits an 
interesting interchange of  two constructions, as 
illustrated below: 
 
(7)  
 a. His confidence grew.  (= 3a) 
  (POSSESSOR?s ATTRIBUTE GROW) 
 
 b. He grew in confidence. (= 3b) 
 (POSSESSOR GROW in ATTRIBUTE) 
 
As (7b) shows, the POSSESSOR component can 
be the SUBJECT of the sentence, and the 
ATTRIBUTE can appear in the form of in + 
ATTRIBUTE. Let us look into the phrase in confi-
dence in (7b). In fact, we find the third construc-
tion somewhat similar in meaning to those in (7a) 
and (7b), which is repeated below: 
 
(8)  Confidence grew in him. (= 2b) 
 
Let us use the following conceptual diagrams for 
our exploration of the nature of the phrase ?in + 
ATTRIBUTE?: 
                                                          
5 Parentheses indicate the item inside is optional. 
 
(9)  
  a. A flower grew in the pot. 
 b. Confidence grew in him. (= 2b, 8) 
 c. He grew in confidence. (=3b, 7b) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The two diagrams suggest that in (9a) the part, a 
flower, is the SUBJECT of the sentence, and the 
whole, the pot,  is the LOCUS. Likewise, in (9b) 
the part, confidence, is the SUBJECT while the 
whole, him, is the LOCUS. Alternatively, by using 
Talmy?s (1978) terminology in cognitive psychol-
ogy, we could call the part ?figure? and the whole 
?ground?. Moreover, Brugman and Lakoff (1988) 
treated the figure as an element in focus and the 
ground as an element not in focus in the paper 
dealing with prepositions. Drawing on the insight 
of previous researchers, I call the thematic role of 
the phrase in confidence FOCUS. The FOCUS 
element in this construction always appears in the 
form of in + FOCUS noun, and the noun refers to 
an abstract entity.  
 
Furthermore, the reading of ?grow_increase? may 
appear with phrases indicating a finishing point of 
increase as well as a starting point. As those 
phrases are preceded by the prepositions to and 
from, I call their thematic roles GOAL and 
SOURCE respectively according to the naming 
convention of thematic roles. As the examples in 
(3c) and (3e) show, the GOAL and SOURCE ele-
ments denote quantities. It should also be noted 
that the reading of ?grow_increase? does not take 
the SOURCE element alone without accompany-
ing the GOAL element. Where there is a SOURCE 
element, so is there a GOAL element.

Thus, we need three-fold constructions in this read-
ing, as illustrated below;

C.  grow_change 
 
The reading of ?grow_change? seems to derive by 
focusing the aspect of change or development con-
noted by the basic meaning of grow. The 
SUBJECT noun phrase refers to an entity that un-
dergoes change of state. The minimum require-
ment of this reading is an element that indicates the 
final state of change whether the final state is ex-
pressed as a prepositional phrase as in to manhood 
(4a) and into a man (4b), as an adjective as in grew 
cold (4c), or as an infinitival phrase as in growing 
to hate him (4d). This reading may optionally ap-
pear with an element denoting the initial state of 
change, as in from girl to woman in (4e).  
 
                                                          
6 Parentheses indicate the item inside is optional. 
The characteristics of this reading is that the se-
mantic features in the SUBJECT, GOAL and, if 
any, SOURCE elements should agree in feature 
specification. For instance, in (4b) the semantic 
features of boy and man should agree in feature 
specification for well-formedness. It is easy to de-
tect some cases of this reading syntactically. Only 
this reading permits such a construction as His love 
grew cold in (4c) and I am growing to hate him in 
(4d). The following table shows semantic features 
for the reading of ?grow_change? in constructions 
other than (4c) and (4d), both of which require a 
special syntactic treatment.

quired ele-
ment)

tional element)

D.  grow_caused 
 
The reading of ?grow_caused? differs structurally 
from the other readings discussed above in that it 
requires the component which plays the grammati-
cal role of OBJECT. In other words, grow in this 
reading is a transitive verb. This reading is derived 
from the reading of ?grow_proto? by adding the 
AGENT element, and thus it may take the LOCUS 
element, as in grew corn in this field (5a). Thus it 
is not difficult to distinguish this reading from the 
other readings. 
 
To sum up, a combination of connotations of the 
literal meaning of ?grow_proto? each seems to be-
come a focus and develop into an independent 
meaning of grow. The shift of focus has caused the 
change of the semantics of the argument, resulting 
in a different argument structure from that for the 
basic meanig: for instance, the meaning of increase 
does not take the LOCUS that denotes place any 
longer, but can instead have a FOCUS element that 
denotes an abstract entity. Likewise, the GOAL 
and SOURCE elements in the reading of 
?grow_increase? do not denote place, but indicate a 
finishing and a starting points of increase respec-
tively. The reading of ?grow_change? may have 
GOAL and SOURCE elements, but what they 
really represent is the final and initial states of 
change. Yet, the readings of ?grow_increase? and 
?grow_change? are related to each other, and share 
something in common: both events are realized by 
growing. All extended meanings carry the under-
tone of the basic meaning with them. These mean-
ings seem to be developed from ?grow_proto? as if 
cell division takes place. This kind of lexical or-
ganization and extension would reduce memory 
load on the learner.  
 
3 For computational treatment 
Finally, I would like to make comments on the 
computational treatment of the polysemy of grow. 
The following table gives an idea of which read-
ings are similar syntactically and semantically and 
of what is required to disambiguate the polysemy. 
For the computational treatment of disambiguation, 
we would not need to exhaust all the features in-
volved in argument structure for each meaning of a 
verb, but to have sufficient rules of elimination of 
other readings would suffice. 
 
Following is a table showing relationships among 
the meanings of grow, which is organized in terms 
of grammatical and thematic roles.7 
 
(12) 
 
Meanings Just 
SUBJ 
L G G&S S 
grow_proto ok ok   ok 
grow_appear  ok   ok

L=LOCUS, F=FOCUS, G=GOAL, G&S = GOAL

7 I will not include the reading of ?grow_caused? because it 
has a distintive construction by having the OBJECT, and is 
easy to distinguish from the others. In addition, constructions 
such as His love grew cold and I am growing to hate him are 
not included in this table because these are typical of the rea d-
ing of ?grow_change?, and are easy to detect syntact ically. 
8 ?=F? means that in this reading the LOCUS element has a 
more specific role, FOCUS. 
The construction in the form of SUBJECT + 
GROW appears in both readings of ?grow_proto? 
and ?grow_increase?. Both readings are distin-
guishable from each other by the semantics of the 
SUBJECT noun phrases. The SUBJECT noun 
phrase in the reading of ?grow_proto? requires an 
entity referring to a living thing, while that in the 
reading of ?grow_increase?, an abstract entity. 
 
Three readings, ?grow_proto?, ?grow_appear? and 
?grow_increase? take the form of SUBJECT noun 
phrase + GROW + P9 + LOCUS noun phrase; in 
particular the last reading in the form of SUBJECT 
+ GROW + in + FOCUS noun instead. As the 
LOCUS in the reading of ?grow_proto? denotes the 
PLACE feature and the others do not, the reading 
of ?grow_proto? can be distinguished from the 
other two. Between the remaining two, the reading 
of ?grow_appear? takes the LOCUS requiring a 
physical entity whereas the reading of 
?grow_increase?, an abstract entity. 
 
The readings of ?grow_incease? and 
?grow_change? may appear in the form of 
SUBJECT + GROW + to + GOAL or in the form 
of SUBJECT + GROW + from + SOURCE + to + 
GOAL. They are distinguishable because the 
GOAL and SOURCE in the reading of 
?grow_increase? include features of QUANTITY 
while those in the reading of ?grow_change? do not. 
 
The readings of ?grow_proto? and ?grow_appear? 
take the form of SUBJECT + GROW + from + 
SOURCE, but while the SOURCE in the reading 
of ?grow_appear? refers to an abstract entity, that 
in the reading of ?grow_proto? does not. As men-
tioned above, the two readings are also distin-
guishable in terms of the semantic features of the 
SUBJECT noun phrases because the SUBJECT of 
the reading of ?grow_proto? requires a feature indi-
cating a living thing while that of the reading of 
?grow_appear? should not. 
 
As discussed above, once rules of elimination are 
prepared, it would not be difficult to disambiguate 
the polysemy of a word, because the polysemy is 
based on the extension of meanings that do not 
overlap and the contexts that make the extensions 
                                                          
9 ?P? stands for preposition. 
viable should not overlap either. The contexts in 
the case of verbs are the argument structures. 
4 Implications  
Interestingly, the hypothesis of the relationship 
between the primary sense and other extended 
senses in this study differs from that in Tyler and 
Evans? (2001) study on the polysemy of the prepo-
sition over. This study claims that the basic or pri-
mary sense of grow has a combination of 
individual connotations such as change of state, 
increase and appearance, and that grow acquires a 
new sense extended from each individual connota-
tion by allowing a different argument structure. On 
the other hand, the primary sense of over proposed 
in Tyler and Evans ?represents a highly idealized 
abstraction from our rich recurring experience of 
spatial scenes? and ?other distinct senses instanti-
ated in the polysemy network for over result from 
pragmatic strengthening, i.e. reanalysis and encod-
ing.? (p. 762) It would be an open question whether 
this difference is due to different subject matters, 
i.e. between the verb and the preposition, or due to 
different approaches, i.e. between computationally 
motivated and psycholinguistic approaches.  
 
However, both studies have a common underlying 
thesis that the lexicon is highly motivated exhibit-
ing regularities. This is in contrast to the view gen-
erally held by Minimalist linguists that the lexicon 
is not organized by general principles (Chomsky 
1995).10 
 
The advantage of the analysis of the polysemy of 
grow proposed in this study is that it is somewhat 
similar to analyses we find in the entries for grow 
in dictionaries. This suggests that it might be pos-
sible to use analyses of lexical entries listed in tr a-
ditional dictionaries for computational purposes. 
5 Conclusion  
This paper has discussed the relationships of the 
polysemy of the verb grow by examining the se-
                                                          
10 The study of the lexicon and in particular the semantic 
polysemy has never been a subject of serious linguistic r e-
search in the framework of Generative Linguistics. As the 
study of the lexicon has been scarce and the research has to 
cover a vast realm of linguistic data and activities, this field is 
in dire need of future research. 
mantic features of the arguments. It has demon-
strated that a combination of meanings connoted in 
the basic literal meaning each develops into an in-
dependent meaning of grow, attaining a new con-
text that makes the meanig effective. The 
polysemy of grow is a natural extension of conno-
tations of its basic meaning. This type of lexical 
organization, if this assumption is in the right di-
rection, would have reduced memory load on the 
learner. It has also pointed out that for the compu-
tational treatment of disambiguation, it is not nec-
essary to exhaust all the features involved in a 
particular reading of the polysemy, but that simple 
rules of elimination of other readings should suf-
fice. This claim has been demonstrated by disam-
biguating the polysemy of grow by applying the 
rules of elimination to the argument structures, 
which are in fact the contexts that make particular 
meanings viable.

Abstract 
This paper proposes two decision trees for de-
termining the meanings of the prepositional 
uses of over by using the contextual informa-
tion. It first examines the meanings of the 
prepositional uses of over and then aims at 
identifying the contexts for interpreting the 
meanings. Some contexts are complementary 
features, and that makes the decision trees sim-
ple. The trees have been tested on a corpus, and 
the results are encouraging. 
1 Introduction 
Prepositions have been studied from a variety of per-
spectives. The syntactic status has been probed by such 
linguists as Jackendoff [77], Emonds [85], Rauh [93] 
and Pullum and Huddleston [02]. Cognitive theorists 
have paid attention to the polysemous nature of preposi-
tions and explored the conceptual relationships of the 
polysemy, often proposing the graphical mental images 
(Lakoff and Johnson [80], Brugman [81, 88], Herskovits 
[86], Langacker [87], Tyler and Evans [01]). Pragmatic 
aspects of prepositions have been studied by such schol-
ars as Fauconnier [94] and Visetti and Cadiot [02]. The 
deictic properties of spatial prepositions have been ex-
amined by Hill [82], while the geographical information 
provided by them was an interest of computational re-
search (Xu and Badler [00], Tezuka et al[01]). A prac-
tical study of the usage of prepositions was carried out 
for the purpose of teaching English as a second lan-
guage (Wahlen [95], Lindstromberg [97], Yates [99]). 
In the fields related to natural language processing, 
prepositional phrase attachment has been a topic for 
research for quite a long time, and in recent years, the 
problem was explored with a neural network-based ap-
proach (Sopena, LLoberas and Moliner [98]) and with a 
syntax-based trainable approach (Yeh and Valin [98]). 
Although past research has revealed various aspects of 
prepositions, to my knowledge there is not much seman-
tic research of prepositions available for computational 
use, which requires a vigorous formalization of repre-
senting the semantics. 
A recent semantic study of prepositions for computa-
tional use is found in Voss [02], with a focus on spatial 
prepositions. Spatial prepositions are divided into three 
categories according to which one of the two thematic 
meanings between place and path they acquire when 
they are in argument, adjunct and non-subcategorized 
positions of particular types of verbs. The semantics of 
spatial prepositions dealt with in Voss [02] is not lexical 
but thematic. 
The present study places more focus on the lexical 
meanings of prepositions rather than on the thematic 
meanings because it is intended for use in machine 
translation (MT), where the meaning of a sentence, a 
phrase or a lexical entry of a source language must be 
preserved in the target language, even though it may 
take a different syntactic form in the source and target 
languages. The preservation of meaning is even more 
important at an Interlingua-based MT, because meaning 
is a medium of translation between source and target 
languages. 
The current research deals with the prepositional 
uses of over, but not with the uses of over in different 
syntactic categories such as the use as adjective (as in 
The initial test is over), as part of a phrasal verb (as in 
He handed over his notes to me), as part of an idiomatic 
phrase (as in She said it over and over) and as a modi-
fier of a quantity (as in  over forty years ago). These 
uses could be identified in terms of their syntactic char-
acteristics. On the other hand, the prepositional uses are 
grouped under the same syntactic category, but exhibit 
different meanings in different semantic contexts, re-
quiring semantic treatments as well for the disambigua-
tion of the senses. 
This paper examines the meanings of the preposi-
tional uses of over, identifies the semantic contexts, and 
proposes two decision trees for interpreting the different 
meanings. The second section will divide the preposi-
tional uses of over into two groups according to which 
one of the two functional units between Head and Com-
plement is likely to identity the meanings. It will also 
bring into light the semantic features of the Head and 
Complement components that make the interpretations 
of the uses possible. The third section will discusses the 
two decision trees proposed in this paper, and the fourth 
section gives an evaluation of the trees, before conclud-
ing this paper. 
2 Meanings of the prepositional uses

groups: those whose meaning is likely to be identified 
by the Complement noun phrases and those that need 
semantic information in the Head components. The 
noun phrase following a preposition is the Complement 
of the preposition, whereas the verb, verb phrase, noun 
or noun phrase governing a preposition or a preposi-
tional phrase is the Head. 
2.1  Over identified by its Complement 
Unlike the uses of over governed or required by the 
Head verb or noun, over the weekend in They have been 
unwell over the weekend can appear with almost all se-
mantic classes of verbs, as illustrated below. 
(1) a.  I heard over the weekend of a terrible fuss. 
 b.  He thought about it over the weekend 
        and accepted. 
 c.  Talks with bankers were taking place 
        over the weekend. 
 d.  It probably began over the weekend  
        of March 27. 
 e.  His father had died over the weekend. 
 f.  American diplomats arrived here over 
       the weekend. 
The phrase over the weekend appears with a sensation 
verb (1a), a cognition verb (1b), an occurrence verb (1c), 
an aspectual verb (1d), a change of state verb (1e) and a 
movement verb (1f). This suggests that over the week-
end is not required by a particular semantic class of 
verbs. At the same time, it is likely to be identified from 
the semantic features of the Complement noun phrase, 
which denotes a definite period of time in discourse 
during which an event takes place. This use of over is 
called over_during because it is similar to the usage of 
during. 
On the other hand, over can appear with the Com-
plement denoting an indefinite period of time in dis-
course, as in:  
(2)  Altogether, tutorials take place over a period of 
about twenty-four weeks. 
The Complements of over_during in (1) and this use 
share the semantic characteristic by referring to time of 
duration, but differ in that the former refers to a specific 
period of time in discourse while the latter only a length 
of time over which an event continues. This use is 
named over_duration. 
Another use that denotes a length of time is as fol-
lows: 
(3)  Skimming a chapter for its main ideas  
may be done over coffee. 
Unlike the other two we have seen above, the Comple-
ment does not refer directly to a space of time, but still 
the prepositional phrase implies an interval of time, in 
particular the duration of drinking coffee. Like the use 
of over_duration, the Complement does not refer to a 
definite period in discourse because the semantic func-
tion is to indicate a length of time. The Complement in 
this type is characterized by its meaning denoting meal 
or drink as well as by referring to a nonspecific meal or 
drink in discourse. This use is termed over_coffee. 
Like the three uses we have seen above, the follow-
ing is also likely to be identified by the syntax and se-
mantics of the Complements: 
(4)   We heard the news over the radio at lunch 
      break. 
The phrase over the radio indicates a means of hear-
ing the news. The Complement in this use is often a 
sequence of the definite particle the followed by a noun 
denoting a device of communication such as radio and 
telephone. Although the Head verb or noun tends to 
refer to a communicative act, as this use takes a Com-
plement with distinctive semantic features, it should 
belong to this group. It is called over_means. 
Another use of over that could belong to this group 
is the following: 
(5)  You can go all over the place. 
The Complement denotes a place in many cases, but 
sometimes a physical object, and this use of over is al-
ways preceded by all. Although the Head verb or noun 
tends to denote movement, this use also appears with 
other types of predicates, as illustrated below: 
(6)  a.  Paint all over the studio. 
 b.  He is known all over Europe. 
 c.  Tapes crash all over my desk. 
The following is a list of the prepositional uses of 
over that are likely to be identified by the semantic fea-
tures of the Complements:

ing the meanings of over 
 
2.2   Over identifiable by its Head 
Unlike the prepositional uses of over that are likely to 
be identified by the semantics of the Complements 
alone, the following are the uses that would require the 
semantic information of the Heads as well for identifica-
tion.  
2.2.1    Head denoting a physical event 
When the Head of over denotes movement and the 
Complement a place or a physical object, the over-
prepositional phrase indicates a place above which and 
across which an object moves, as given below: 
(7) a.  The bullet goes flying over my head  
and lands in the field behind me. 
 b.  Safe, efficient movement over snow and  
 ice is impossible without suitable  
 crampons. 
The prepositional phrase indicates a path over which an 
object moves, and therefore it is termed over_path. 
Another use of over indicating place is illustrated by 
the following example: 
(8)   After spreading her napkin over her lap,  
Alice began to eat. 
The prepositional phrase implies a place on which or 
above which an object sits. In this example, her napkin 
is placed over her lap. This use is called over_locus. The 
Head refers to an event denoted by a verb or noun be-
longing to the put verb class  (cf. Levin [93]) while the 
Complement a place or a physical object. 
In addition, this use is also used with a Head verb 
denoting the presence of an object as in: 
 (9)  An occasional loop stays over the needle  
after knitting the row. 
Indeed, this use is more complex than it appears. In a 
sentence with the BE verb, we find the following exam-
ples: 
(10)  a.  My painting is over the sofa. 
 b.  There were no taps over the sink. 
The use of over in this construction is tricky because it 
is difficult to distinguish from the use of over meaning 
about, as illustrated below: 
(11)  The disagreement here is over the substitutabil-
ity of assets. 
As complex as such, this construction would need a 
special syntactic treatment separately from other uses. 
That is, in this construction, the subject noun phrase is 
the Head of over, and thus the semantics of the subject 
along with that of the Complement must be examined 
for proper identification.  
Another special syntactic treatment should be given 
to an over-prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase 
or noun, as in: 
(12) I can just see the light over the door from 
where I?m standing. 
In this example, the Head is a noun phrase the light and 
the Complement the door. Since the Head is a physical 
object, and the Complement a physical object, the use of 
over is over_locus, which means that the Head entity is 
located at the Complement entity. When the Head in 
this nominal modifier construction denotes an event or 
state, as in his return flight over the North Sea, there 
would be no special treatment required. It can be treated 
in the same manner as when the verb is the Head. 
A special pragmatic knowledge should come into 
play  in the use of over_locus. It is not straight-forward, 
in fact, to determine this use only by the semantics of 
the Head and Complement. In every construction for 
this use, there is a possibility that the prepositional 
phrase indicates the meaning of across, as illustrated in: 
(13) a.  His apartment is over my flat. 
 b.  His apartment is over the river. 
Although both sentences have the same syntactic struc-
ture, they have noun phrases referring to different places.

 [syntactic features: all

As an apartment can be located over a flat in the real 
world, the meaning of the prepositional phrase in (13a) 
implies a place where an object is located (i.e. 
over_locus). On the other hand, as an apartment is usu-
ally not located above the river, the meaning in (13b) 
implies a place across where an object is situated. This 
latter use of over is named over_across. To distinguish 
between over_locus and over_across requires more than 
the semantics of the Head and Complement components. 
The distinction would require encyclopedic world 
knowledge. Without having such a knowledge system, 
this paper will treat both over_locus and over_across  in 
the same manner except for the fact that the default 
choice between the two is over_locus due to the much 
higher frequency in its use. 
2.2.2   Head denoting a nonphysical event 
There are four uses of over whose Head denotes a non-
physical event. The use we examine at first is illustrated 
in the following examples: 
(14)  a.  Marcos ruled over the Philippines for 20  
 years. 
 b.  He has considerable control over her      
 activities. 
 c.  He had one huge advantage over everyone 
                 else. 
The Head denotes an act of control or having more 
power. Among verbs of such a class are preside, rule, 
win, excel, dominate and tower. This use metaphorically 
implies that an object is above the other object in terms 
of power. 
The next use of over is found in: 
(15)  A general dictionary was preferred over  
the domain-specific dictionaries. 
The Head is a verb or noun denoting selection. Among 
them are prefer, choose, select, favor and the deverbal 
nouns.  This use is called over_prefer.  The noun coun-
terpart of a verb in this class, however, should be treated 
with care, because the over may imply the meaning of 
about, as in  
(16)  They are organized to allow the users  
choice over what to see, in the correct  
time sequence. 
What is going on is that over_prefer requires two enti-
ties in order to choose one over the other. When there 
are no such two entities between which to choose, as in 
(16), the meaning of over turns out to be that of about. 
On the other hand, when there are, the meaning is 
over_prefer, as illustrated in: 
(17)  One of the most basic freedoms anywhere  
is the right to peace, and the choice of  
quiet over noise. 
Since verbs of this family are transitive verbs requiring 
the Object, when the sentence contains both the Object  
noun phrase and an over-prepositional phrase, the mean-
ing of over_prefer obtains. In the proposed decision tree 
involving this use, the Head is limited to a verb, not a 
noun because of this syntactic freedom of a noun in this 
category. (To handle cases involving such a noun, a 
question as to the number of the arguments governed by 
the noun must be added.) 
A final discussion is about two uses named 
over_about and over_because. The use of over_because 
is illustrated in the following examples: 
(18) a.  Teachers were suspended over war posters. 
 b.   He quit over a bribery scandal. 
The over-prepositional phrase implies a cause of the 
event or state. It seems that the meaning of 
over_because requires a punctual event as in (18a) and 
(18b). On the other hand, over with durational verbs in 
this class gives rise to the meaning of over_about,  as 
illustrated by the following examples: 
(19) a.  He talked over the issue for three hours. 
 b.  Disputes over authorship are fiercely  
fought. 
 c.  There is growing concern over his illness. 
 d.  They thought over all the possible errors. 
The Head of this use denotes events of communication 
(such as hear and chat), agree events (such as disagree 
and fight), psychological events or states (such as worry, 
cry and agonize) and cognitive events or states (such as 
think and know). 
Table 3 shows the uses of over the meanings of

Head.

3 Decision Trees for Disambiguation 
How do we distinguish computationally the meanings of 
the prepositional uses of over listed in Tables 1 and 3? 
Based on Tables 2 and 4, which are lists of the semantic 
features in the Complements and Heads that are likely 
to identify the meanings of over, two decision trees are 
proposed.  One is used to identify the meanings of over 
from the semantic features of the Complements (Figure 
1 in the Appendix), and the other, from the semantic 
features of the Heads (Figure 2 in the Appendix). The 
first search for the meaning of over should start with the 
decision tree by its Complement (illustrated in Figure 1), 
because most prepositional uses of over characterized 
by the Complements denote time over event, and that 
means that they are the modifiers of events (at the level 
of verb phrases) rather than the modifiers of individual 
verbs (located inside verb phrases). After failing in the 
initial search at the decision tree by its Complement, 
another search for the meaning of over should take 
place at the decision tree by its Head in Figure 2. 
The decision tree in Figure 1 asks whether the Com-
plement of over refers and/or contains such features as 
listed in the diamonds, while in the decision tree in Fig-
ure 2, the question concerns the Head of over. 
The Head component of over can be a verb govern-
ing the over-prepositional phrase (as in I would 
PREFER coffee over tea), a verb phrase modified by the 
over-prepositional phrase (as in A BIG EARTHQUAKE 
OCCURED over the weekend) or a noun (as in He has 
considerable CONTROL over her activities). In the BE 
verb construction (such as The issue is over the election 
of the chairman), the subject is the Head of over. The 
Complement of over is a noun phrase governed by over 
(as in over THE SPRING BREAK).  
4 Evaluation 
An evaluation of the two decision trees was conducted 
manually by using 500 sentences containing over pro-
duced by the British National Corpus (BNC). Among 
the 500 instances of over, there are 382 prepositional 
uses. Among the remaining, fifty six (56) instances are 
those meaning more than or excess, which are located 
characteristically immediately before a quantity word or 
phrase. Examples are given below: 
     (20)  (a)  We have visited over 90 schools  
and reached 36,000 pupils. 
         (b)  Anything over this amount is, basically  
liable to inheritance tax at 40%. 
Twenty (20) instances of over are adjectives meaning 
completion, as in: 
     (21)  My war seemed to be over. 
Fifteen (15) instances are those used as adverb, an ex-
ample of which is illustrated: 
     (22)  ? , and read the list over and over again. 
The sentences including over and over again are re-
peated twice in the data because of the two instances of 
over in the phrase. The data contains six such sentences, 
resulting in 12 counts of over and over again. Seven (7) 
instances are used right before the to-prepositional 
phrase or toward-prepositional phrase, as in: 
     (23)  She went over to the Cookery and  
Refreshments Tent, but ? 
The distinction between such instances of over as in 
(21), (22) and (23) on one hand and prepositional uses  
on the other could be made by purely syntactic treat-
ments because of their different syntactic characteristics. 
Most of instances meaning more than or excess as illus-
trated in (20) are morphologically distinguishable from 
prepositional uses, because most of quantity nouns or 
noun phrases after over refer to something other than 
time. However, among the total 56 instances implying 
more than or excess, thirteen (13) quantity phrases refer 
to time. As such a phrase is composed of the same struc-
ture (over + noun/noun phrase) as an over-prepositional 
phrase, this appears to cause difficulty. But a careful 
examination of these constructions reveals otherwise. 
Such a phrase of quantity occurs in a syntactic position 
requiring a noun phrase, as illustrated in: 
     (24)  a.  ? after 12 years of living in those  
conditions, I would probably want  
to die myself.

              c.  ? since they were written over 10 
                       years ago, ? 
All these phrases of quantity are located either after a 
preposition such as for, in, within and after or in an ad-
verbial phrase ending with such a word as ago and late. 
Therefore, a good syntactic parser should be capable of 
distinguishing these quantity phrases with over from 
over-prepositional phrases.  
Two instances of over are found in quoted phrases in 
sentences. Eighteen (18) sentences are either incomplete 
(as in PUB REFURBISHMENTS ? OVER THE LIMIT 
and Over the wrenched?) or difficult to parse (as in 
First part over, second part starts and ? moved hard 
over in the direction of the spin). 
With the non-prepositional uses and anomalous in-
stances of over in the data aside, the next topic of dis-
cussion is about the three hundred and eighty two (382) 
prepositional uses found in the data. Among the 382, 
eighty seven (87) instances of over are parts of phrasal 
verbs or idiomatic phrases. Among the 87, fifty (50) 
instances of over do NOT govern a prepositional phrase, 
as illustrated below: 
     (25)  a.  And Dicky can take over as a footman. 
         b. She went over to fetch a cup of coffee. 
c.  I explain the position to the daughters  
and hand Mum over to them. 
              d.  ? there is no reason for their practiced  
eyes to cloud over when ? 
Thirty seven (37) instances of over are parts of phrasal 
verbs governing an over-prepositional phrase. Examples 
are given below: 
     (26)  a.  Go over the launch failure procedures  
after any long lay-off from flying. 
              b.  ? and failed promptly to hand over  
detainees to the police - ? 
With the lexicon containing sufficient information 
on such phrasal verbs, there would remain two hundred 
and ninety five (295) prepositional uses of over, the 
meanings of which must be distinguished. The decision 
trees proposed in this paper succeeded in determining 
the meanings of two hundred and seventy six (276) in-
stances, and failed to interpret the meanings of nineteen 
(19), resulting in a precision of 93.5 percent. However, 
if the system does not recognize phrasal verbs, the value 
of the precision will be lower. 
Some more problems and possible solutions are dis-
cussed here. It would be difficult to determine the use of 
over when the verbs in the sentence are conjoined, as in 
We finished our coffee and watched the seagulls whirl-
ing and shrieking over the harbour in the spring sun-
shine. When the verb shriek is categorized as a 
psychological verb, the use of over will be interpreted as 
over_about, which is a wrong interpretation in this case. 
The decision tree in Figure 1 will fail to recognize 
the following example because a search for the use of 
over_means requires the semantic feature +definite: ? 
the cruel, brutal voices that bellow over loudhailers 
about injustice ?. The Complement of over, loud-
hailers is not preceded by the definite article the, which 
is a requirement for identifying over_means. The feature 
+definite may be dispensable for sense identification, 
but it will be needed when the decision tree is used for 
generation, because the definite article often occurs in 
this type of prepositional phrase as in over the phone. 
A difficulty in determining whether a noun refers to 
a physical object or an abstract entity causes a problem. 
The example ? with the lying motto over its gate ? is 
hard to analyze. The use in this example is not 
over_about, but over_locus. With the correct interpreta-
tion of motto either as a physical object or a statement, 
the decision tree could lead to the right meaning of over. 
If motto refers to a physical object, the use of over is 
over_locus, whereas if it is not, the use is over_about. 
In the example such as The drag of the cable over 
one wing can make ?, the deverbal noun drag must be 
properly parsed as the Head of over in order to interpret 
the meaning of over correctly. 
Based on the assumption (a) that a syntactic parsing 
is successful, (b) that the over in phrasal verbs are rec-
ognized beforehand, and (c) that verbs and nouns are 
properly categorized into classes, the two decision trees 
could identify the meanings of most prepositional uses 
of over in the corpus. In addition, information on 
whether the Head event refers to a durational event or 
not would enable the tree to distinguish between 
over_about and over_because. Table 5 gives a break-
down of the instances of over found in the data (PP

5 Conclusion 
After examining the meanings, the prepositional uses of 
over have been divided into two groups: those whose 
meanings are identifiable by their Complements and 
those by their Heads. Previous studies have focused on 
the identification of the meanings of over, whereas the 
present paper not only on the meanings, but on the con-
texts for interpreting the meanings. 
Two decision trees have been proposed for determin-
ing the meanings of the prepositional uses of over by 
using the semantic features of the Head and Comple-
ment components. The decision trees are fairly simple 
and easy to implement in a system. The decision trees 
have been successful in identifying the meanings of the 
prepositional uses of over in data taken from BNC.
