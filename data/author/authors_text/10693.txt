Abstract 
We present a valency lexicon for Latin verbs 
extracted from the Index Thomisticus Tree-
bank, a syntactically annotated corpus of Me-
dieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas. 
In our corpus-based approach, the lexicon re-
flects the empirical evidence of the source 
data. Verbal arguments are induced directly 
from annotated data. 
The lexicon contains 432 Latin verbs with 270 
valency frames. The lexicon is useful for NLP 
applications and is able to support annotation. 
 
1 Introduction 
Over the last decades, annotated corpora and 
computational lexicons have gained an increas-
ing role among language resources in computa-
tional linguistics: on the one hand, they are used 
to train Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
tools such as parsers and PoS taggers; on the 
other hand, they are developed through auto-
matic procedures of linguistic annotation and 
lexical acquisition. 
The relation between annotated corpora and 
computational lexicons is circular: as a matter of 
fact, if linguistic annotation of textual data is 
supported and improved by the use of lexicons, 
these latter can be induced from annotated data 
in a corpus-based fashion. 
In the field of cultural heritage and in particu-
lar that of classical languages studies, much ef-
fort has been devoted throughout the years to the 
digitization of texts, but only recently have some 
projects begun to annotate them above the mor-
phological level. 
Concerning lexicology and lexicography of 
classical languages, a long tradition has produced 
and established many dictionaries, thesauri and 
lexicons, providing examples from real texts. 
Nevertheless, nowadays it is possible and indeed 
necessary to match lexicons with data from (an-
notated) corpora, and viceversa. This requires the 
scholars to exploit the vast amount of textual 
data from classical languages already available in 
digital format,1 and particularly those annotated 
at the highest levels. The evidence provided by 
the texts themselves can be fully represented in 
lexicons induced from these data. Subsequently, 
these lexicons can be used to support the textual 
annotation itself in a virtuous circle. 
This paper reports on the creation of a valency 
lexicon induced from the Index Thomisticus 
Treebank, a syntactically annotated corpus of 
Medieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas. The 
paper is organised as follows: section 2 describes 
the available Latin treebanks, their annotation 
guidelines and gives some specific information 
on the Index Thomisticus treebank; section 3 
deals with the notion of valency, while section 4 
describes the state of the art on valency lexicons; 
section 5 illustrates the procedures of acquisition 
and representation of our valency lexicon; fi-
nally, section 6 draws some conclusions and de-
scribes future work. 
2 Latin Treebanks 
Latin is a richly inflected language, showing: 
- discontinuous constituents (?non-
projectivity?): this means that phrasal con-
stituents may not be continuous, but broken 
up by words of other constituents. An exam-
ple is the following sentence by Ovid 
(Metamorphoses, I.1-2): ?In nova fert ani-
mus mutatas dicere formas corpora? (?My 
mind leads me to tell of forms changed into 
new bodies?). In this sentence, both the 
nominal phrases ?nova corpora? and ?muta-
tas formas? are discontinuous; 
- moderately free word-order: for instance, the 
order of the words in a sentence like ?au-
                                                          
1 See, for instance, the Perseus Digital Library (Crane et al, 
2001), or data repositories such as LASLA (Denooz, 1996). 
43
daces fortuna iuvat? (?fortune favours the 
bold?) could be changed into ?fortuna au-
daces iuvat?, or ?fortuna iuvat audaces?, 
without affecting the meaning of the sen-
tence. 
These features of Latin influenced the choice 
of Dependency Grammars (DG)2 as the most 
suitable grammar framework for building Latin 
annotated corpora like treebanks. 
While since the 1970s the first treebanks were 
annotated via Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG)-
based schemata (as in IBM, Lancaster and, later 
on, Penn treebanks), in the past decade many 
projects of dependency treebanks development 
have started, such as the ALPINO treebank for 
Dutch (Van der Beek et al, 2002), the Turin 
University Treebank for Italian (Lesmo et al, 
2002), or the Danish Dependency Treebank 
(Kromann, 2003). On the one hand, this is due to 
the fact that the first treebanks were mainly Eng-
lish language corpora. PSG were a suitable 
framework for a poorly inflected language like 
English, showing a fixed word-order and few 
discontinuous constituents. Later on, the syntac-
tic annotation of moderately free word-order lan-
guages required the adoption of the DG frame-
work, which is more appropriate than PSG for 
such a task. On the other hand, Carroll et al 
(1998) showed that inter-annotator agreement 
was significantly better for dependency tree-
banks, indicating that phrase structure annotation 
was requiring too many irrelevant decisions (see 
also Lin, 1995). 
Although much Latin data is nowadays avail-
able in digital format, the first two projects for 
the development of Latin treebanks have only 
recently started: namely the Latin Dependency 
Treebank (LDT) at the Tufts University in Bos-
ton (within the Perseus Digital Library) based on 
texts of the Classical era (Bamman, 2006), and 
the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB) at the 
Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, 
based on the Opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas 
(Passarotti, 2007). 
Taking into account the above mentioned fea-
tures of Latin, both the treebanks independently 
chose the DG framework as the most suitable 
one for data annotation. The same approach was 
later on followed by a third Latin treebank now 
                                                          
2 With Tesni?re (1959) as a common background, there are 
many different current DG flavours. See for instance the 
following: Dependency Unification Grammar (Hellwig, 
1986), Functional Generative Description (Sgall, Haji?ov? 
and Panevov?, 1986), Meaning Text Theory (Mel??uk, 
1988), Word Grammar (Hudson, 1990). 
available, which is ongoing at the University of 
Oslo in the context of the PROIEL project 
(Pragmatic Resources in Old Indo-European 
Languages): the aim of PROIEL is the syntactic 
annotation of the oldest extant versions of the 
New Testament in Indo-European languages, 
including Greek, Latin, Gothic, Armenian and 
Church Slavonic (Haug and J?hndal, 2008). 
2.1 Annotation Guidelines 
Since LDT and IT-TB were the first projects of 
their kind for Latin, no prior established guide-
lines were available to rely on for syntactic anno-
tation. 
Therefore, the so-called ?analytical layer? of 
annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank 
(PDT) for Czech (Haji? et al, 1999) was chosen 
and adapted to specific or idiosyncratic construc-
tions of Latin. These constructions (such as the 
ablative absolute or the passive periphrastic) 
could be syntactically annotated in several dif-
ferent ways and are common to Latin of all eras. 
Rather than have each treebank project decide 
upon and record each decision for annotating 
them, LDT and IT-TB decided to pool their re-
sources and create a single annotation manual 
that would govern both treebanks (Bamman et 
al., 2007a; Bamman et al, 2007b; Bamman et al, 
2008). 
As we are dealing with Latin dialects sepa-
rated by 13 centuries, sharing a single annotation 
manual is very useful for comparison purposes, 
such as checking annotation consistency or dia-
chronically studying specific syntactic construc-
tions. In addition, the task of data annotation 
through these common guidelines allows annota-
tors to base their decisions on a variety of exam-
ples from a wider range of texts and combine the 
two datasets in order to train probabilistic de-
pendency parsers. 
Although the PROIEL annotation guidelines 
are grounded on the same grammar framework 
as the LDT and IT-TB, they differ in a number of 
details, some of which are described in Passarotti 
(forthcoming). 
2.2 The Index Thomisticus Treebank 
The Index Thomisticus (IT) by Roberto Busa SJ 
(1974-1980) was begun in 1949 and is consid-
ered a groundbreaking project in computational 
linguistics. It is a database containing the Opera 
omnia of Thomas Aquinas (118 texts) as well as 
61 texts by other authors related to Thomas, for a 
total of around 11 million tokens. The corpus is 
morphologically tagged and lemmatised. 
44
Early in the 1970?s Busa started to plan a pro-
ject aimed at both the morphosyntactic disam-
biguation of the IT lemmatisation and the syntac-
tic annotation of its sentences. Today, these tasks 
are performed by the IT-TB project, which is 
part of the wider ?Lessico Tomistico Bicul-
turale?, a project whose target is the development 
of a lexicon from the IT texts.3
Presently, the size of the IT-TB is 46,456 to-
kens, for a total of 2,103 parsed sentences ex-
cerpted from the Scriptum super Sententiis Mag-
istri Petri Lombardi. 
3 Valency 
As outlined above, the notion of valency is gen-
erally defined as the number of complements 
required by a word: these obligatory comple-
ments are usually named ?arguments?, while the 
non-obligatory ones are referred to as ?adjuncts?. 
Although valency can refer to different parts of 
speech (usually verbs, nouns and adjectives), 
scholars have mainly focused their attention on 
verbs, so that the notion of valency often coin-
cides with verbal valency. 
Valency is widely used in DG formalisms, but 
it also figures in PSG-based formalisms like 
HPSG and LFG. 
While Karl B?hler can be considered as the 
pioneer of the modern theory of valency,4 Lucien 
Tesni?re is widely recognised as its real founder. 
Tesni?re views valency as a quantitative quality 
of verbs, since only verbs constrain both the 
quantity and the quality (i.e. nouns and adverbs) 
of their obligatory arguments; through a meta-
phor borrowed from drama, Tesni?re classifies 
dependents into actants (arguments) and circon-
stants (adjuncts): ?Le noeud verbal [?] exprime 
tout un petit drame. Comme un drame en effet, il 
comporte obligatoirement un proc?s, et le plus 
souvent des acteurs et des circonstances. Trans-
pos?s du plan de la r?alit? dramatique sur celui 
de la syntaxe structurale, le proc?s, les acteurs et 
les circonstances deviennent respectivement le 
verbe, les actants et les circonstants? (Tesni?re, 
1959: 102).5

4 In the Sprachtheorie, he writes that ?die W?rter einer bes-
timmten Wortklasse eine oder mehrere Leerstellen um sich 
er?ffnen, die durch W?rter bestimmter anderer Wortklassen 
ausgef?llt werden m?ssen? (B?hler, 1934: 173) (?words of a 
certain word-class open up around themselves one or sev-
eral empty spaces that have to be filled by words of certain 
other word-classes?; our translation). 
5 ?The verbal node expresses a whole little drama. As a 
drama, it implies a process and, most of the times, actors 
Arguments can be either obligatory or op-
tional, depending on which sense of the verb is 
involved. For example, the seem sense of the 
verb appear requires two obligatory arguments 
in active clauses, as in the following sentence: 
?That lawyer appears to love his work?. Here the 
second argument (?to love his work?) cannot be 
left out without changing the meaning of the 
verb. On the other hand, optional arguments are 
recorded into the verbal argument structure itself, 
althought they may not appear at the clausal 
level. For instance, in the following sentence the 
object required by the verb eat is missing, but the 
sentence is still acceptable: ?He eats (some-
thing)?. 
Optionality can also act at the communicative 
level as well as at the structural one. For in-
stance, adjuncts can be necessary for communi-
cative intelligibility in particular contexts, as in 
the following sentence: ?I met James at the Mar-
quee club?, where the locative adverbial (?at the 
Marquee club?) is required to answer a question 
like ?Where did you meet James??. On the other 
hand, structural optionality depends on the fea-
tures of the language and applies at the clausal 
level. For instance, as a poorly inflected lan-
guage, English requires the subject of a predicate 
to be expressed in declarative and interrogative 
main clauses, so that a sentence like the follow-
ing is ungrammatical if the subject is missing: 
?[I] slept all morning?. 
Given the so-called ?syntax-semantics inter-
face? (Levin, 1993), arguments are generally 
associated with a predicate sense rather than a 
predicate form, and are structured in sequences 
called ?subcategorization frames? (SCFs) or 
?complementation patterns?. For example, there 
is a semantic difference between the bill sense 
and the attack sense of the verb charge in Eng-
lish, as in the following sentences: 
- (a) ?The hotel charges 80 euros for a night?. 
- (b) ?The army charged the enemy?. 
In these sentences, the two predicate senses 
show two different SCFs: 
- (a) [Subj_NP, Pred, Obj_NP, Obj_PP-for] 
- (b) [Pred, Obj_NP] 
Arguments are also selected by verbs accord-
ing to lexical-semantic properties, called ?selec-
tional preferences? (SPs) or ?selectional restric-
tions?. For example, a sentence like ?*The train 
flew to Rome? is ungrammatical, since it violates 
                                                                                        
and circumstances. Transposed from the dramatic reality to 
structural syntax, the process, the actors and the circum-
stances respectively become the verb, the actants and the 
circumstants? (our translation). 
45
the SP of the verb fly on its subject and can only 
be accepted in a metaphorical context. 
4 Valency Lexicons 
Over the past years, several valency lexicons 
have been built within different theoretical 
frameworks: these lexicons have an important 
role in the NLP community thanks to their wide 
applications in NLP components, such as pars-
ing, word sense disambiguation, automatic verb 
classification and selectional preference acquisi-
tion. 
As shown in Ure?ov? (2004), a valency lexi-
con can also help the task of linguistic annotation 
(as in treebank development), providing annota-
tors with essential information about the number 
and types of arguments realized at the syntactic 
level for a specific verb, along with semantic 
information on the verb?s lexical preferences. 
In the phase of lexicon creation, both intui-
tion-based and corpus-based approaches can be 
pursued, according to the role played by human 
intuition and empirical evidence extracted from 
annotated corpora such as treebanks. 
For instance, lexicons like PropBank (Kings-
bury and Palmer, 2002), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer 
et al, 2006) and PDT-Vallex (Haji? et al, 2003) 
have been created in an intuition-based fashion 
and then checked and improved with examples 
from corpora. 
On the other side, research in lexical acqui-
sition has recently made available a number of 
valency lexicons automatically acquired from 
annotated corpora, such as VALEX (Korhonen, 
et al, 2006) and LexShem (Messiant et al, 
2008). Unlike the fully intuition-based ones, 
these lexicons aim at systematically reflecting 
the evidence provided by data, with very little 
human intervention. The role of intuition is 
therefore left to the annotation phase (where the 
annotator interprets the corpus data), and not ex-
tended to the development of the lexicon itself. 
Corpus-based lexicons show several advan-
tages if compared with traditional human-
developed dictionaries. Firstly, they systemati-
cally reflect the evidence of the corpus they were 
extracted from, while acquiring information spe-
cific to the domain of the corpus. Secondly, 
unlike manually built lexicons, they are not 
prone to human errors that are difficult to detect, 
such as omissions and inconsistencies. In addi-
tion, such lexicons usually display statistical in-
formation in their entries, such as the actual fre-
quency of subcategorization frames as attested in 
the original corpus. Finally, they are less costly 
than hand-crafted lexical resources in terms of 
time, money and human resources. 
While several subcategorization lexicons 
have been compiled for modern languages, much 
work in this field still remains to be done on 
classical languages such as Greek and Latin. Re-
garding Latin, Happ reports a list of Latin verbs 
along with their valencies (Happ, 1976: 480-
565). Bamman and Crane (2008) describe a ?dy-
namic lexicon? automatically extracted from the 
Perseus Digital Library, using the LDT as a 
training set. This lexicon displays qualitative and 
quantitative information on subcategorization 
patterns and selectional preferences of each word 
as it is used in every Latin author of the corpus. 
Relying on morphological tagging and statistical 
syntactic parsing of such a large corpus, their 
approach finds the most common arguments and 
the most common lexical fillers of these argu-
ments, thus reducing the noise caused by the 
automatic pre-processing of the data. 
5 The Index Thomisticus Treebank 
Valency Lexicon 
We propose a corpus-based valency lexicon for 
Latin verbs automatically induced from IT-TB 
data. The automatic procedure allows both the 
extension of this work to the LDT (thanks to the 
common annotation guidelines) and the updating 
of the lexicon as the treebank size increases. 
First, we automatically extract the argu-
ments of all the occurrences of verbal lemmata in 
the treebank, along with their morphological fea-
tures and lexical fillers. 
In the IT-TB, verbal arguments are anno-
tated using the following tags: Sb (Subject), Obj 
(Object), OComp (Object Complement) and 
Pnom (Predicate Nominal); adjuncts are anno-
tated with the tag Adv (Adverbial). The differ-
ence between Obj and Adv corresponds to the 
that between direct or indirect arguments (except 
subjects) and adjuncts. A special kind of Obj is 
the determining complement of the object, which 
is tagged with OComp, such as senatorem in the 
phrase ?aliquem senatorem facere? (?to nominate 
someone senator?). Conversely, the determining 
complement of the subject is tagged as Pnom, as 
in ?aliquis senator fit? (?someone becomes sena-
tor?).6
                                                          
6 As in the PDT, all of the syntactic tags can be appended 
with a suffix in the event that the given node is member of a 
coordinated construction (_Co), an apposition (_Ap) or a 
parenthetical statement (_Pa). 
46
In order to retrieve the arguments realised 
for each verbal occurrence in the treebank, spe-
cific database queries have been created to 
search for the nodes depending on a verbal head 
through the functional tags listed above. 
The head-dependent relation can be either 
direct or indirect, since intermediate nodes may 
intervene. These nodes are prepositions (tag 
AuxP), conjunctions (tag AuxC) and coordinat-
ing or apposing elements (respectively, tags Co-
ord and Apos). 
For example, see the following sentences: 
- [1] ?primo determinat formam baptismi;?7 
(?at first it determines the form of the bap-
tism;?) 
- [2] ?ly aliquid autem, et ly unum non deter-
minant aliquam formam vel naturam;?8 (?the 
?something? and the ?one? do not determine 
any form or nature?) 
Figure 1 reports the tree of sentence [1], 
where the Obj relation between the verbal head 
determinat and the dependent formam is direct.

Figure 2 shows the tree of sentence [2]. In 
this tree, two coordinated subjects (aliquid and 
unum) and two coordinated objects (formam and 
naturam) depend on the common verbal head 
determinant through two different Coord nodes 
(et and vel)9.

Tree of sentence [2] 
 
In the case of indirect relation, the interme-
diate nodes need to be detected and extracted, in 
order to be inserted into the lexicon as subcate-
gorization structures containing the syntactic 
roles of the verbal arguments. To represent these 
structures, we distinguished two major types of 
them: subcategorization frames (SCFs) and sub-
categorization classes (SCCs). 
An SCF contains the sequence of functional 
labels of verbal arguments as they appear in the 
sentence order, whereas an SCC reports the sub-
categorization elements disregarding their linear 
order in the sentence. SCFs and SCCs play a dif-
ferent role in our lexicon. On the one hand, SCFs 
are very detailed patterns useful for diachronic 
and/or comparative studies on linear order. On 
the other hand, SCCs are more general and make 
the data in the lexicon comparable with the sub-
categorization structures as usually defined in the 
literature and in other valency lexicons. For each 
of these structures we then created the following 
sub-types, ranging from the most specific to the 
least specific one. 
SCF1: subcategorization frame marking the 
full path between the verbal head (referred to as 
?V?) and each of its argument nodes in the tree. 
SCF1 also assigns the same index to those argu-
ment nodes linked by coordinating or apposing 
elements. For instance, the SCF1 of the verbal 
                                                                                        
and naturam, depends on the coordinating node vel. For 
more details, see Hajic et al (1999), 236-238. 
47
head determino10 in sentence [1] is ?V + Obj?, 
while in sentence [2] is ?(Coord)Sb_Co(1) + (Co-
ord)Sb_Co(1) + V + (Coord)Obj_Co(2) + (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(2)?. In the latter, the intermediate 
nodes Coord are in square brackets and indices 1 
and 2 link the coordinated nodes. These indices 
have been adopted in order to disambiguate sub-
categorization structures where more Obj_Co 
tags can refer to different verbal arguments. For 
instance, in a sentence like ?I give X and Y to W 
and Z?, both the tranferred objects (X and Y) and 
the receivers (W and Z) are annotated with 
Obj_Co. Using indices, the subcategorization 
structure of the verb give in this sentence appears 
as follows: ?Sb + V + (Coord)Obj_Co(1) + (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(1) + (Coord)Obj_Co(2) + (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(2)?. The indices cannot be applied a 
priori to subsequent arguments, since Latin, al-
lowing discontinuous constituents, can show 
cases where coindexed nodes are separated by 
other lexical items in the linear order. 
SCC1: the subcategorization class associated 
with SCF1. The SCC1 of the verb determino in 
[1] is ?{Obj}?, while in [2] is ?{(Coord)Sb_Co(1), 
(Coord)Sb_Co(1), (Coord)Obj_Co(2), (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(2)}?. 
SCF2: a subcategorization frame containing 
only the labels and the indices of the arguments, 
but not the full path. So, the SCF2 of determino 
in [1] is ?V + Obj?, while in [2] is ?Sb_Co(1) + 
Sb_Co(1) + V + Obj_Co(2) + Obj_Co(2)?. 
SCC2: the subcategorization class associated 
with SCF2. For determino, this is ?{Obj}? in [1] 
and ?{Sb_Co(1), Sb_Co(1), Obj_Co(2), Obj_Co(2)}? 
in [2]. 
SCC3: a subcategorization frame containing 
only the argument labels. The SCC3 of determino 
is ?{Obj}? in [1] and ?{Sb, Obj}? in [2], showing 
that in this sentence determino is used as a biar-
gumental verb, regardless of the number of lexi-
cal fillers realised for each of its arguments at the 
surface level. 
6 Conclusion and future work 
Presently, the size of the IT-TB valency lexicon 
is 432 entries (i.e. verbal lemmata, corresponding 
to 5966 wordforms), with 270 different SCF1s. In 
the near future, the lexicon will be enriched with 
valency information for nouns and adjectives. 
The corpus-based approach we followed in-
duces verbal arguments directly from annotated 
data, where the arguments may be present or not, 
                                                                                                                    
10 Determino is the lemma of both the wordforms determi-
nat (sentence [1]) and determinant (sentence [2]). 
depending on the features of the texts. Therefore, 
the lexicon reflects the empirical evidence given 
by the data it was extracted from, encouraging 
linguistic studies on the particular language do-
main of our corpus. 
In addition to the syntactic information re-
ported in the different types of SCFs and SCCs, 
it is possible at each stage to include both the 
morphological features and the lexical fillers of 
verbal arguments, helping define verbal selec-
tional preferences. 
The lexicon may also be useful for improv-
ing the performance of statistical parsers, enrich-
ing the information acquired by parsers on verbal 
entries. On the other hand, moving from parser 
performance to lexicon development, the lexicon 
can be induced from automatically parsed texts 
when an accurate parsing system is available. 
The syntactic and lexical data recorded in the 
lexicon are also important in further semantic 
NLP applications, such as word sense disam-
biguation, anaphora and ellipsis resolution, and 
selectional preference acquisition. Following a 
widespread approach in valency lexicons, a close 
connection between valency frames and word 
senses will be followed in the description of lexi-
con entries: this means that each headword entry 
of our lexicon will consist of one or more SCFs 
and SCCs, one for each sense of the word. 
We plan to make the lexicon available on-
line through a graphical interface usable also 
during the annotation procedures, as has been 
already done for the PDT via the tree editor 
TrEd.11 In this way, the consistency of the anno-
tation process can be tested and enforced thanks 
to the information stored in the lexicon. 
In order to test the accuracy of our system, it 
will be also necessary to evaluate the quality of 
our valency lexicon against the Perseus ?dy-
namic lexicon?, Happ?s list and other existing 
resources for Latin, such as traditional dictionar-
ies and thesauri. A comparison with the lexicon 
by Perseus is also very interesting in a contras-
tive diachronic perspective, as it may show im-
portant linguistic differences between Classical 
and Medieval Latin.

Abstract 
Assuming that collaboration between 
theoretical and computational linguistics is 
essential in projects aimed at developing 
language resources like annotated corpora, this 
paper presents the first steps of the semantic 
annotation of the Index Thomisticus Treebank, 
a dependency-based treebank of Medieval 
Latin. The semantic layer of annotation of the 
treebank is detailed and the theoretical 
framework supporting the annotation style is 
explained and motivated. 
1 Introduction 
Started in 1949 by father Roberto Busa SJ, the 
Index Thomisticus (IT; Busa, 1974-1980) has 
represented a groundbreaking project that laid 
the foundations of computational linguistics and 
literary computing. The IT is a morphologically 
tagged and lemmatized corpus of Medieval Latin 
containing the opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas 
(118 texts), as well as 61 texts by other authors 
related to Thomas, for a total of around 11 
million tokens. 
The Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB: 
http://itreebank.marginalia.it) is the syntactically 
annotated portion of the IT. Presently, the IT-TB 
includes around 220,000 nodes (approximately, 
12,000 sentences). 
The project of the IT-TB is now entering a 
new phase aimed at enhancing the available 
syntactic annotation with semantic metadata. 
Starting such a task needs to choose a theoretical 
approach and framework that supports the 
annotation style. Indeed, performing linguistic 
annotation of a textual corpus should be strictly 
connected to fundamental issues in theoretical 
linguistics in a kind of virtuous circle. On its 
side, theoretical linguistics serves as the 
necessary backbone for solid annotation 
guidelines; no theory-neutral representation of a 
sentence is possible, since every representation 
style needs a theory to extract its meaning. On 
the other hand, applying a theoretical framework 
to real data makes it possible to empirically test 
and possibly refine it. According to Eva 
Haji?ov?, ?corpus annotation serves, among 
other things, as an invaluable test for the 
linguistic theories standing behind the annotation 
schemes, and as such represents an irreplaceable 
resource of linguistic information for the 
construction and enrichment of grammars, both 
formal and theoretical? (Haji?ov?, 2006: 466). 
Further, the task of developing language 
resources like annotated corpora supports 
interaction between intuition-based and corpus-
based/-driven approaches in theoretical 
linguistics (Tognini-Bonelli, 2001). No intuition-
based grammar is able to manage all the possible 
100
variations in real data, and no induction-based 
grammar can reflect all the possible well-formed 
constructions of a language (Aarts, 2002; 
Sinclair, 2004a). 
This paper describes the first steps towards the 
semantic annotation of the IT-TB, by first 
presenting and motivating its theoretical 
background (section 2) and then sampling a 
number of specific aspects of annotation (section 
3). Finally, section 4 reports a discussion and 
sketches the future work. 
2 The Theoretical Background of the 
Index Thomisticus Treebank 
Hosted at the CIRCSE research centre of the 
Universit? Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, 
Italy (http://centridiricerca.unicatt.it/circse), the 
IT-TB is a dependency-based treebank 
(McGillivray et al., 2009). The choice of a 
representation framework alone does not 
determine the representation for a given 
sentence, as there can be many (correct) 
dependency-based (as well as constituency-
based) trees for even simple sentences. Thus, a 
fine-grained linguistic theory must be selected to 
support the specific aspects raised by a large-
scale annotation of real data. In this respect, the 
annotation style of the IT-TB is based on 
Functional Generative Description (FGD; Sgall 
et al., 1986), a dependency-based theoretical 
framework developed in Prague and intensively 
applied and tested while building the Prague 
Dependency Treebank of Czech (PDT). 
FGD is rooted in Praguian structuralism-
functionalism dating back to the 30s, one 
assumption of which is the stratificational 
approach to sentence analysis pursued by 
Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), a 
linguistic theory developed by Jan Firbas in the 
mid-1950s on the basis of Vil?m Mathesius? 
work (Firbas, 1992). According to FSP, the 
sentence is conceived as: (a) a singular and 
individual speech event [utterance-event]; (b) 
one of the possible different minimal 
communicative units (means) of the given 
language [form]; (c) an abstract structure (a 
pattern) [meaning]. 
Considering language as a form-meaning 
composite is a basic assumption also of FGD, 
which is particularly focused on the last point 
above, aiming at the description of the so-called 
?underlying syntax? of the sentence. Underlying 
syntax (the meaning) is separated from (but still 
connected with) surface syntax (the form) and 
represents the linguistic (literal) meaning of the 
sentence, which is described through dependency 
tree-graphs. 
This approach is consistent with the functional 
and pragmatic analysis of language pursued by 
the Prague Linguistic Circle since its very 
beginning, along the so-called ?first period? of 
the Circle (Raynaud, 2008). Language is 
conceived as ?un syst?me de moyens 
d?expression appropri?s ? un but? (?a system of 
purposive means?; Cercle linguistique de Prague, 
1929: 7). The ?moyens d?expression? correspond 
to the ?form? (surface syntax), while the fact that 
they are ?appropri?s ? un but? corresponds to the 
?meaning? (underlying syntax). 
The description of surface and underlying 
syntax in FGD is dependency-based mostly 
because dependency grammars are predicate-
focused grammars. This enables FGD to face one 
of the basic statements of the Prague Linguistic 
Circle: ?l?acte syntagmatique fondamental [?] 
est la pr?dication? (?the basic syntagmatic act is 
predication?; Cercle linguistique de Prague, 
1929: 13). Further, during the second period of 
the theory of predication pursued by the Circle, 
while accounting for the three-level approach to 
sentence in FSP, Dane? claims that ?[t]he kernel 
syntactic relation is that of dependance? (Dane?, 
1964: 227) and stresses the strict connection 
holding between form and meaning: ?we are 
convinced that the interrelations of both levels, 
semantic and grammatical must necessarily be 
stated in order to give a full account of an overall 
linguistic system? (Dane?, 1964: 226). 
Consistently with such a theoretical 
background, the PDT (as well as the IT-TB) is a 
101
dependency-based treebank with a three-layer 
structure, in which each layer corresponds to one 
of the three views of sentence mentioned above 
(Haji? et al., 2000). The layers are ordered as 
follows: 
- a morphological layer: morphological 
tagging and lemmatization; 
- an ?analytical? layer (i.e. the presently 
available layer of annotation of the IT-
TB): annotation of surface syntax; 
- a ?tectogrammatical? layer: annotation of 
underlying syntax. 
The development of each layer requires the 
availability of the previous one(s). Both the 
analytical and the tectogrammatical layers 
describe the sentence structure with dependency 
tree-graphs, respectively named analytical tree 
structures (ATSs) and tectogrammatical tree 
structures (TGTSs). 
In ATSs every word and punctuation mark of 
the sentence is represented by a node of a rooted 
dependency tree. The edges of the tree 
correspond to dependency relations that are 
labelled with (surface) syntactic functions called 
?analytical functions? (like Subject, Object etc.). 
TGTSs describe the underlying structure of 
the sentence, conceived as the semantically 
relevant counterpart of the grammatical means of 
expression (described by ATSs). The nodes of 
TGTSs represent autosemantic words only, while 
function words and punctuation marks are left 
out. The nodes are labeled with semantic role 
tags called ?functors?. These are divided into two 
classes according to valency: (a) arguments, 
called ?inner participants?, i.e. obligatory 
complementations of verbs, nouns, adjectives 
and adverbs: Actor, Patient, Addressee, Effect 
and Origin; (b) adjuncts, called ?free 
modifications?: different kinds of adverbials, like 
Place, Time, Manner etc.. The ?dialogue test? by 
Panevov? (1974-1975) is used as the guiding 
criterion for obligatoriness. TGTSs feature two 
dimensions that represent respectively the 
syntactic structure of the sentence (the vertical 
dimension) and its information structure (?topic-
focus articulation?, TFA), based on the 
underlying word order (the horizontal 
dimension). In FGD, TFA deals with the 
opposition between contextual boundness (the 
?given? information, on the left) and contextual 
unboundness (the ?new? information, on the 
right). Also ellipsis resolution and coreferential 
analysis are performed at the tectogrammatical 
layer and are represented in TGTSs through 
newly added nodes (ellipsis) and arrows 
(coreference). 
Since its beginning, the IT-TB has been 
following the PDT annotation style for both 
typological and structural reasons. As far as the 
former are concerned, Latin and Czech share 
certain relevant properties, such as being richly 
inflected, showing discontinuous phrases, and 
having a moderately free word-order and a high 
degree of synonymity and ambiguity of the 
endings. Both languages have three genders 
(masculine, feminine, neuter), cases with roughly 
the same meaning and no articles. As for the 
latter, the tight connection between the three-
layer structure of the PDT and a sound 
background theory like FGD integrates each 
layer of annotation into a more general 
framework driven by a functional perspective 
aimed at understanding the underlying meaning 
of sentences through its relation with the surface 
form. Moreover, tectogrammatical annotation 
includes several pragmatic aspects that, although 
much present in Latin linguistics research, are 
still missing from the available treebanks of 
Latin1. 
The organization of functors into inner 
participants and free modifications is further 
exploited by linking textual tectogrammatical 
annotation with fundamental lexical information

 Some semantic-pragmatic annotation of Latin texts 
is available only in the PROIEL corpus (Haug & 
J?ndal, 2008). The Latin subset of PROIEL includes 
Classical texts from the 1st century BC (Caesar, 
Cicero), the Peregrinatio Aetheriae and the New 
Testament by Jerome (both from the 5th century AD). 
102
provided by a valency lexicon that features the 
valency frame(s) for all those verbs, nouns, 
adjectives and adverbs capable of valency that 
occur in the treebank. The valency lexicon of the 
IT-TB is being built in a corpus-driven fashion, 
by adding to the lexicon all the valency-capable 
words that annotators progressively get through2. 
3 Moving From Analytical to 
Tectogrammatical Tree Structures 
As the tectogrammatical annotation of the IT-TB 
has just started and no Latin texts annotated at 
the tectogrammatical layer are available yet, we 
cannot train and use probabilistic NLP tools to 
build TGTSs. Thus, the annotation workflow is 
based on TGTSs automatically converted from 
ATSs. The TGTSs that result from conversion 
are then checked and refined manually by two 
independent annotators. Conversion is performed 
by adapting to Latin a number of ATS-to-TGTS 
scripts provided by the NLP framework Treex 
developed in Prague (Popel and ?abokrtsk?, 
2010). Relying on ATSs, the basic functions of 
these scripts are: (a) to collapse ATSs nodes of 
function words and punctuation marks, as they 
no longer receive a node for themselves in 
TGTSs, but are included into the autosemantic 
nodes; (b) to assign basic functors (such as Actor 
and Patient); (c) to assign ?grammatemes?, i.e. 
semantic counterparts of morphological 
categories (for instance, pluralia tantum are 
tagged with the number grammateme ?singular?). 
The annotation guidelines are those for the 
tectogrammatical layer of the PDT (Mikulov? et 
al., 2006). 
In the following, three examples of 
tectogrammatical annotation of sentences taken 
from the IT-TB are reported and discussed in 
detail. 
                                                          
2
 A syntactic-based valency lexicon of the IT-TB 
(named IT-VaLex) was induced automatically from 
the analytical layer of the treebank and made available 
on-line (http://itreebank.marginalia.it/itvalex) 
(McGillivray and Passarotti, 2009). 
3.1 Example A 
Figure 1 reports the ATS of the following 
sentence of the IT-TB: ?tunc enim unaquaeque 
res optime disponitur cum ad finem suum 
convenienter ordinatur;? (?So, each thing is 
excellently arranged when it is properly directed 
to its purpose;?, Summa contra Gentiles 1.1). 
 
Figure 1. Analytical Tree Structure A 
Except for the technical root of the tree 
(holding the textual reference of the sentence), 
each node in the ATS corresponds to one word 
or punctuation mark in the sentence. Nodes are 
arranged from left to right according to surface 
word-order. They are connected in governor-
dependent fashion and each relation is labelled 
with an analytical function. For instance, the 
relation between the word res and its governor 
disponitur is labelled with the analytical function 
Sb (Subject), i.e. res is the subject of disponitur. 
Four kinds of analytical functions that occur in 
the tree are assigned to auxiliary sentence 
members, namely AuxC (subordinating 
conjunctions: cum), AuxK (terminal punctuation 
marks), AuxP (prepositions: ad) and AuxY 
(sentence adverbs: enim, tunc). The other 
analytical functions occurring in this sentences 
are the following: Atr (attributes), Adv (adverbs 
and adverbial modifications, i.e. adjuncts), AuxS 
103
(root of the tree), Obj (direct and indirect 
objects), Pred (main predicate of the sentence). 
Figure 2 shows the TGTS corresponding to the 
ATS of this sentence. 
 
Figure 2. Tectogrammatical Tree Structure A3 
As only autosemantic nodes can occur in 
TGTSs, auxiliary sentence members labelled 
with AuxC, AuxK, or AuxP are collapsed. 
Analytical functions are replaced with 
functors. The nodes of the lemmas tunc and enim 
are both assigned the functor PREC, since they 
represent expressions linking the clause to the 
preceding context; further, tunc and enim are 
given nodetype ?atom? (atomic nodes), which is 
used for adverbs of attitude, intensifying or 
modal expressions, rhematizers and text 
connectives (which is the case of tunc and enim) 
(Mikulov? et al., 2006: 17). Res is the Patient 
(PAT) of dispono, as it is the syntactic subject of 
a passive verbal form (disponitur)4. Both the 
adverbial forms of bonus (optime) and convenio 
(convenienter) are labelled with functor MANN, 
which expresses manner by specifying an 
evaluating characteristic of the event, or a 
                                                          
3
 In the default visualization of TGTSs, wordforms 
are replaced with lemmas. 
4
 Conversely, syntactic subjects of active verbal forms 
are usually labelled with the functor ACT (Actor). 
However, this does not always hold true, since the 
functor of the subject depends on the semantic 
features of the verb. 
property. Unusquisque is a pronominal restrictive 
adnominal modification (RSTR) that further 
specifies the governing noun res. The clause 
headed by ordinatur (lemma: ordino; analytical 
function: Adv) is assigned the functor COND, as 
it reports the condition on which the event 
expressed by the governing verb (disponitur; 
lemma: dispono) can happen. The lemma finis is 
assigned the functor DIR3 (Directional: to), 
which expresses the target point of the event. 
Finis is then specified by an adnominal 
modification of appurtenance (APP). 
Three newly added nodes occur in the tree 
(square nodes), to provide ellipsis resolution of 
those arguments of the verbs dispono and ordino 
that are missing in the surface structure. Dispono 
is a two-argument verb (the two arguments being 
respectively the Actor and the Patient), but only 
the Patient is explicitly expressed in the sentence, 
i.e. the syntactic subject res. The missing 
argument, i.e. the Actor (ACT), is thus replaced 
with a ?general argument? (#Gen), because the 
coreferred element of the omitted modification 
cannot be clearly identified, even with the help 
of the context. The same holds also for the Actor 
of the verb ordino (#Gen), whose Patient 
(#PersPron, PAT) is coreferential with the noun 
res, as well as the possessive adjective suus 
(#PersPron, APP). In the TGTS, these 
coreferential relations are shown by the blue 
arrows that link the two #PersPron nodes with 
the node of res. #PersPron is a ?t-lemma? 
(tectogrammatical lemma) assigned to nodes 
representing possessive and personal pronouns 
(including reflexives). 
The nodes in the TGTS are arranged from left 
to right according to TFA, which is signalled by 
the colour of the nodes (white nodes: topic; 
yellow nodes: focus) A so-called ?semantic part 
of speech? is assigned to each node: for instance, 
?denotational noun? is assigned to finis. Finally, 
the illocutionary force class informing about the 
sentential modality is assigned to the main 
predicate of the sentence dispono (?enunciative?). 
104
3.2 Example B 
Figure 3 shows the ATS of this sentence: ?unde 
et earum artifices, qui architectores vocantur, 
nomen sibi vindicant sapientum.? (?Thus, also 
the makers of them, who are called architects, 
claim the title of wise men for themselves?, 
Summa contra Gentiles 1.1). 
 
Figure 3. Analytical Tree Structure B 
In addition to the analytical functions assigned 
to auxiliary sentence members in the tree of 
figure 1, this tree features one occurrence of 
AuxZ (particles that emphasize a specific 
sentence member) and two of AuxX (commas). 
Figure 4 presents the TGTS of the sentence in 
question. 
 
Figure 4. Tectogrammatical Tree Structure B 
Sentence members labelled with AuxK, or 
AuxX are collapsed. 
The tree reported in figure 4 features arrows of 
different colour. The red arrows that link both 
the relative pronoun qui and the reflexive 
pronoun sibi (assigned t-lemma #PersPron) with 
the noun artifex stand for so-called ?grammatical 
coreferences?, i.e. coreferences in which it is 
possible to pinpoint the coreferred expression on 
the basis of grammatical rules. Instead, the blue 
arrow represents a ?textual coreference?, i.e. a 
coreference realized not only by grammatical 
means, but also via context (mostly with 
pronouns) (Mikulov? et al., 2006: 998 and 
1,100). In figure 4, a blue arrow links earum 
(#PersPron) with the word ars, which occurs in 
the previous sentence in the text. 
Sibi (#PersPron) is assigned the functor BEN, 
because it is the beneficiary of the action carried 
out by the Actor (artifex) of the verb vindico. 
Sapiens has functor ID (Identity), which labels 
explicative genitives. Earum (#PersPron) is the 
Patient (PAT) of the noun artifex, because agent 
nouns are valency-capable nouns; for this reason, 
a newly added node with functor PAT is made 
dependent on the agent noun architector. This is 
assigned functor EFF (Effect), which is used for 
arguments referring to the result of the event, 
among which are obligatory predicative 
complements (i.e. the role played by architector 
with respect to voco). Voco is a RSTR, which is 
the functor assigned to the main predicates of 
attributive relative clauses. Et is a rhematizer, 
which has the noun artifex in its scope. 
According to Mikulov? et al. (2006: 1,170), in a 
TGTS the node representing the rhematizer is 
placed as the closest left sister of the first node of 
the expression that is in its scope. This is why the 
node of et in the TGTS reported in figure 4 
depends on vindico instead of artifex, while in 
the ATS of figure 3 it depends on the node of 
artifices. Despite its left position in the TGTS, 
the node of et is marked as focus in TFA and 
thus the colour of its node is yellow. 
105
3.3 Example C 
Figure 5 presents the ATS of the following 
sentence: ?ego in hoc natus sum, et ad hoc veni 
in mundum, ut testimonium perhibeam veritati.? 
(?For this I was born and for this I came to the 
world, to provide the truth with evidence?, 
Summa contra Gentiles 1.1, quoting the Gospel 
of John 18:37). 
 
Figure 5. Analytical Tree Structure C 
This sentence features two main predicates 
coordinated by the conjunction et: veni and natus 
sum, the latter being a complex verb, formed by 
the perfect participle natus and by the auxiliary 
verb sum, which is assigned the analytical 
function AuxV (collapsed in the corresponding 
TGTS). The fact that the two predicates are 
coordinated is signalled by the suffix _Co 
appendend to their analytical function (Pred). 
Those nodes that depend on the coordinating 
conjunction et and are not labelled with an 
analytical function suffixed with _Co are meant 
to depend on every member of the coordination. 
Thus, ego is the subject of both natus sum and 
veni, as well as the subordinate clause headed by 
perhibeam (via the subordinative conjunction ut) 
represents an adverbial modification of both the 
verbs. 
Figure 6 presents the TGTS corresponding to 
the ATS of figure 5. 
 
Figure 6. Tectogrammatical Tree Structure C 
The conjunction et is assigned nodetype 
?coap? (coordinations and appositions) and 
functor CONJ (Conjunction), used for the root 
nodes of paratactic structures. 
Veritas is the Addressee (ADDR) of the verb 
perhibeo5. Mundus is assigned functor DIR3 and 
subfunctor ?basic?, the latter specifying that here 
the meaning of DIR3 is the basic one, i.e. ?where 
to?6. The two occurrences of hic are respectively 
the Aim (AIM) of the verb nascor and of the 
verb venio, as well as the subordinate clause 
headed by perhibeo represents the Aim of both 
the coordinated predicates. 
The TGTS in figure 6 presents two textual 
coreferences, linking both the occurrences of hic 
with perhibeo. Indeed, the subordinate clause 
?[?] ut testimonium perhibeam veritati? is 
coreferent with the two occurrences of hic and 
makes their meaning explicit in a cataphoric 
manner; this is signalled by the direction of the 
arrows, which go from left to right (cataphora) 
instead of from right to left (anaphora), like in 
figures 2 and 4. 
4 Discussion and Future Work 
Recently funded by the Italian Ministry of 
Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), 
the project aimed at both providing semantic 
annotation of Latin texts and building a 
semantic-based valency lexicon of Latin has just

 Instead, the DIR3 node occurring in the tree of 
figure 2 is specified by subfunctor ?target?. 
106
started. So far, only the first 200 sentences of 
Summa contra Gentiles of Thomas Aquinas have 
been fully annotated at tectogrammatical level 
(corresponding to 3,112 words and 451 
punctuation marks). Such a limited experience 
on data does not make it possible to provide an 
evaluation neither of the ATS-to-TGTS 
conversion scripts nor of the inter-annotator 
agreement. Presently, the valency lexicon 
contains 221 verbs; the task of building the 
lexical entries for nouns, adjectives and adverbs 
is going to start in the very near future. 
Analytical annotation is available not only for 
Medieval Latin texts, but also for Classical Latin, 
as the guidelines for the analytical layer of 
annotation of the IT-TB are shared with the Latin 
Dependency Treebank (LDT; 
http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/), a 
dependency-based treebank including around 
55,000 words from texts of different authors of 
the Classical era (Bamman et al., 2007). By 
exploiting the common annotation style of the 
IT-TB and the LDT, our project will also 
perform tectogrammatical annotation of the 
Classical Latin texts available in the LDT and 
will build the corresponding valency lexicon.  
While enhancing a corpus with a new layer of 
annotation from scratch still remains a labor-
intensive and time-consuming task, today this is 
simplified by the possibility of exploiting the 
results provided by previous similar experiences 
in language resources development. Such results 
can be used for porting background theories, 
methods and tools from one language to another 
in a rapid and low-cost fashion. This is the 
approach pursued by our project, which wants to 
apply to Latin a treebank scenario originally 
created for Czech and now used also for other 
languages (including Arabic and English). Such 
an application meets and raises a number of 
issues specifically related to corpora of ancient 
languages, which make tectogrammatical 
annotation of such data a particularly difficult 
task. For instance, while treebanks of modern 
languages mostly include texts taken from 
newspapers, this does not hold true for both the 
IT-TB and the LDT, which contain respectively 
philosophical (IT-TB) and literary texts (LDT). 
These textual genres present several specific 
linguistic features in terms of syntax (quite 
complex in poetry), semantics (some words 
undergo a kind of technical shift of meaning in 
philosophical texts) and lexicon (high register 
words are pretty frequent). Further, the absence 
of native speakers often makes different 
interpretations of texts possible and increases the 
difficulty of tasks like TFA. 
As mentioned above, a large-scale application 
of a linguistic theory to real data helps to 
empirically test how much sound the theory is. In 
our case, the evaluation of the degree of 
applicability of FGD to Latin is at its very 
beginning. However, analytical annotation has 
shown a strong compatibility between the ATS-
based description of surface syntax and its 
application to Latin. As a matter of fact, the PDT 
manual for analytical annotation was adapted in 
just a few details for the treatment of specific 
constructions of Latin (such as the ablative 
absolute or the passive periphrastic) that could be 
syntactically annotated in several different ways 
(Bamman et al., 2008). This experience 
represents a positive background for a project 
that wants to build a set of theoretically-
motivated advanced language resources for Latin 
that will provide users with information about 
morphology, surface syntax and semantics at 
both textual and lexical level. 
Such advanced language resources for Latin 
will both improve the understanding of Latin 
language and question the usual research 
methods pursued by scholars in Classics. 
As for the former, research in Latin linguistics 
dealing with issues like semantic role labelling, 
valency, ellipsis resolution, coreferential analysis 
and information structure will finally be able to 
ground on a relevant amount of empirical 
evidence not created for the aims of one specific 
research, thus preventing the vicious circle of 
building a corpus just for studying a single 
linguistic phenomenon (Sinclair, 2004b). Also, 
making available language resources that both 
107
feature Latin texts of differents eras and share the 
same annotation style with language resources of 
modern languages will impact diachronic 
research and support studies in comparative 
linguistics. 
As for the latter, building advanced language 
resources for Latin by connecting a large-scale 
empirical analysis of Latin data with a modern 
and broadly evaluated linguistic theory 
represents a challenging and unconventional 
approach, which is expected to strongly impact 
the usual research methods in the field of 
Classics. Indeed, due to an age-old split holding 
between linguistic and literary studies, the study 
of Latin (and of Ancient Greek, as well) has been 
primarily pursued by focusing on literary, 
philological and glottological aspects. Further, a 
large number of classicists is, still today, 
unwilling both to apply computational methods 
to textual analysis and to use language resources 
like annotated corpora and computational lexica. 
Computational linguists, in turn, are more prone 
to develop language resources and NLP tools for 
living languages, which have stronger 
commercial, media and social impact. 
Considering collaboration between Classics and 
computational linguistics to be essential, this 
project provides an opportunity for innovation of 
both fields. 
Both the treebanks and the valency lexicon 
will be publicly available datasets with explicit 
annotation guidelines. This will make the results 
achieved by using these language resources 
replicable, which is a not yet consolidated 
practice in Classics.
