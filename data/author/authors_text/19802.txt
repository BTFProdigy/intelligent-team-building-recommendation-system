Abstract
We construct a hierarchically aligned Chinese-English parallel treebank by manually doing word
alignments and phrase alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees. The main
innovation of our approach is that we leave words without a translation counterpart (which are
mostly language-particular function words) unaligned on the word level, and locate and align the
appropriate phrases which encapsulate them. In doing so, we harmonize word-level and phrase-
level alignments. We show that this type of annotation can be performedwith high inter-annotator
consistency and have both linguistic and engineering potentials.
1 Introduction
The value of human annotated syntactic structures for Statistical Machine Translation has been clearly
demonstrated in string-to-tree (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), tree-to-string
(Liu et al., 2006; Liu and Gildea, 2008), and tree-to-tree (Eisner, 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010)
models. One recurring issue which hampers the utility of syntactic structures is the incompatibility be-
tween word alignments and syntactic structures (Denero and Klein, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008; Pauls et
al., 2010). The incompatibility arises because word alignments and syntactic structures are established
independently of each other. In the case of tree-to-tree models, there is also the issue of incompatible par-
allel tree structures resulting from divergent syntactic annotation standards that have been independently
conceived based on monolingual corpora (Chiang, 2010). In this paper, we report an effort in building
a Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (HACEPT) where we manually do word-
level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees. In this process,
we attempt to establish an annotation standard that harmonizes word-level and phrase-level alignments.
We also analyze a common incompatibility issue between Chinese-English parallel parse trees exposed
in the annotation process, with the goal of solving the issue by semi-automatically revising the trees.
In the rest of this paper, we describe how we construct the HACEPT and discuss issues arising in the
construction process. In Section 2, we discuss the problems of word alignment done without considering
its interaction with syntactic structures. In Section 3, we describe our annotation procedure where we
perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously in a coordinated manner, and show how
our approach is free of the problems discussed in Section 2. In Section 4, we report a common incom-
patibility issue between parse trees and propose a solution. We also compare the issue with translation
divergence (Dorr, 1994) and show that they are different in nature and occurrence frequency. In Section
5, we present the results of two experiments we have done on our annotation to show the intuitiveness of
our approach and the linguistic and engineering potentials of our corpus. We then describe related work
in Section 6 and conclude our paper in Section 7.

2 Incompatibilities between word alignments and syntactic structures
All the existing word alignment practice we know of treats word alignment as a stand-alone task with-
out systematically considering its interaction with the syntactic structure of a sentence. The inevitable
consequence of the practice is that both redundancies and incompatibilities between word alignments and
syntactic structures will arise in many places. In this section, we illustrate the issues through language-
particular function words, where the problems are most frequently found. Due to language-particular
idiosyncrasy and lack of lexical content, these function words usually do not have a translation coun-
terpart, which presents a great challenge to alignment annotation. There are two logical possibilities of
dealing with these words, both of which are represented in existing annotation practice. The first is to
leave them unaligned or link them to a fictitious NULL word (Ahrenberg, 2007; Brown et al., 1990), and
the second, which also seems to be the more common pratice, is to attach these function words to a word
that has a translation counterpart, and then align the function word and its host with the counterpart of
the host (Melamed, 1998; Li et al., 2009). For ease of discussion, below we will refer to the latter pratice
as the "glue-to-a-host" strategy (GTAHS). Both approaches are less than desirable: the former leaves the
function words unaccounted for, and the latter leads to incompatibility issues we discuss in detail below.
First note that, by attaching language-particular function words to a host, the GTAHS creates redun-
dancies between word alignments and syntactic structures since many of these function words have al-
ready been associated with a host within a constituent in the parse tree (e.g., the English determiner the
is placed inside the projection of its host, namely an NP). A more serious issue is that the GTAHS cre-
ates spurious ambiguities. Lexical ambiguity is inevitable in translation. For instance, the English noun
bank has more than one lexical meaning and each of the meanings corresponds to a different Chinese
word. That fact aside, the GTAHS creates spurious ambiguities, which, in our view, would be harmful
to Machine Translation (MT) if extracted as translation rules. Consider the following example, where
the Chinese noun?? is aligned to six English strings (aligned elements are underlined):
(1) a. eat apples <>???
b. eat an apple <>???
c. eat the apple <>???
d. fond of apples <>????
e. talk about apples <>????
f. provide them with apples <>?????
The English apple and the Chinese?? match in meaning and are both unambiguous. In cases where
the English noun is used with a determiner as in (1b) and (1c), since Chinese has no determiners and
the bare noun?? can be the appropriate translation for either an apple or the apple given a context,
the GTAHS attaches the determiner to apple and the whole string is aligned with??. In other similar
cases where an English element such as a preposition is absent in Chinese as in (1d), (1e) and (1f), the
GTAHS glues the preposition to apple and the whole PP is aligned with ??. With the GTAHS, the
unambiguous Chinese ?? ends up being aligned with more than one English string. This kind of
spurious ambiguity is very common given the GTAHS.
The second issue is that, by attaching function words to a host, the GTAHS effectively creates rudi-
mentary syntactic structures, which are often incompatible with the syntactic structures annotated based
on existing treebanking annotation standards. For example, all the aligned multi-word strings underlined
in (2) do not correspond to a constituent in a Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) or Chinese TreeBank
(Xue et al., 2005) parse tree:
(2) a. If I were him <>???????
b. He is visiting Beijing <>??????
1512
c. the beginning of the new year <>????
d. to quickly and efficiently solve the problem <>?????????
Given the incompatibilities between existing word alignments and syntactic structures, in the next sec-
tion we describe an approach where we perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously
on parallel phrase-based parse trees, attempting to construct a hierarchically aligned corpus where word
alignments are harmonized with syntactic structures.
3 Annotation specification and procedure
The data we annotate is the Chinese-English portion of the Parallel Aligned Treebank (PAT) described
in (Li et al., 2012). Our data consists of two batches, one of which is weblogs and the other of which is
postings from online discussion forums. The English sentences in the data set are annotated based on the
original Penn TreeBank (PTB) annotation stylebook (Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warner
et al., 2004), while the Chinese sentences in the data set are annotated based on the Chinese TreeBank
(CTB) annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang and Xue, 2012). The PAT
only has word alignments, which are done under the GTAHS, and no phrase alignments.
The main departure of our approach is that we loosen the requirement that every word in a sentence
pair needs to be word-aligned. On the word level, we only align words that have an equivalent in terms
of lexical meaning and grammatical function. For words that do not have a translation counterpart, we
leave them unaligned and locate the appropriate phrases in which they appear to be aligned. This way, we
eliminate both the redundancies and spurious ambiguities discussed in Section 2. Since phrase alignment
is done between syntactic nodes on parallel parse trees, we also eliminate the incompatibilities between
word alignments and syntactic structures. See the discussion of the concrete example in Figure 1 below
to see the points made here.
Next we discuss our annotation procedure in detail. Our annotators are presented with sentence pairs
that come with parallel parse trees. The task of the annotator is to decide, first on the word level and then
on the phrase level, if a word or phrase needs to be aligned at all, and if so, to which word or phrase it
should be aligned. The decisions about word alignment and phrase alignment are not independent, and
must obey well-formedness constraints as outlined in (Tinsley et al., 2007):
a. A non-terminal node can only be aligned once.
b. if Node n
c
is aligned to Node n
e
, then the descendants of n
c
can only be aligned to descendants of
n
e
.
c. if Node n
c
is aligned to Node n
e
, then the ancestors of n
c
can only be aligned to ancestors of n
e
.
This means that once a word alignment is in place, it puts constraints on phrase alignments. A pair of
non-terminal nodes (n
c
, n
e
) cannot be aligned if a word that is a descendant of n
c
is aligned to a word
that is not a descendant of n
e
on the word level.
Let us use the concrete example in Figure 1 to illustrate the annotation process, which is guided by a set
of detailed annotation guidelines. On the word level, only those words that are connected with a dashed
line are aligned since they have equivalents. Note that the Chinese words? (a function word used to
prepose the object to the left of the verb),?? (an adverb meaning "this way"),? (a modal meaning
"can") and the English discourse connective so that, the auxiliary verb is and the preposition from are all
left unaligned on the word level. Aligning these function words will generate artificial ambiguous cases
and create incompatibilities between word alignments and parse trees that have already been illustrated
and discussed in Section 2. For instance, if? is to be word-aligned, it would be glued to the noun?
? and the whole string??? will be aligned to the English gravity. Note that both?? and gravity
are unambiguous and form a one-to-one correspondence. With the word alignment between ? ??
and gravity, we make the unambiguous gravity correspond to both ?? and ? ?? (and possibly

more strings), thus creating a spurious ambiguity. Also note that the string ? ?? does not form a
constituent in the Chinese parse tree, so the word alignment is incompatible with the syntactic structure
of the sentence. By leaving? unaligned, we avoid both the spurious ambiguity and the incompatibility.
With word alignments in place, next the annotator needs to perform phrase alignments. Note that word
alignments place restrictions on phrase alignments. For instance, e
9
and e
10
will be ruled out as possible
alignments for c
10
, because??, a descendant of c
10
, is aligned to sludge, which is not a descendant of
either e
9
or e
10
. By contrast, e
3
is a possible alignment for c
10
because the alignment does not violate the
well-formedness constraints. The annotator then needs to decide whether this possible phrase alignment
can be actually made. This is a challenging task since, for a given phrase, there usually are more than one
candidate from which a single alignment needs to be picked. For instance, for e
3
, there are in total three
possible phrase alignments, namely c
10
, c
3
and c
9
, all of which obey the well-formedness constraints.
Since a non-terminal node is not allowed to be aligned to multiple non-terminal nodes on the other side,
the annotator needs to choose one among all the candidates. This highlights the point that the alignment
of non-terminal nodes cannot be deterministically inferred from the alignment of terminal nodes. This is
especially true given our approach where some terminal nodes are left unaligned on the word level. For
instance, the reason why c
9
is a possible alignment for e
3
is because the word?? is left unaligned. If
?? were aligned with so that, c
9
could not be aligned with e
3
since so that is not a descendant of e
3
and aligning the two nodes will violate Constraint b.
While Constraints b and c can be enforced automatically given the word alignments, the decisions
regarding the alignment of non-terminal nodes which satisfy Constraint a are based on linguistic consid-
erations. One key consideration is to determine which non-terminal nodes encapsulate the grammatical
relations signaled by the unaligned words so that the alignment of the non-terminal nodes will effectively
capture the unaligned words in their syntactic context. When identifying non-terminal nodes to align,
we follow two seemingly conflicting general principles:
? Phrase alignment should not sever key dependencies involving the grammatical relation signaled
by an unaligned word.
? Phrase alignment should be minimal, in the sense that the phrase alignment should contain only the
elements involved in the grammatical relation, and nothing more.
The first principle ensures that the grammatical relation is properly encapsulated in the aligned non-
terminal nodes. For example in Figure 1, if we attach the English preposition from to running and aligning
them to??, we would fail to capture the fact that from signals a relation between prohibit and running
downhill. Aligning VP
c3
with S
e3
captures this relation.
The first principle in and of itself is insufficient to produce desired alignment. Taken to the extreme, it
can be trivially satisfied by aligning the two root nodes of the sentence pair. We also need the alignment
to be minimal, in the sense that aligned non-terminal nodes should contain only the elements involved
in the grammatical relation, and nothing more. These two requirements used in conjunction ensure that
a unique phrase alignment can be found for each unaligned word. The phrase alignments (VP
c1
, VP
e1
),
(VP
c2
, VP
e2
), (VP
c3
, S
e3
), as illustrated in Figure 1, all satisfy these two principles.
In addition to making phrase alignments, the annotator needs to assign labels to phrase alignments. We
have four labels that are designed along two dimensions: the presence/absence of word order difference
and the presence/absence of unaligned function words. The name and definition of each of the four labels
are listed below, and an example for each label is given in Figure 2:
a REO, reordering that does not involve unaligned function words (Figure 2a)
b UFW, unaligned function words (Figure 2b)
c REU, reordering that also involves unaligned function words (Figure 2c)
d STD, structural divergence due to cross-linguistic differences (Figure 2d)

Figure 2: Phrase alignment types
Figure 2a is an example where there is a reordering of the immediate children of the aligned VP nodes.
This is a very typical word order difference between Chinese and English. In Chinese, the PP modifier
is before the verb while in English the PP modifier is after the verb. The phrase alignment illustrated
by Figure 2b has an unaligned function word, namely the English infinitive marker to, which has no
counterpart in Chinese. There are both reordering (difference in the relative order of powerhouse and
economy) and unaligned function words (Chinese? and English of ) in the phrase alignment in Figure
2c. Figure 2d provides an example where the aligned phrases have structural divergence caused by cross-
linguistic differences between Chinese and English, which we will discuss in some detail in Section 4.
4 A common incompatibility issue between parse trees
During the annotation process, we encountered some incompatibility issues between parse trees. For
a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the issues, see (Deng and Xue, 2014). Here we report the
most common issue, which is caused by differences between treebank annotation guidelines. As already
mentioned, the English parse trees we use are annotated based on the original PTB annotation stylebook
(Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warner et al., 2004), while the Chinese parse trees are
annotated based on the CTB annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang and
Xue, 2012). Since PTB and CTB are independently annotated, there are some differences in how certain
structures are annotated. The main issue is that certain structures are so flat as to make some nodes that
should be aligned impossible to be aligned. In general, our alignment task favors deeper structures over
shallower ones so that the annotator can have more choices. This is an issue for both Chinese and English
parse trees. To get a concrete idea of the issue, take a look at Figure 3.
As shown by Figure 3, VP
c1
and the English string probably decrease rapidly with distance, and VP
e1
and the Chinese string????????, cannot be aligned although they match in meaning and
should be aligned. They cannot be aligned because there is no node for either of the two strings in the
respective parse tree. Note that the incompatibility between the two trees here is due to a difference in
annotation style but not a deep cross-linguistic difference. Both PTB and CTB simplified the annotation
task by making the tree structures flatter to increase annotation speed, but the simplification does not
always come from the same places. The consequence of these annotation decisions is that relevant struc-
tures are sometimes incompatible, which has negatively affected their utility for MT purposes (Chiang,

.The
Figure 3: Unalignable nodes due to differences in tree representation
2010).
To solve this incompatibility issue, we need to create more structures through binarization, which can
be done automatically. Still take Figure 3 for instance, on the English side, if we create a new VP by
combining VP
e1
and its sister ADVP, the resulting VP can be aligned with VP
c1
. On the Chinese side,
if we do binarization to create a VP that dominates the string????????, VP
e1
would have
an alignment. Since changing tree structures has the potential risk of causing inconsistency with parse
trees in the original treebanks and had better be done systematically after all the annotation is finished,
we have not done binarization as of the writing of this paper. For the time being, we assign the label
UA (short for Unalignable Node) to nodes which should be aligned but cannot be aligned so that we can
gather some statistics on the extent of the problem. We will come back to revisit the nodes carrying UA
such as VP
c1
and VP
e1
by proposing systematic changes to the original treebanks.
The UA case discussed above should not be confused with another case of incompatibility, namely
structural divergence between parallel sentences in translation (Dorr, 1994). As shown above, UA is
basically an artificial issue that is caused by difference in parsing guideline design and fixable through
automatic binarization. Structural divergence arises mainly due to genuine cross-linguistic differences.
We provide an example of structural divergence (STD) in Figure 2d. As shown in the figure, the two
aligned phrases (VP and S) are structurally quite different: the English string is a clause with the NP the
sweat as the subject and the VP flowing over me as the predicate (the example is taken out of the sentence
I felt the sweat flowing over me to save space). The Chinese string is a simple verb phrase where the
adverb?? (literally whole-body) modifies the verb?? (literally emerge-sweat). In terms of meaning
correspondence,?? expresses the meaning of the English PP over me and the verb matches in meaning
with the sweat flowing. We have run an experiment on STD and found that the STD cases are pretty rare
(on average 5 instances in a file with 500 sentence pairs), indicating that the structural difference between
Chinese and English is not so fundamental as to make a big impact on alignment annotation.
1517
5 Annotation experiments
We did two experiments on our annotation. The first is about inter-annotator agreement (IAA), which
is a way of both evaluating the annotation quality and judging the intuitiveness of the annotation task.
An unintuitive annotation task would force the annotator to make subjective choices, which would result
in low IAA. Since the annotation task involves parse trees, ideally we need annotators who are trained
in syntax, but that would put a constraint on the pool of qualified annotators and make it difficult for
the annotation to scale up. In our annotation experiments, we use four annotators who are fluent in both
English and Chinese but have no prior linguistic training, led by a syntactician who performs the final
adjudication.
As of this writing, we have completed the single annotation of 8,932 sentence pairs, 2,500 of which
are double annotated. The IAA statistics presented in Table 1 are based on the double-annotated 2,500
sentence pairs, which are divided into 5 chunks of 500 sentence pairs each. The statistics are for phrase
alignment only, and the micro-average for the 5 chunks is 0.87 (F1), indicating we are able to get good
quality annotation for this task. In addition, the agreement statistics for the 5 chunks are very stable,
even though they are performed by different pairs of annotators, indicating we are getting consistent
annotation from different annotators.
Table 2 shows the result of the second experiment, namely the distribution of the different types of
phrase alignment. It shows that alignments that contain unaligned function words outnumber those that
do not, and that alignments that do not involve reordering outnumber those that do. It also shows that an
overwhelming number of alignments that involve reordering also have unaligned function words. This
means that the function words are potentially useful "triggers" for reordering, which is an important issue
that MT systems are trying to address.

Parallel treebanks are not something new. However, most of the existing parallel treebanks (Li et al.,
2012; Megyesi et al., 2010) do not have phrase alignments. Some (Sulger et al., 2013; Kapanadze, 2012)
do have phrase alignments, but neither discussion about the interaction between word-level and phrase-
level alignments nor report of IAA is provided. There have been a few recent attempts at automatically
aligning subtrees (comparable to our phrases) in the context ofMT research, and the automatic alignments
are evaluated against a small manually aligned data set. For example, (Tinsley et al., 2007) evaluated
an unsupervised algorithm on 810 parsed English-French pairs annotated with subtree alignment. (Xiao
and Zhu, 2013) also developed unsupervised subtree alignment methods (EM and Variational Bayes)
and evaluated their automatic alignment model on 637 sentences from the Chinese TreeBank (and use
the other 99 for tuning). (Sun et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2010a) also report work on aligning subtrees
and evaluate their impact on MT. However, we are not aware of any attempt to systematically harmonize
word alignment with the alignment of phrases, or subtrees, or to systematically study the incompatibilities
between parallel parse trees.

7 Conclusion
In this paper we report our effort on the construction of a Chinese-English parallel treebank with both
word-level and phrase-level alignments. When constructing the treebank, we systematically consider
the interaction between word alignments and phrase alignments, and try to harmonize the two kinds of
alignments by removing redundancies and incompatibilities between them. We show that this type of
annotation can be performed with high inter-annotator consistency. Given our intention for the treebank
to be a resource for MT, the next step is to synchronize the parallel parse trees, and of course, to perform
automatic hierarchical alignment experiments and MT experiments.

Abstract
We investigate the feasibility of aligning Chinese and English parse trees by examining cases of
incompatibility between Chinese-English parallel parse trees. This work is done in the context of
an annotation project wherewe construct a parallel treebank by doingword and phrase alignments
simultaneously. We discuss the most common incompatibility patterns identified within VPs and
NPs and show that most cases of incompatibility are caused by divergent syntactic annotation
standards rather than inherent cross-linguistic differences in language itself. This suggests that in
principle it is feasible to align the parallel parse trees with somemodification of existing syntactic
annotation guidelines. We believe this has implications for the use of parallel parse trees as an
important resource for Machine Translation models.
1 Introduction
Parallel treebanks have been proved to be a valuable resource inMachine Translation research (Gildea,
2003; Liu et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Chiang, 2010; Xiao and Zhu, 2013), but one issue that hampers
their utility is the incompatibility between the syntactic parse trees for a sentence pair (Chiang, 2010), as
the trees are annotated based on independently developed monolingual syntactic annotation standards.
For example, even though the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and English TreeBank (Marcus
et al., 1993) are often referred to collectively as the Penn series of treebanks and are both annotated
with phrase structure trees in very similar annotation frameworks, different annotation decisions have
led to divergent tree structures (Chiang, 2010). The purpose of this study is to investigate to what extent
the divergences between Chinese-English parallel parse trees are caused by different annotation styles
(and therefore can be avoided by revising the annotation guidelines), and to what extent they are caused
by cross-linguistic differences inherent in language. The answer to this question would shed light on
whether it is possible to align the parse trees in parallel treebanks, and on the feasibility of building
Machine Translation systems based on these aligned parallel treebanks.
The question above cannot be answered without first having a concrete alignment specification and
knowing what types of alignments are attempted. No incompatibility issue would arise for sentence-level
alignment when sentences are aligned as a whole. By contrast, both word-level alignment (or the align-
ment of terminal nodes) and phrase-level alignment (or the alignment of non-terminal nodes) interact
with syntactic structures, which could potentially cause incompatibility between the alignments and the
tree structures. In the next section, we outline an alignment approach where we perform word alignments
and phrase alignments simultaneously in a parallel Chinese-English treebank to prevent incompatibili-
ties between word alignments and syntactic structures. The alignment approach alone, however, does
not prevent incompatibilities between the two parse trees of a sentence pair, which are either due to in-
herent cross-linguistic divergences or differences in treebank annotation styles. In Section 3, we report
three types of incompatibilities between the syntactic structures of a sentence pair that prevent proper

phrase-level alignments. We analyze two of them and show how they make certain phrase alignments
impossible. In Section 4, we discuss the third and also the most common type of incompatibility, which
is caused by different annotation decisions as specified in the Penn Chinese and English Treebank syn-
tactic bracketing guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000; Bies et al., 1995). We propose modifications to the
tree structures for the purpose of aligning the parse trees, which means that proper phrase alignment is
possible if certain common patterns of incompatibility in syntactic parse trees are fixed. We conclude
our paper in Section 5 and touch on the workshop theme. We argue that the quality and level of linguistic
sophistication of an linguistic annotation project is tied to the purpose of the resource, and how it is going
to be used.
2 Overview of the HACEPT Project
The purpose of the HACEPT (Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel TreeBank) Project is
to perform word-level and phrase-level alignments between parallel parse trees to develop a linguistic re-
source for Machine Translation models. We are currently in the process of aligning about 9,000 sentence
pairs where syntactic parses already exist for sentences on both the Chinese and English side.
In our project, the annotator is presented with a pair of parallel Chinese-English sentences which have
parse trees. The task of the annotator is to do both word and phrase alignments between the two parse
trees. The reason for doing word alignments and phrase alignments simultaneously is to make sure word
alignments and syntactic structures are harmonized to avoid both redundancies and incompatibilities.
Let us use the concrete example in Figure 1 to illustrate the point.
A big challenge to word alignment comes from language-particular function words that do not have
counterparts in the translation language. Take the sentences in Figure 1 for instance, the Chinese pre-
nominal modification marker? has no English counterpart. Similarly, the English infinitive marker to
has no Chinese counterpart. Word alignments done without taking syntactic structures into considera-
tion generally glue a function word such as? and to here to a neighboring content word which has a
counterpart and align the two words together to the counterpart of the content word (Li et al., 2009).
Under this practice, the first? will be glued to??/country, and the two words??/country? as a
whole will be aligned to countries. Similarly, to will be glued to weigh in and the whole string to weigh
in will be aligned to ??/weigh in. In our project, we take a different approach to word alignments:
we leave all the words without a counterpart unaligned on the word level and mark them as "extra". For
each unaligned word, we locate the appropriate phrase which contains the unaligned word and has a
phrasal counterpart on the other side. By aligning the two phrases, the unaligned word is captured in its
appropriate context. Under this new strategy, the Chinese? and the English to are both left unaligned
on the word level. For?, we align the NP??/all??/country???/people with the NP people
in all countries, because the Chinese NP is the relevant context where? appears (? is used in the NP
to indicate that??/all??/country is the modifier of the noun??/people) and matches in meaning
with the English NP. For to, we align the VP use their own methods of expression to weigh in on thiswith
the VP??/use??/own???/expression??/method??/weigh in?/this?/thing, because to
is used in the English VP to connect use their own methods of expression and weigh in on this and also
because the English VP and the Chinese one matches in meaning.
Under our approach, word alignments and syntactic structures are harmonized, and both redundancies
and incompatibilities between the two are avoided. For example, the phrase alignment between the
two NPs??/all??/country???/people and people in all countries specifies the context for the
occurrence of the function word ?. There is no need to glue ? to the previous noun ??/country
on the word level. As a matter of fact, the host of ? (namely the modifier signaled by it) is not the
noun ??/country but the NP ??/all ??/country. Similarly, the phrase alignment between use
their own methods of expression to weigh in on this and ??/use ??/own ? ??/expression ?
?/method??/weigh in?/this?/thing captures the syntactic environment in which to appears. The
phrase alignment also avoids an incompatibility issue caused by attaching to to weigh in and aligning the

A natural question arises for our approach: cross-linguistic divergences between languages may cause
parse tree incompatibilities to arise, which calls into question the possibility of doing phrase alignments
to a useful extent. The fact is that we did find incompatibilities between parse trees in our annotation. In
the next section, we report three types of parse tree incompatibilities we have encountered.
3 Three types of parse tree incompatibilities
During the annotation process, we encountered three types of parse tree incompatibilities that make
some phrase alignments impossible. The three types are distinguished by the sources of their occurrence
and are listed below:
Three types of incompatibilities between parallel parse trees:
a. Incompatibilities caused by lexical-semantic differences between the two languages
b. Incompatibilities caused by translation-related reasons
c. Incompatibilities caused by different annotation standards
Let us look at the first type. On the lexical level, languages differ in terms of whether or not a piece
of semantic information is encoded in a lexical item. For instance, Chinese does not have a verb that ex-
presses the meaning of the English verb prioritize, which needs to be translated using a phrase. This does
not necessarily cause problems for phrase alignments. Taking prioritize for instance, the English phrase
prioritize transportation projects is translated as ??/arrange ??/transportation ??/project ? ?
?/priority ??/order (literally arrange transportation projects' priority order, i.e., prioritize trans-
portation projects). Note that a phrase alignment can be made between the two VPs and also the two
NPs transportation projects and ??/transportation ??/project despite the fact that the meaning of
prioritize is expressed by a discontinuous phrase in Chinese (??/arrange ????/priority??/or-
der, i.e., arrange the priority order of ...). The most extreme case in this category which usually causes
incompatibilities and makes phrase-level alignment impossible is idiomatic expressions. An idiom is
a single lexical item just like a word and its meaning generally has to be expressed literally in another
language. For instance, the idiomatic part in Markets function best so long as no one has a finger on
the scale is translated as (??/so long as)??/everyone??/justly??/act (??/market??/func-
tion?/most?/good), which literally is everyone justly acts. The parse tree for both the English idiom
and its Chinese translation is given in Figure 2. No phrase alignment is possible between the idiom and
its translation except that between the two root nodes that dominate each string. Phrase alignments are
reduced to a minimal extent in cases like this.
Now let us discuss the second type. Consider this example, where the Chinese sentence?/he??/not
??/mention?/this?/one?/point (He did't mention this point) is translated as There was no mention
made of this by him. Given this particular translation, it is impossible to make a phrase alignment between
the Chinese VP??/not??/mention?/this?/one?/point and no mention made of this although
the two strings match in meaning. This is because, as shown in Figure 3, the NP node that dominates
the English string also dominates the PP by him. Note that him in the PP corresponds to?/he, which
is outside the Chinese VP. The issue here is caused by the translation. Note that the Chinese sentence is
in active voice, but the given translation is in passive voice, which is why the PP by him appears at the
end of the sentence and causes the problem. If the more literal translation He didn't mention this point
were provided,??/not??/mention?/this?/one?/point could be aligned with didn't mention this
point, and??/mention?/this?/one?/point could be aligned with mention this point, which is also
impossible with the given translation. Phrase alignments are reduced by some extent in cases like this.
For the first two types of incompatibilities already discussed, the negative impact of them on phrase
alignments can be reduced by the enlargement of the corpus, which currently has 8, 932 sentence pairs.

Idioms which make phrase-level alignment impossible are rare in our corpus. On average, there are about
5 cases in a file of 500 sentence pairs. As for the incompatibilities caused by translation, it is possible
for the phrase alignments missed in those cases to be made up if the phrases involved reappear in a more
literal translation. These two issues do not pose a real threat to our approach. As annotators, we cannot
do much about these two issues, especially the latter one, since our data is got as is. Due to these two
reasons, we will not discuss them further in this paper.
Next let us turn to the last type of incompatibility. Use the sentence pair in Figure 1 for instance. Note
that the Chinese VP ??/use ??/own ? ??/expression ??/method matches the English string
use their own methods of expression in terms of both grammaticality and meaning. However, the English
parse tree has no phrasal node for the string that could form an alignment to the Chinese VP. Similarly,
the Chinese NP??/expression??/method corresponds to the English string methods of expression,
but again, no phrasal node is present in the English parse tree that could be aligned with the Chinese NP.
Our statistics shows that, in a file with 500 sentence pairs, there are approximately 50 instances of the
incompatibility in VPs illustrated here and 20 in NPs (an instance is a case where a legitimate phrase
alignment cannot be made). These are both quite high frequency. In the next section, we discuss the
reason for the incompatibility and give a solution to fix the issue.
4 A common incompatibility pattern and its solution
There is a pattern for the incompatibility illustrated at the end of Section 3. The cause for the incom-
patibility is the bracketing annotation of the complement-adjunct distinction made by the Penn Treebank
(PTB) bracketing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995). The pattern is found in both VPs and NPs.
Let us discuss VPs first. To see the pattern, we need some background information about the internal
composition of both English and Chinese VPs and how VPs are parsed according to PTB and CTB
annotation standards. Let us start with the English VP. Besides the verb, there can be both preverbal and
postverbal constituents in an English VP. Preverbal constituents are much more restricted than postverbal
constituents in terms of both phrase types and the number of constituents allowed. Most commonly
seen in our corpus, an ADVP is present before the verb if there is a preverbal constituent at all. By
contrast, various kinds of constituents (NP, PP, ADVP, S) can appear post-verbally and more than one
of these phrases can co-occur. When there is more than one post-verbal constituent, quite often one of
them is the complement of the verb and the others are adjuncts. Due to engineering considerations, the
PTB bracketing guidelines decided on a flat structure for the English VP, where preverbal and postverbal
constituents and the verb are treated as sisters that are directly attached to the VP-node (Bies et al., 1995).
A general structure for the English VP is given in Figure 4a, where it can be seen that the complement-
adjunct distinction is not made.
Now let us turn to the Chinese VP. In a Chinese VP, there can also be both preverbal and postver-
bal constituents, but the situation is quite different from that in English. Unlike in English VPs where
postverbal constituents are freer, postverbal constituents in Chinese VPs are restricted and can only be
34
the complement of the verb or one particular kind of phrase, namely QP, which includes counting phrases
such as three times as in went there three times, and duration phrases such as for three years as in lived
there for three years. Adjuncts including ADVP, PP, and different kinds of adverbial clauses come be-
fore the verb. The second difference is that Chinese strongly favors no more than one constituent after
the verb. In theory, a complement phrase and a QP can co-occur after the verb, but in reality, if the two
co-occur in a sentence, the complement will most likely be preposed to the left of the verb by either
topicalization or the introduction of the function word?, leaving QP the only post-verbal element. The
structure of a Chinese VP stipulated by the CTB bracketing standards (Xue and Xia, 2000) is provided
in Figure 4b.
Now let us compare the two structures in Figure 4. Note that in the English VP there is no phrasal node
that dominates the verb and its immediate sister on the right, which, in many cases, is the complement of
the verb. By contrast, there is a node in the Chinese VP (the boxed VP) that groups together the verb and
a post-verbal constituent, which could be either the complement or a QP (some QPs are complements and
some others are adjuncts, an issue that does not need to bother us here). This is where the incompatibility
arises: the boxed VP-node in the Chinese tree has no node-counterpart to align with in the English tree,
but the string dominated by that boxed VP has a match in the English sentence. The example in Figure 1
illustrates the issue, where the Chinese VP dominating the string??/use??/own???/expression
??/method has no possible phrase alignment although the string corresponds in meaning to the English
string use their own methods of expression.
To eliminate the incompatibility, an extra layer of projection is needed in the English tree. To be
specific, we need to combine the verb and its complement to create a VP node, which then can be aligned
to the boxed VP in the Chinese tree. Still using the example in Figure 1 for instance, we need to create a
VP node by combining the English verb use and its object NP their own methods of expression, so that
the Chinese VP??/use??/own???/expression??/method can be aligned with the resultant
VP. This can be done through binarization.
Now let us turn to the pattern in NPs. We will look at the English NP first. There can be constituents
both before and after the head in an English NP. Post-nominal constituents can be either a PP or an S
whereas pre-nominal constituents can be one or more than one of the following kinds of elements: deter-
miners (the/a/an), demonstratives (this/that etc.), quantifiers (some, many etc.), numerals and adjectives.
The PTB bracketing guidelines make the decision that all pre-nominal elements and the head be grouped
together using a flat structure to form a NP, which then is treated as a sister of a post-nominal constituent,
be it a complement or an adjunct. As for the Chinese NP, the major difference between a Chinese NP
and an English one is that there can only be pre-nominal constituents in Chinese NPs. In other words,
the head noun is the rightmost element in a Chinese NP and nothing comes after it.
The incompatibility has to do with the complement-adjunct distinction. The complement of an English
noun can be either a PP or an S, which always comes after the noun. Due to space limit, we only discuss
PP below. An English noun and its PP complement, because of the close semantic relationship between
the two, are usually translated as a compound noun in Chinese. For instance, student of linguistics is
translated as the N-N compound???/linguistics??/student. A compound is treated by the CTB
bracketing standard as an NP dominating all its components. Unfortunately, the English head noun and
its complement do not form a constituent, which, if present, can be aligned with the node for the Chinese
compound. This causes incompatibility to arise. Take Figure 1 for instance, the English string methods
of expression is translated as the Chinese compound noun??/expression??/method. As shown by
the structure, the noun method and its PP complement do not form a constituent. As a result, the Chinese
compound noun has no alignment.
To remove the incompatibility, we need to change the existing structure of the English NP. Still using
the example in Figure 1 for instance, if the English noun phrase has the structure in Figure 5, then we can
align the English NP methods of expression with the Chinese NP ??/expression ??/method. The
structure in Figure 5 is different from what is given by the PTB standards in that the head noun (such as

method) is combined with its complement (such as the PP of expression) first to create an NP, which then
is modified by, say, an adjective (such as own) and a determiner (such as their). From the semantic point
of view, a pre-nominal adjective is an adjunct to the head noun that is not as closely related to the head
noun as its complement. The new structure given in Figure 5b reflects this semantic fact by combining
the complement with the head before the adjective.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we argue that it is feasible to align Chinese-English parallel parse trees despite incompat-
ibility issues. We show that the most common incompatibility is caused by bracketing guideline design,
which can be fixed by changing the existing structures stipulated by the current annotation standards.
The revised structures we proposed to avoid the incompatibility are deeper than the existing PTB struc-
tures and respect the complement-adjunct distinction, which is a well-established notion in linguistics
that has been shown to manifest itself in different kinds of phenomena cross-linguistically. In syntax, the
distinction is made by combining the head and its complement first to form a constituent, which then is
combined with an adjunct. This way of representing the distinction is standard and gives arise to a struc-
ture that is binary-branching and deep. In syntactic annotation, linguistic sophistication which requires
the parse tree to reflect well-established linguistic notions such as the complement-adjunct distinction is
an important consideration and generally gives arise to deeper structures. In addition to linguistic sophis-
tication, another important consideration in syntactic annotation is engineering economy, which requires
the annotation to be economical in the sense that it can be carried out in a convenient and efficient manner
to save annotation effort and time. This means that the parse tree needs to be as flat as possible since shal-
low structures are much easier to annotate than deep ones. These two competing considerations interact
to influence the establishment of bracketing standards.
Due to engineering pressure caused by the fact that it is not easy to make a consistent distinction
between complements and adjuncts in annotation, the PTB bracketing guidelines chose a shallow struc-
ture for both VPs and NPs as shown above. The decision is understandable since no incompatibility
ever arises in the construction of a monolingual treebank like PTB. With the advent of new use cases of
monolingual treebanks such as hierarchically aligned parallel treebanks, new issues like incompatibility
emerge and call for adjustments to some decisions that have been made without such issues. As shown
in Section 4, some decisions made in existing bracketing annotation cause incompatibilities and make
legitimate phrase alignments impossible. For the purpose of aligning parallel parse trees, deeper and lin-
guistically motivated structures are needed. This raises the interesting question whether we should have
a deeper and linguistically motivated structure to start with when constructing a monolingual treebank.
Based on what we have seen in this paper, a positive answer to the question seems reasonable at least
in some cases such as VPs and NPs for the sake of better serving uses cases like constructing parallel
36
treebanks with hierarchical alignments.
