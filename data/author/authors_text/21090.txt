Abstract
To avoid a sarcastic message being understood
in its unintended literal meaning, in microtexts
such as messages on Twitter.com sarcasm is
often explicitly marked with the hashtag ?#sar-
casm?. We collected a training corpus of about
78 thousand Dutch tweets with this hashtag.
Assuming that the human labeling is correct
(annotation of a sample indicates that about
85% of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we
train a machine learning classifier on the har-
vested examples, and apply it to a test set of
a day?s stream of 3.3 million Dutch tweets.
Of the 135 explicitly marked tweets on this
day, we detect 101 (75%) when we remove the
hashtag. We annotate the top of the ranked list
of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not
have the explicit hashtag. 30% of the top-250
ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis
shows that sarcasm is often signalled by hy-
perbole, using intensifiers and exclamations;
in contrast, non-hyperbolic sarcastic messages
often receive an explicit marker. We hypothe-
size that explicit markers such as hashtags are
the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non-
verbal expressions that people employ in live
interaction when conveying sarcasm.
1 Introduction
In the general area of sentiment analysis, sarcasm
plays a role as an interfering factor that can flip the
polarity of a message. Unlike a simple negation, a
sarcastic message typically conveys a negative opin-
ion using only positive words ? or even intensified
positive words. The detection of sarcasm is there-
fore important, if not crucial, for the development
and refinement of sentiment analysis systems, but
is at the same time a serious conceptual and tech-
nical challenge. In this paper we introduce a sar-
casm detection system for tweets, messages on the
microblogging service offered by Twitter.1
In doing this we are helped by the fact that sar-
casm appears to be a well-understood concept by
Twitter users, as seen by the relatively accurate use
of an explicit marker of sarcasm, the hashtag ?#sar-
casm?. Hashtags in messages on Twitter (tweets) are
explicitly marked keywords, and often act as cate-
gorical labels or metadata in addition to the body
text of the tweet. By using the explicit hashtag any
remaining doubt a reader may have is taken away:
the message is intended as sarcastic.
In communication studies, sarcasm has been
widely studied, often in relation with, or encom-
passed by concepts such as irony as a broader cate-
gory term, and in particular in relation with (or syn-
onymous to) verbal irony. A brief overview of def-
initions, hypotheses and findings from communica-
tion studies regarding sarcasm and verbal irony may
help clarify what the hashtag ?#sarcasm? conveys.
1.1 Definitions
Many researchers treat irony and sarcasm as
strongly related (Attardo, 2007; Brown, 1980; Gibbs
and O?Brien, 1991; Kreuz and Roberts, 1993;
Muecke, 1969; Mizzau, 1984), and sometimes even
equate the terms in their studies in order to work
with an usable definition (Grice, 1978; Tsur et al,
2010). We are interested in sarcasm as a linguistic
phenomenon, and how we can detect it in social me-
1http://www.twitter.com
29
dia messages. Yet, Brown (1980) warns that sarcasm
?is not a discrete logical or linguistic phenomenon?
(p. 111), while verbal irony is; we take the liberty
of using the term sarcasm while verbal irony would
be the more appropriate term. Even then, according
to Gibbs and Colston (2007) the definition of ver-
bal irony is still a ?problem that surfaces in the irony
literature? (p. 584).
There are many different theoretical approaches
to verbal irony. Burgers (2010), who provides an
overview of approaches, distinguishes a number of
features in ironic utterances that need to be included
in an operational definition of irony: (1) irony is al-
ways implicit (Giora, 1995; Grice, 1978), (2) irony
is evaluative (Attardo, 2000; Kotthoff, 2003; Sper-
ber and Wilson, 1995), it is possible to (3) distin-
guish between a non-ironic and an ironic reading of
the same utterance (Grice, 1975; Grice, 1978), (4)
between which a certain type of opposition may be
observed (see also Kawakami, 1984, 1988, summa-
rized in (Hamamoto, 1998; Partington, 2007; Seto,
1998). Burgers? own definition of verbal irony is ?an
evaluative utterance, the valence of which is implic-
itly reversed between the literal and intended evalu-
ation? (Burgers, 2010, p. 19).
Thus, a sarcastic utterance involves a shift in eval-
uative valence, which can go two ways: it could be
a shift from a literally positive to an intended neg-
ative meaning, or a shift from a literally negative
to an intended positive evaluation. Since Reyes et
al. (2012b) also argue that users of social media of-
ten use irony in utterances that involve a shift in
evaluative valence, we use Burgers? (2010) defini-
tion of verbal irony in this study on sarcasm, and
we use both terms synonymously. The definition of
irony as saying the opposite of what is meant is com-
monly used in previous corpus-analytic studies, and
is reported to be reliable (Kreuz et al, 1996; Leigh,
1994; Srinarawat, 2005).
Irony is used relatively often in dialogic interac-
tion. Around 8% of conversational turns between
American college friends contains irony (Gibbs,
2007). According to Gibbs (2007), group members
use irony to ?affirm their solidarity by directing com-
ments at individuals who are not group members and
not deemed worthy of group membership? (p. 341).
When an individual sees a group?s normative stan-
dards violated, he uses sarcasm to vent frustration.
Sarcasm is also used when someone finds a situa-
tion or object offensive (Gibbs, 2007). Sarcasm or
irony is always directed at someone or something;
its target. A target is the person or object against
whom or which the ironic utterance is directed (Liv-
nat, 2004). Targets can be the sender himself, the
addressee or a third party (or a combination of the
three). Burgers (2010) showed that in Dutch written
communication, the target of the ironic utterance is
often a third party. These findings may be interest-
ing for our research, in which we study microtexts
of up to 140 characters from Twitter.
Sarcasm in written and spoken interaction may
work differently (Jahandarie, 1999). In spoken in-
teraction, sarcasm is often marked with a special
intonation (Attardo et al, 2003; Bryant and Tree,
2005; Rockwell, 2007) or an incongruent facial ex-
pression (Muecke, 1978; Rockwell, 2003; Attardo
et al, 2003). Burgers (2010) argues that in writ-
ten communication, authors do not have clues like ?a
special intonation? or ?an incongruent facial expres-
sion? at their disposal. Since sarcasm is more diffi-
cult to comprehend than a literal utterance (Gibbs,
1986; Giora, 2003; Burgers, 2010), it is likely that
addressees do not pick up on the sarcasm and in-
terpret the utterances literally. Acoording to Gibbs
and Izett (2005), sarcasm divides its addressees into
two groups; a group of people who understand sar-
casm (the so-called group of wolves) and a group
of people who do not understand sarcasm (the so-
called group of sheep). In order to ensure that the ad-
dressees detect the sarcasm in the utterance, senders
use linguistic markers in their utterances. According
to Attardo (2000) those markers are clues a writer
can give that ?alert a reader to the fact that a sen-
tence is ironical? (p. 7). On Twitter, the hashtag
?#sarcasm? is a popular marker.
1.2 Intensifiers
There are sarcastic utterances which would still be
qualified as sarcastic when all markers were re-
moved from it (Attardo et al, 2003), for example
the use of a hyperbole (Kreuz and Roberts, 1995).
It may be that a sarcastic utterance with a hyper-
bole (?fantastic weather? when it rains) is identi-
fied as sarcastic with more ease than a sarcastic ut-
terance without a hyperbole (?the weather is good?
when it rains). While both utterances convey a lit-
30
erally positive attitude towards the weather, the ut-
terance with the hyperbolic ?fantastic? may be eas-
ier to interpret as sarcastic than the utterance with
the non-hyperbolic ?good?. Such hyperbolic words
which strengthen the evaluative utterance are called
intensifiers. Bowers (1964) defines language inten-
sity as ?the quality of language which indicates the
degree to which the speaker?s attitude toward a con-
cept deviates from neutrality? (p. 416). According
to Van Mulken and Schellens (2012), an intensifier
is a linguistic element that can be removed or re-
placed while respecting the linguistic correctness of
the sentence and context, but resulting in a weaker
evaluation. A commonly used way to intensify ut-
terances is by using word classes such as adverbs
(?very?) or adjectives (?fantastic? instead of ?good?).
It may be that senders use such intensifiers in their
tweets to make the utterance hyperbolic and thereby
sarcastic, without using a linguistic marker such as
?#sarcasm?.
1.3 Outline
In this paper we describe the design and imple-
mentation of a sarcasm detector that marks unseen
tweets as being sarcastic or not. We analyse the pre-
dictive performance of the classifier by testing its ca-
pacity on test tweets that are explicitly marked with
the hashtag #sarcasme (Dutch for ?sarcasm?), left
out during testing, and its capacity to rank likely sar-
castic tweets that do not have the #sarcasme mark.
We also provide a qualitative linguistic analysis of
the features that the classifier thinks are the most
discriminative. In a further qualitative analysis of
sarcastic tweets in the test set we find that the use
of an explicit hashtag marking sarcasm occurs rela-
tively often without other indicators of sarcasm such
as intensifiers or exclamations.
2 Related Research
The automatic classification of communicative con-
structs in short texts has become a widely researched
subject in recent years. Large amounts of opinions,
status updates and personal expressions are posted
on social media platforms such as Twitter. The au-
tomatic labeling of their polarity (to what extent a
text is positive or negative) can reveal, when aggre-
gated or tracked over time, how the public in gen-
eral thinks about certain things. See Montoyo et al
(2012) for an overview of recent research in senti-
ment analyis and opinion mining.
A major obstacle for automatically determining
the polarity of a (short) text are constructs in which
the literal meaning of the text is not the intended
meaning of the sender, as many systems for the de-
tection of polarity primarily lean on positive and
negative words as markers. The task to identify
such constructs can improve polarity classification,
and provide new insights into the relatively new
genre of short messages and microtexts on social
media. Previous works describe the classification
of irony (Reyes et al, 2012b), sarcasm (Tsur et al,
2010), satire (Burfoot and Baldwin, 2009), and hu-
mor (Reyes et al, 2012a).
Most common to our research are the works by
Reyes et al (2012b) and Tsur et al (2010). Reyes et
al. (2012b) collect a training corpus of irony based
on tweets that consist of the hashtag #irony in order
to train classifiers on different types of features (sig-
natures, unexpectedness, style and emotional sce-
narios) and try to distinguish #irony-tweets from
tweets containing the hashtags #education, #hu-
mour, or #politics, achieving F1-scores of around
70. Tsur et al (2010) focus on product reviews on
the World Wide Web, and try to identify sarcastic
sentences from these in a semi-supervised fashion.
Training data is collected by manually annotating
sarcastic sentences, and retrieving additional train-
ing data based on the annotated sentences as queries.
Sarcasm is annotated on a scale from 1 to 5. As fea-
tures, Tsur et al look at the patterns in these sen-
tences, consisting of high-frequency words and con-
tent words. Their system achieves an F1-score of 79
on a testset of product reviews, after extracting and
annotating a sample of 90 sentences classified as sar-
castic and 90 sentences classified as not sarcastic.
In the two works described above, a system is
tested in a controlled setting: Reyes et al (2012b)
compare irony to a restricted set of other topics,
while Tsur et al (2010) took from the unlabeled
test set a sample of product reviews with 50% of
the sentences classified as sarcastic. In contrast, we
apply a trained sarcasm detector to a real-world test
set representing a realistically large sample of tweets
posted on a specific day of which the vast majority is
not sarcastic. Detecting sarcasm in social media is,
31
arguably, a needle-in-a-haystack problem (of the 3.3
million tweets we gathered on a single day, 135 are
explicitly marked with the hashtag #sarcasm), and it
is only reasonable to test a system in the context of a
typical distribution of sarcasm in tweets. Like in the
research of (Reyes et al, 2012b), we train a classifier
based on tweets with a specific hashtag.
3 Experimental Setup
3.1 Data
For the collection of tweets for this study we make
use of a database provided by the Netherlands e-
Science Centre, consisting of a substantial portion
of all Dutch tweets posted from December 2010 on-
wards.2 From this database, we collected all tweets
that contained the marker ?#sarcasme?, the Dutch
word for sarcasm with the hashtag prefix. This re-
sulted in a set of 77,948 tweets. We also collected
all tweets posted on a single day, namely February
1, 2013.3 This set of tweets contains approximately
3,3 million tweets, of which 135 carry the hashtag
#sarcasme.
3.2 Winnow classification
Both the collected tweets with a #sarcasme hash-
tag and the tweets that were posted on a single day
were tokenized and stripped of punctuation. Capi-
tals were not removed, as they might be used to sig-
nal sarcasm (Burgers, 2010). We made use of word
uni-, bi- and trigrams as features. Terms that oc-
curred three times or less or in two tweets or less in
the whole set were removed, as well as the hashtag
#sarcasme. Features were weighted by the ?2 met-
ric.
As classification algorithm we made use of Bal-
anced Winnow (Littlestone, 1988) as implemented
in the Linguistic Classification System.4 This algo-
rithm is known to offer state-of-the-art results in text
classification, and produces interpretable per-class
weights that can be used to, for example, inspect
the highest-ranking features for one class label. The
? and ? parameters were set to 1,05 and 0,95 re-
spectively. The major threshold (?+) and the minor

3All tweets from February 1, 2013 onwards were removed
from the set of sarcasm tweets.
4http://www.phasar.cs.ru.nl/LCS/
threshold (??) were set to 2,5 and 0,5. The number
of iterations was bounded to a maximum of three.
3.3 Experiment
In order to train the classifier on distinctive features
of sarcasm in tweets, we combined the set of 78
thousand sarcasm tweets with a random sample of
other tweets posted on February 1, 2013 as back-
ground corpus. We made sure the background cor-
pus did not contain any of the 135 explicitly marked
sarcasm tweets posted that day. As the size of a
background corpus can influence the performance of
the classifier (in doubt, a classifier will be biased by
the skew of the distribution of classes in the training-
data), we performed a comparitive experiment with
two distributions between sarcasm-labeled tweets
and background tweets: in the first variant, the di-
vision between the two is 50%?50%, in the second,
25% of the tweets are sarcasm-labeled, and 75% are
background.
4 Results
To evaluate the outcome of our machine learning ex-
periment, we ran two evaluations. The first evalu-
ation focuses on the 135 tweets with explicit #sar-
casme hastags posted on February 1, 2013. We mea-
sured how well these tweets were identified using
the true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR,
also known as recall), and their joint score, the area
under the curve (AUC). AUC is a common evalua-
tion metric that is argued to be more resistant to skew
than F-score, due to using TPR rather than precision
(Fawcett, 2004). Results are displayed in Table 1.
The first evaluation, on the variant with a balanced
distribution of the two classes, leads to a retrieval of
101 of the 135 sarcasm-tweets (75%), while nearly
500 thousand tweets outside of these were also clas-
sified as being sarcastic. When a quarter of the train-
ing tweets has a sarcasm label, a smaller amount of
76 sarcasm tweets are retrieved. The AUC scores for
the two ratios indicates that the 50%?50% balance
leads to the highest AUC score (0.79) for sarcasm.
Our subsequent analyses are based on the outcomes
when using this distribution in training.
Besides generating an absolute winner-take-all
classification, our Balanced Winnow classifier also
assigns scores to each label that can be seen as its

confidence in that label. We can rank its predictions
by the classifier?s confidence on the ?sarcasm? la-
bel and inspect manually which of the top-ranking
tweets is indeed sarcastic. We generated a list of the
250 most confident ?sarcasm?-labeled tweets. Three
annotators (the authors of this paper) made a judge-
ment for these tweets as being either sarcastic or not.
In order to test for intercoder reliability, Cohen?s
Kappa was used. In line with Siegel and Castellan
(1988), we calculated a mean Kappa based on pair-
wise comparisons of all possible coder pairs. The
mean intercoder reliability between the three possi-
ble coder pairs is substantial (? = .79).
When taking the majority vote of the three an-
notators as the golden label, a curve of the preci-
sion at all points in the ranking can be plotted. This
curve is displayed in Figure 1. As can be seen, the
overall performance is poor (the average precision
is 0.30). After peaking at 0.50 after 22 tweets, pre-
cision slowly decreases when descending to lower
rankings. During the first five tweets, the curve is at
0.0; these tweets, receiving the highest overall con-
fidence scores, are relatively short and contain one
strong sarcasm feature in the classifier without any
negative feature.
5 Analysis
Our first closer analysis of our results concerns the
reliability of the user-generated hastag #sarcasme as
a golden label, as Twitter users cannot all be as-
sumed to be experts in sarcasm or understand what
sarcasm is. The three annotators who annotated the
ranked classifier output also coded a random sam-
ple of 250 tweets with the #sarcasme hashtag from
the training set. The average score of agreement be-
tween the three possible coder pairs turned out to be
moderate (? = .54). Taking the majority vote over
Figure 1: Precision at {1 . . . 250} on the sarcasm class
the three annotations as the reference labeling, 85%
(212) of the 250 annotated #sarcasme tweets were
found to be sarcastic.
While the classifier performance gives an impres-
sion of its ability to distinguish sarcastic tweets, the
strong indicators of sarcasm as discovered by the
classifier may provide additional insight into the us-
age of sarcasm by Twitter users: in particular, the
typical targets of sarcasm, and the different linguis-
tic markers that are used. We thus set out to ana-
lyze the feature weights assigned by the Balanced
Winnow classifier ranked by the strength of their
connection to the sarcasm label, taking into account
the 500 words and n-grams with the highest positive
weight towards the sarcasm class. These words and
n-grams provide insight into the topics Twitter users
are talking about: their targets. People often talk
about school and related subjects such as homework,
books, exams, classes (French, chemistry, physics),
teachers, the school picture, sports day, and (return-
ing from) vacation. Another popular target of sar-
33
casm is the weather: the temperature, rain, snow,
and sunshine. Apart from these two common top-
ics, people tend to be sarcastic about social media
itself, holidays, public transport, soccer, television
programs (The Voice of Holland), celebrities (Justin
Bieber), the church, the dentist and vacuum clean-
ing. Many of these topics are indicative of the young
age, on average, of Twitter users.
The strongest linguistic markers of sarcastic ut-
terances are markers that can be seen as syn-
onyms for #sarcasme, such as sarcasme (without
#), #ironie and ironie (irony), #cynisme and cynisme
(cynicism), or words that are strongly related to
those concepts by marking the opposite of the ex-
pressed utterance: #humor, #LOL, #joke (grapje),
and #NOT.
Second, the utterances contain much positive ex-
clamations that make the utterance hyperbolic and
thereby sarcastic. Examples of those markers in
Dutch are (with and without # and/or capitals): jip-
pie, yes, goh, joepie, jeej, jeuj, yay, woehoe, and
wow.
We suspected that the sarcastic utterances con-
tained intensifiers to make the tweets hyperbolic.
The list of strongest predictors show that some inten-
sifiers are indeed strong predictors of sarcasm, such
as geweldig (awesome), heerlijk (lovely), prachtig
(wonderful), natuurlijk (of course), gelukkig (for-
tunately), zoooo (soooo), allerleukste (most fun),
fantastisch (fantastic), and heeel (veeery). Besides
these intensifiers many unmarked positive words oc-
cur in the list of strongest predictors as well, such
as fijn (nice), gezellig (cozy), leuk (fun), origi-
neel (original), slim (smart), favoriet (favorite), nut-
tig (useful), and chill. Considerably less negative
words occur as strong predictors. This supports our
hypothesis that the utterances are mostly positive,
while the opposite meaning is meant. This find-
ing corresponds with the results of Burgers (2010),
who show that 77% of the ironic utterances in Dutch
communication are literally positive.
To inspect whether sarcastic tweets are always in-
tensified to be hyperbolic, we need to further analyse
the sarcastic tweets our classifier correctly identifies.
Analyzing the 76 tweets that our classifier correctly
identifies in the top-250 tweets the classifier rates as
sarcastic, we see that intensifiers do not dominate
in occurrence; supporting numbers are listed in Ta-

ble 2. About one in three sarcastic tweets, 34.2%,
are not hyperbolic at all: they are only explicitly
marked, most of the times with a hashtag. A major-
ity of 59.2% of the tweets does contain hyperbole-
inducing elements, such as an intensifier or an ex-
clamation, or combinations of these elements. A full
combination of explicit markers, intensifiers, and ex-
clamations only rarely occurs, however (2.6%). The
three categories of predictive word types do cover
93.4% of the tweets.
6 Conclusion
In this study we developed and tested a system that
detects sarcastic tweets in a realistic sample of 3.3
million Dutch tweets posted on a single day, trained
on a set of nearly 78 thousand tweets, harvested
over time, marked by the hashmark #sarcasme by
the senders. The classifier is able to correctly detect
101 of the 135 tweets among the 3.3 million that
were explicitly marked with the hashtag, with the
hashtag removed. Testing the classifier on the top
250 of the tweets it ranked as most likely to be sar-
castic, it attains only a 30% average precision. We
can conclude that it is fairly hard to distinguish sar-
castic tweets from literal tweets in an open setting,
though the top of the classifier?s ranking does iden-
tify many sarcastic tweets which were not explicitly
marked with a hashtag.
An additional linguistic analysis provides some
insights into the characteristics of sarcasm on Twit-
ter. We found that most tweets contain a literally
34
positive message, take common teenager topics as
target (school, homework, family life) and further
contain three types of words: explicit markers (the
word sarcasme and pseudo-synonyms, with or with-
out the hashmark #), intensifiers, and exclamations.
The latter two categories of words induce hyper-
bole, but together they only occur in about 60%
of sarcastic tweets; in 34% of the cases, sarcastic
tweets are not hyperbolic, but only have an explicit
marker, most of which hashtags. This indicates that
the hashtag can and does replace linguistic markers
that otherwise would be needed to mark sarcasm.
Arguably, extralinguistic elements such as hashtags
can be seen as the social media equivalent of non-
verbal expressions that people employ in live inter-
action when conveying sarcasm. As Burgers (2010)
show, the more explicit markers an ironic utterance
contains, the better the utterance is understood, the
less its perceived complexity is, and the better it is
rated. Many Twitter users already seem to apply this
knowledge.
Although in this research we focused on the
Dutch language, our findings may also apply to lan-
guages similar to Dutch, such as English and Ger-
man. Future research would be needed to chart the
prediction of sarcasm in languages that are more dis-
tant to Dutch. Sarcasm may be used differently in
other cultures (Goddard, 2006). Languages may use
the same type of marker in different ways, such as
a different intonation in spoken sarcasm by English
and Cantonese speakers (Cheang and Pell, 2009).
Such a difference between languages in the use of
the same marker may also apply to written sarcastic
utterances.
Another strand of future research would be to ex-
pand our scope from sarcasm to other more sub-
tle variants of irony, such as understatements, eu-
phemisms, and litotes. Based on Giora et al (2005),
there seems to be a spectrum of degrees of irony
from the sarcastic ?Max is exceptionally bright? via
the ironic ?Max is not exceptionally bright?, the un-
derstatement ?Max is not bright? to the literal ?Max
is stupid?. In those utterances, there is a gap between
what is literally said and the intended meaning of the
sender. The greater the gap or contrast, the easier it
is to perceive the irony. But the negated not bright
is still perceived as ironic; more ironic than the lit-
eral utterance (Giora et al, 2005). We may need to
combine the sarcasm detection task with the prob-
lem of the detection of negation and hedging mark-
ers and their scope (Morante et al, 2008; Morante
and Daelemans, 2009) in order to arrive at a compre-
hensive account of polarity-reversing mechanisms,
which in sentiment analysis is still highly desirable.

Abstract
Hashtags in Twitter posts may carry dif-
ferent semantic payloads. Their dual form
(word and label) may serve to categorize
the tweet, but may also add content to the
message, or strengthen it. Some hash-
tags are related to emotions. In a study
on emotional hashtags in Dutch Twitter
posts we employ machine learning classi-
fiers to test to what extent tweets that are
stripped from their hashtag could be re-
assigned to this hashtag. About half of the
24 tested hashtags can be predicted with
AUC scores of .80 or higher. However,
when we apply the three best-performing
classifiers to unseen tweets that do not
carry the hashtag but might have carried
it according to human annotators, the clas-
sifiers manage to attain a precision-at-250
of .7 for only two of the hashtags. We ob-
serve that some hashtags are predictable
from their tweets, and strengthen the emo-
tion already expressed in the tweets. Other
hashtags are added to messages that do not
predict them, presumably to provide emo-
tional information that was not yet in the
tweet.
1 Introduction
Since the launch of Twitter in 2006 the microblog-
ging service has proven to be a valuable source of
research on the linguistic expression of sentiment
and affect. Sentiments and emotions are impor-
tant aspects of status updates and conversations in
Twitter messages (Ritter et al., 2010; Dann, 2010).
Many Twitter messages (tweets) express an emo-
tion of the sender: according to Roberts et al.
(2012), 43 percent of the 7,000 tweets they col-
lected are an emotional expression. Automatically
detecting the emotion in tweets is key to under-
stand the sentiment underlying real world events
and topics.
Potentially, Twitter offers a vast amount of data
to exploit for the construction of computational
models able to detect certain sentiments or emo-
tions in unseen tweets. Yet, in the typical scenario
of applying supervised machine learning classi-
fiers, some annotation effort will be required to
label sentiments and emotions reliably. Currently
there are two main approaches to labeling tweets.
The first is the annotation of data by human ex-
perts (Alm et al., 2005; Aman and Szpakowicz,
2007). This approach is known to result in high-
precision annotated data, but is labor-intensive and
time-consuming.
The second approach is to use the annotations
that Twitter users themselves add to a tweet: hash-
tags. A hashtag (a word prefixed by the typograph-
ical hashmark #) is an explicitly marked keyword
that may also serve as a word in the context of
the other non-tagged words of the post. The us-
age of a hashtag in Twitter serves many purposes
beyond mere categorization, most of which are
conversational (Huang et al., 2010). Hashtags ex-
pressing emotions are often used in tweets and are
therefore potentially useful annotations for train-
ing data. Wang et al. (2012) state that annotating
interpretative labels by humans other than the au-
thor is not as reliable as having the data annotated
by the author himself. As far as emotions can be
self-observed and self-reported, authors arguably
have the best information about their own emo-
tions. Following Gonz?alez-Ib?a?nez et al. (2011),
Mohammad (2012) presents several experiments
to validate that the emotional labels in tweets are
consistent and match intuitions of trained judges.
Therefore, using hashtags as annotated training
data may be useful for generating emotion detec-
tors. Yet, not all hashtags are equally suitable for
this task. Even a high level of consistency and pre-
dictability in hashtag usage might not be sufficient.
26
Mohammad (2012) argues that emotion hashtags
are included in tweets by users in two different
ways. First, the hashtag can strengthen the emo-
tion already present in the tweet. By adding the
hashtag in for example ?I hate making homework
#fml? (#fml is an acronym for ?fuck my life?), the
sender reflects on his own negative message and
strengthens it with an abbreviated expletive.
Second, the hashtag can add emotion to the
message in order to avoid miscommunication.
Lacking the richness of non-verbal cues in face-to-
face communication, as well as the space to elab-
orate, attenuate, or add nuance, users of Twitter
might deploy hashtags to signify the intention or
emotion of their message. In the expression ?Mak-
ing homework #fml? for example, a Twitter user
adds sentiment to the message to clarify his nega-
tive attitude towards the described activity. Mo-
hammad (2012, p. 248) formulates the second
function of a hashtag as follows: ?reading just the
message before the hashtag does not convey the
emotions of the tweeter. Here, the hashtag pro-
vides information not present (implicitly or explic-
itly) in the rest of the message.?
Arguably, hashtags that are most often used to
add emotion to an otherwise emotionally neutral
message (the second function) will not provide
proper training data for the detection of the emo-
tion linked to the hashtag; only examples of the
first function may serve that purpose. As this in-
formation is not explicit, the suitability of a hash-
tag as an emotion label needs to be revealed in
another way. We propose an automatic method
that uses machine-learning-based text classifica-
tion. We put this method into practice for a
number of hashtags expressing emotion in Dutch
tweets. The novel contribution of this research lies
in the fact that we offer an objective, empirical
handle of the two usages of emotion hashtags as
formulated by Mohammad (2012). Furthermore,
we exemplify a new type of study that tests our
hypothesis in the realistic scenario of testing on a
full day of streaming tweets with no filtering.
2 Related research
Leveraging uncontrolled labeling to obtain large
amounts of training data is referred to as distant
supervision (Mintz et al., 2009). With its con-
ventions for hashtags as extra-linguistic markers,
Twitter is a potentially suitable platform for im-
plementing classification based on distant super-
vision. In the field of sentiment analysis, Pak
and Paroubek (2010) and Go, Bhayani and Huang
(2009) select emoticons representing positive and
negative sentiment to collect tweets with either of
the polarities. Several studies focusing on the spe-
cific task of emotion detection in Twitter also ap-
ply distant supervision. The studies in which it
is applied vary in a number of ways. First, the
type of markers by which data is collected dif-
fers. Most often only hashtags are used, occa-
sionally combined with emoticons. Davidov, Tsur
and Rappoport (2010) use hashtags and emoticons
as distinct prediction labels and find that they are
equally useful. Suttles and Ide (2013) compare the
usage of hashtags, emoticons, and emoji
1
, and find
that emoji form a valuable addition.
Second, the selection of emotions and mark-
ers differs. In many of the studies a predefined
set of emotions form the starting point for the se-
lection of markers and collection of data. Emo-
tions can be classified according to a set of basic
emotions, such as Ekman?s (Ekman, 1971) six ba-
sic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, sur-
prise, and disgust), or the bipolar emotions defined
by Plutchik?s wheel of emotions (Plutchik, 1980)
which are based on the basic emotions anger, fear,
sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and
joy. The majority of the studies rely on such cat-
egorizations (Mohammad, 2012; Suttles and Ide,
2013; Wang et al., 2012).
In spite of the interesting findings in such stud-
ies, basic emotions do not tell the whole story;
tweets may contain multiple basic emotions com-
bining into more complex emotions (Roberts et al.,
2012; Kamvar and Harris, 2011). Furthermore,
by selecting a set of hashtags that are assumed to
match the same emotion, the potential variation in
the usage of specific hashtags by users is ignored.
A different approach is to select single hashtags
expressing emotion as starting points, regardless
of their theoretical status. Davidov et.al. (2010)
select frequent hashtags from a large twitter cor-
pus and let annotators judge the strength of their
sentiment. The fifty hashtags with the strongest
sentiment are used as label. In our research, we
also single out hashtags, focusing on a set of hash-
tags that are linked to emotions, some of which are
complex.
Third, the way in which a classifier is trained
and tested differs. In some studies multi-class
1
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji
27
classification is performed, distinguishing the dif-
ferent target emotions and optionally an emotion-
ally neutral class (Purver and Battersby, 2012;
Wang et al., 2012). The multitude of classes, class
imbalance, and the possibility of single tweets
conveying multiple emotions make this a challeng-
ing task. The alternative is to train a binary clas-
sifier for each emotion (Mohammad, 2012; Qadir
and Riloff, 2013; Suttles and Ide, 2013), decid-
ing for each unseen tweet whether it conveys the
trained emotion. We apply the latter type of clas-
sification.
The fourth and final variation is the way in
which classification is evaluated. In the discussed
papers, evaluation is either performed in a ten-fold
cross-validation setting or by testing the trained
classifier on a small, manually annotated set of
tweets. We deviate from these approaches by test-
ing our classifiers on a large set of uncontrolled
tweets gathered in a single day, thereby approx-
imating the real world scenario in which emo-
tion detection is applied to the stream of incoming
tweets.
3 Approach
Our approach is to train a machine learning classi-
fier on tweets containing an emotion-bearing hash-
tag and an equal amount of random tweets as
counter-examples, resulting in a balanced binary
classifier for the hashtag (which itself is stripped
from the tweet and purely considered as a label).
The classifier is then run on a large sample of
tweets, deciding which of the tweets might fit the
target hashtag. As some of these test tweets ac-
tually contain the hashtag, a first evaluation is to
score the amount of tweets of which the hashtag
is correctly predicted by the classifier, when this
hashtag is hidden from the classifier. Second, the
tweets not containing the hashtag can be ranked
by classifier confidence for the hashtag class, af-
ter which the 250 highest ranked tweets are scored
by human annotators, who judge whether these
tweets convey the emotion that is linked to the
hashtag.
This approach is based on the assumption that
a hashtag as a label for emotion detection requires
two relations between the hashtag and the text with
which it co-occurs in tweets:
1. The context in which users include the hash-
tag is to a certain extent consistent with the
hashtag. In other words, the context (the
tweet) would predict the hashtag. If this is
the case, our classifier should score well on
the retrieval of unseen tweets containing the
hashtag (the first evaluation). Consistency
can arise from many different types of fea-
tures, ranging from topical words to emotion-
bearing words.
2. The emotion that is denoted by the hashtag
should be reflected in the words surrounding
it. Hashtags that add emotion to an otherwise
neutral message are inappropriate as annota-
tion label for emotion detection. By evalu-
ating retrieved tweets that do not contain the
hashtag on the conveyed emotion (instead of
their possible fit with the hashtag) we can
score to what extent the classifier trained a
model of the emotion in tweets successfully.
Note that hashtags that add a specific emotion to
otherwise unemotional tweets are good indicators
themselves for detecting emotion in Twitter. Our
goal, however, is to create generalizable models
of emotion in Twitter that are not restricted to the
occurrence of a hashtag.
4 Experimental setup
4.1 Data collection
As a starting point of our experiments we se-
lected 24 hashtags used in Dutch tweets. The se-
lection was inspired on a list of the 2,500 most
frequent hashtags in 2011 and 2012, generated
from twiqs.nl, a database of Dutch tweets from
December 2010 onwards (Tjong Kim Sang and
van den Bosch, 2013). Typically, emotion hash-
tags are not linked to any specific point in time,
and therefore surface in such a list generated from
an extended period of tweets.
To create the training data, tweets contain-
ing any of the hashtags were collected through
twiqs.nl from the time frame of December
2010 up and until January 2013.
We queried a large sample of Dutch tweets
(3,144,781) posted on February 1st 2013, a small
portion of which was used as negative examples
for our training data, and the rest was used as test
data.
4.2 Classification
For each of the hashtags, training data was gener-
ated by balancing the amount of collected tweets
containing the hashtag with an equal amount of
28
randomly selected tweets (not containing the hash-
tag) drawn from the set of tweets collected on
February 1st, 2013. The resulting binary classi-
fier was tested on the remainder of tweets in this
set.
The tweets were pre-processed by extracting
word unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as features.
We maintained capitalization and included punc-
tuation and emoticons as tokens in the n-grams, as
we expected such tokens to have predictive power
in the context of emotions. Both usernames and
URLs were normalized to dummy values. All fea-
tures containing a target hashtag were removed.
Classification was performed by the Balanced
Winnow algorithm (Littlestone, 1988). This algo-
rithm is known to offer state-of-the-art results in
text classification, and produces interpretable per-
class weights that can be used to, for example, in-
spect the highest-ranking features for one class la-
bel. The ? and ? parameters were set to 1,05 and
0,95 respectively. The major threshold (?+) and
the minor threshold (??) were set to 2,5 and 0,5.
The number of iterations was bounded to a maxi-
mum of three.
4.3 Evaluation
Performance was evaluated by classifying all test
tweets and counting the number of tweets with
the target hashtag that were positively classified
as such, deriving a true positive rate (recall), false
positive rate, and area under the curve (AUC)
score (Fawcett, 2004).
While this first evaluation gives an indication
of the predictability of any hashtag, the ultimate
value of a hashtag for emotion detection can be
scored by assessing the emotion in positively clas-
sified tweets that do not contain the hashtag. This
is done by manually annotating the fraction of
these tweets that are most confidently positively
ranked by the hashtag classifier, as containing the
emotion signalled by the hashtag. Three annota-
tors inspected the top-250 of these rankings.
5 Results
5.1 Hashtag predictability
The results of our classifiers labeling a large sam-
ple of tweets posted on February 1, 2013 are listed
in Table 1. Each line with a target hashtag repre-
sents a separate experiment. The amount of train-
ing tweets ranges from 19 thousand to 677 thou-
sand for the target hashtag (balanced by an equal
amount of random tweets as negative category).
The results are sorted by the AUC score.
In this first evaluation our attention focuses on
the tweets that have one of the target hashtags.
The hashtags themselves are removed at classifica-
tion time, as our goal is to measure how well our
classifiers are able to detect these ?hidden? tags.
In this particular stream of tweets, only a limited
number of tweets occur that are labeled with our
hashtags; the most frequent tag #zinin (?looking
forward to it?) occurs 1,328 times. Taking #zinin
as example, the #zinin classifier labels 158,429 of
the test tweets as likely candidates for the hashtag
#zinin. Although this is a substantial overpredic-
tion, partly caused by the 50%-50% ratio between
positive and negative cases in the training set, this
still amounts to a false positive rate of only 6%.
More importantly, of the 1,328 cases for which it
should have predicted #zinin, the classifier labels
1,186 cases correctly, attaining a true positive rate
of 89%. The area under the curve (AUC) in true
positive rate?false positive rate space is 91%.
Inspecting the performance for all 24 hashtags
we observe that about half of the hashtags obtain
an AUC of .80 or more. The influence of the
amount of training data on the AUC score seems
peripheral. Furthermore, there is no clear differ-
ence in the predictability of hashtags denoting a
positive or negative emotion. The predominantly
negative hashtags #geenzin, #fml, #balen and #ni-
etleuk obtain a high AUC, while the other nega-
tive hashtags #grr, #bah and #stom are not as pre-
dictable. There does not seem to be an a priori
property that makes a hashtag more or less pre-
dictable, indicating the need for experimentation
to confirm the usefulness of a hashtag for emotion
detection.
Interestingly, some pairs of synonymous hash-
tags (#jippie-#joepie, #wauw?#wow, #yes?#yeah,
homophonous variants of the same exclama-
tion) and antonymous hashtags (#zinin?#geenzin,
#fml?#lml) achieve similar AUC scores. This out-
come supports the validity of our approach. Syn-
onymous and antonymous hashtags are employed
in similar contexts and should therefore have a
similar predictability. This is indeed confirmed by
our results. There are counterexamples, however.
The pair #yay?#jeej exhibits dissimilar scores. In
the case of #leuk there are two antonyms: #ni-
etleuk and #stom. #leuk and #nietleuk have a dis-
similar score, while #leuk and #stom are rather

similar.
5.2 Emotion detection
The second evaluation is based on the manual an-
notation of the 250 tweets most positively ranked
by a hashtag classifier, on the emotion linked to
the target hashtag. Due to the labour-intensive na-
ture of this evaluation, it was not possible to ana-
lyze all 24 hashtags. We focused on the output for
#zinin, #geenzin, #fml and #omg. The first three
achieved the highest true positive rates ranging be-
tween 86% and 89%, and AUC scores of 90% to
91%. The latter was included as a comparison, ex-
pecting a poor emotion detection in view of its bad
predictability.
For these four hashtags the 250 ?false positives?
of which the classifier was most certain were an-
notated by the three authors by taking the binary
decision whether a tweet conveyes the emotion
presumed in tweets containing the hashtag. The
emotions most strongly linked to the four hashtags
were the following:
? #zinin: conveying anticipatory excitement;
? #geenzin: conveying uneagerness
? #fml: conveying self pity
? #omg: conveying an aroused level of indig-
nation, fear, or excitement
Note that #omg is not linked to a single emo-
tion, but rather strengthens several sorts of emo-
tions. This might have been a hampering factor
for its predictability. In the annotation for #omg
we focused on all three emotions.
Table 2 displays the precision scores when tak-
ing a simple majority decision over the three anno-
tators (67% majority) and when only counting the
cases in which all three annotators agreed (100%
majority). The outcomes show reasonably high
precision levels for #zinin (75%) and #fml (69%)
along with equally reasonable mutual F-scores be-
tween the annotators (67% for #zinin and 81% for
#fml), although Cohen?s Kappa is rather low in
some cases. On the other hand, #geenzin lags be-
hind with a majority precision of 31%. Also the
top 250 for #omg does not often display any of the
three most strongly linked emotions.
Plotting the annotations of the ranked tweets in
precision-at curves, shown in Figure 1, provides
further insight into the emotion detection quality
in relation to the confidence ranks. Precisions at
higher rank cutoffs tend to peak early (indicating
that the first top-ranked tweets fit the hashtag best),
and decrease slowly or reach a plateau.

The twofold evaluation that was employed in
this study underlines the difference between hash-
tag predictability and emotion detection. Regard-
ing the three best performing hashtags in terms
of predictability, only two, #zinin and #fml, pro-
vide utilizable data for emotion detection. Tweets
retrieved based on #geenzin seem to have a less
overt relation to the emotion of uneagerness, al-
though other cues (such as topical words indirectly
related to the emotion) lead to a fairly correct re-
covery of tweets that had the hashtag. Comparing
the two evaluations for #omg, scoring low on both,
we may assume that hashtag predictability is a re-
quirement for a proper emotion detection.
6 Discussion
6.1 Feature categories
While classifier performance gives an indication
of its ability to detect emotional tweets per hash-
tag, the strong indicators of those hashtags discov-
ered by the classifiers may provide additional in-
sight into the usage patterns of emotional hashtags
by Twitter users. Having scored the emotion de-
tection quality of four hashtags, we set out to an-
alyze the predictive features of these hashtags. To
this end we inspected the feature weights assigned
by the Balanced Winnow classifier ranked by the
strength of their connection to the emotion label,
taking into account the 150 tokens and n-grams
with the highest positive weight towards the hash-
tag.
Based on an analysis of the top 150 features
for the four hashtags, we distinguished seven cat-
egories of features: other emotion-bearing hash-
tags, emoticons, exclamations, states of being,
time expressions, topic reference, and remaining
features. Example features for each category, as
well as their share in the top 150 features for each
hashtag, are presented in Table 3. The percentages
give an impression of the most dominant types of
features in the prediction of the hashtags.
A first observation is that the top features of
the #geenzin classifier are predominantly topic re-
lated; the list hardly contains any feature that bears
emotion. This is in line with the poor perfor-
mance on the emotion detection evaluation, while
the high AUC score can be explained by a relative
consistency of the hashtag being used with topi-
cal words that have an indirect relation with the
emotion, such as homework for school. The more
accurate classifier for the opposite of #geenzin,
#zinin, uses more temporal references pointing to
the event the person is looking forward to. Also,
Dutch positive adjectives such as ?lekker? (?nice?)
and ?gezellig? (multiple translations
2
), which are
strong predictors for #zinin, add to the accuracy of
the classifier. There are no clear counterparts for
the emotion linked to the opposing #geenzin.
The percentages for #omg display the largest
shares of emotion hashtags, emoticons and ex-
clamations, confirming our impression that #omg
functions as an intensifying marker of different
emotions; this is also reflected in the high percent-
age of features in the ?other? category.
The most predictive features for the #fml clas-
sifier consist of quite some emoticons, emotional
hashtags and exclamations. Furthermore, this
classifier contains most features in the ?state of be-
ing? category, mostly relating to the complex emo-
tion of self pity.
6.2 Emotional cues in Twitter
In contrast to spoken or face-to-face communica-
tion, Twitter does not allow for the use of special
intonation or facial expressions to mark a mes-
sage. However, authors on Twitter have other cues
at their disposal. Previous studies show, for ex-
ample, that they might mark the irony or sarcasm
in their message by using linguistic markers such

and #omg (bottom right).
as hyperboles, exclamations and emoticons to help
readers to correctly interpret the message (Burgers
et al., 2012; Liebrecht et al., 2013). We argue that
this is also the case for emotional messages.
Tweets are written messages with a strongly re-
stricted length. Authors compensate the lack of
non-verbal cues by adding emotion markers. This
hypothesis is supported by research in the field
of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC),
where many studies have been carried out on (the
lack of) non-verbal emotional cues in (electronic)
messages. Walther (1992) introduced the Social
Information Processing Perspective: a theory that
users can develop relationships via CMC if they
have sufficient time and message exchanges and
if communicative cues, such as non-verbal emo-
tional cues, are available. He argues that hu-
mans easily switch between verbal and non-verbal
cues. Based on previous studies, Walther distin-
guishes textual cues that express affection: re-
lational icons (emoticons, see Asteroff, 1987),
electronic paralanguage (such as intentional mis-
spelling (veeeery), capitalization (NICE), repeti-
tion of exclamation marks (good!!!!!) and lexical
surrogates for vocal segregates (hmmm) (Carey,
1980). Later he also recognizes emoticons as
nonverbal emotion cues (Walther and D?Addario,
2001). Emoticons can serve many purposes, one
of which is expressing emotions (Agarwal et al.,
2011; Davidov et al., 2010).
7 Conclusion
In our experiments we showed that machine learn-
ing classifiers can be relatively successful both
in predicting the hashtag with tweets which were
indeed tagged with them, and classifying tweets
without the hashtag as exhibiting the emotion de-
noted by the hashtag, for two of the four fully anal-
ysed hashtags: #zinin and #fml. In contrast, the
classifier of the hashtag #geenzin was only able
to re-link tweets that are stripped from the target
hashtag with this hashtag, but failed to capture the
complex emotion behind the hashtag. The perfor-
mance of the #omg classifier lags behind in both
tasks.
These findings can be explained by the assump-
tion we made that in order to be a proper emotion
label, the context of the hashtag (the rest of the

tweet) would need to convey the same emotion
as the hashtag. This appears to be the case with
#zinin and #fml. We may assume that the message
in tweets with #zinin or #fml carries the emotion
itself, which is intensified by the hashtag. The al-
ternative relation between the hashtag and the text
is that a hashtag adds emotion to an otherwise neu-
tral message: a signalling function. It seems that
most of the tweets tagged with #geenzin are ex-
amples of this second relation. The classifier per-
formed well at the re-link task, indicating that it
was able to exploit the consistent use of predic-
tive words and phrases, but less well as an emotion
detector when we applied the classifier to unseen
tweets that do not carry the hashtag. The topical
words the classifier used as predictive features ap-
pear to be used in several other settings in which
no emotion is conveyed, or different emotions than
the one expressed by #geenzin. The fourth hash-
tag that was fully analysed, #omg, turned out to
be overall difficult for our classifier. We defined
#omg as conveying an aroused level of indigna-
tion, fear or excitement. In comparison to the other
three hashtags, this definition is less strictly linked
to one emotion (Kim et al., 2012). Rather, the
hashtag is used in the context of three different
emotions and is in itself not an emotion, but an
emotion intensifier. Possibly, as a result thereof
the tweets are more diverse and the hashtag #omg
occurs more frequently with other linguistic ele-
ments to express emotion, such as emotional hash-
tags, emoticons and exclamations.
Although time restrictions prevented us from
performing a similar analysis of more hashtags,
we can conclude that hashtag predictability is
fairly high for most of the 24 hashtags in our
set. Interestingly, a considerate part of the syn-
onymous and antonymous hashtags led to similar
scores, indicating a relationship between the type
of emotion conveyed by a hashtag and the degree
of consistency by which the hashtag is employed
by users. Whether the degree of consistency, along
with an intensifying or emotion adding deploy-
ment, can be deduced from the inherent properties
of an emotion hashtag is open for future research.
