Abstract1 
While large-scale corpora and various 
corpus query tools have long been recog-
nized as essential language resources, the 
value of word association norms as lan-
guage resources has been largely over-
looked. This paper conducts some initial 
comparisons of the lexical relationships 
observed within Japanese collocation da-
ta extracted from a large corpus using the 
Japanese language version of the Sketch 
Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanovi? et al, 
2008) and the relationships found within 
Japanese word association sets taken 
from the large-scale Japanese Word As-
sociation Database (JWAD) under ongo-
ing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007). 
The comparison results indicate that 
while some relationships are common to 
both linguistic resources, many lexical 
relationships are only observed in one re-
source. These findings suggest that both 
resources are necessary in order to more 
adequately cover the diverse range of 
lexical relationships. Finally, the paper 
reflects briefly on the implementation of 
association-based word-search strategies 
into electronic dictionaries proposed by 
Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006). 
1 Introduction 
Large-scale corpora and various corpus query 
tools have long been recognized as extremely 
important language resources. The impact of

corpora and corpus query tools has been particu-
larly significant in the area of compiling and de-
veloping lexicographic materials (Kilgarriff and 
Rundell, 2002) and in the area of creating various 
kinds of lexical resources, such as WordNet 
(Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Atkins et al, 
2003; Fillmore et al, 2003). 
In contrast, although the significance of data-
bases of free word association norms have long 
been recognized within psychology in providing 
insights into higher cognitive processes (Cramer, 
1968; Deese, 1965; Nelson et al, 1998; Steyvers 
and Tenenbaum, 2005), their value as a language 
resource has been largely overlooked. However, 
as Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) point out, 
databases of word association norms represent an 
extremely useful supplement to the range of tra-
ditional language resources, such as large-scale 
corpora, thesauri, and dictionaries, and can po-
tentially contribute greatly to the development of 
more sophisticated linguistic resources. 
This paper seeks to demonstrate the potential 
value of word association databases as language 
resources. Specifically, we conduct some initial 
comparisons of the lexical relationships observed 
within Japanese collocation data, as extracted 
from a large corpus with the Japanese language 
version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool 
(Srdanovi? et al, 2008), with those found within 
Japanese word association sets, which were 
created through the ongoing construction of the 
large-scale Japanese Word Association Database 
(JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2007). Interesting similar-
ities and differences between the two language 
resources in terms of captured lexical relation-
ships affirm the value of word association data-
bases as rich linguistic resources. In concluding, 
we speculate briefly on how the wider range of 
lexical relationships identifiable through the 
combination of collocation data and word associ-
1
ation databases could be utilized in organizing 
lexical entries within electronic dictionaries in 
ways that are cognitively salient. While we fully 
acknowledge that the challenges involved are 
formidable ones (Zock, 2006), the principled in-
corporation of word association knowledge with-
in electronic dictionaries could greatly facilitate 
the development of more flexible and user-
friendly navigation and search strategies (Zock 
and Bilac, 2004). 
2 Basic Concepts: Word Sketches and 
Word Association Norms 
This section briefly provides some background 
information about SkE, which is the corpus 
query tool used in this study to extract and dis-
play word collocation data, and about word asso-
ciation norms as gathered through psychological 
experimentation. 
2.1 Sketch Engine (SkE): Word Sketches 
and Thesaurus Tools 
Sketch Engine (SkE) (Kilgarriff et al 2004) is a 
web-based corpus query tool that supports a 
number of functions. These include fast concor-
dancing, grammatical processing, ?word sketch-
ing? (one-page summaries of a word?s grammati-
cal and collocation behavior), a distributional 
thesaurus, and robot use. SkE has been applied to 
a number of languages. In this study, we utilize 
the Word Sketches and Thesaurus functions for 
the Japanese language. As both tools process raw 
collocation data by organizing words according 
to grammatical and lexical relationships, they are 
particularly suited to the conducted comparisons 
with the word association data. 
Word Sketches (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001) 
present the most frequent and statistically-salient 
collocations and grammatical relations for a giv-
en word. These relations are derived as the re-
sults of grammatical analysis (a gramrel file) that 
employs regular expressions over PoS-tags. 
The distributional thesaurus groups together 
words that occur in similar contexts and have 
common collocation words. Estimations of se-
mantic similarity are based on ?shared triples?. 
For example, <read a book> and <read a maga-
zine> share the same triple pattern of <read a ?>, 
and because ?book? and ?magazine? exhibit high 
salience for the triple, they are both assumed to 
belong to the same thesaurus category. This ap-
proach is similar to conventional techniques for 
automatic thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998). 
2.2 Word Association Norms 
In contrast to the Word Sketch collocation and 
thesaurus tools that take the corpus as the basic 
input language resource, databases of word asso-
ciation norms are the results of psychological 
experiments. The free word association task typi-
cally asks the respondent to respond with the first 
semantically-related word that comes to mind on 
presentation of a stimulus word. 
The collection of word association normative 
data can be traced back to the seminal study by 
Kent and Rosanoff (1910) which gathered word 
association responses for a list of 100 stimulus 
words. However, despite the insightful remarks 
of Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) that word 
associations closely mirror the structured patterns 
of relations that exist among concepts?claims 
that undoubtedly warrant further investigation?
there are, unfortunately, still relatively few large-
scale databases of word association norms. The 
notable exceptions for the English language in-
clude the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus 
(EAT) (Kiss et al, 1973), which consists of ap-
proximately 56,000 responses to a stimulus list 
of 8,400 words, and the University of South Flor-
ida Word Association, Rhyme, and Word Frag-
ment Norms compiled by Nelson et al (1998), 
consisting of nearly three-quarters of a million 
responses to 5,019 stimulus words. Another da-
tabase deserving mention is the Russian Associa-
tion Thesaurus compiled by Karaulov et al 
(1994, 1996, 1998) which has approximately 
23,000 responses for 8,000 stimulus words (cited 
in Sinopalnikova and Pavel, 2004). 
3 Japanese Language Resources 
This section introduces the Japanese language 
resources utilized in this study: namely, the Jap-
anese Word Sketches and Thesaurus (Srdanovi? 
et al, 2008) and the Japanese Word Association 
Database (Joyce, 2005, 2007). 
3.1 Japanese Word Sketches and Thesaurus 
The Japanese version of SkE is based on JpWaC 
(Erjavec et al, 2007; Srdanovi? et al, 2008), 
which is a 400-million word Japanese web cor-
pus that has been morphologically analyzed and 
POS-tagged with the ChaSen tool 
(http://chasen.naist.jp/). The Word Sketches are 
based on Japanese grammatical analysis results 
(gramrel file), where 22 grammatical relations 
are defined based on ChaSen PoS tags and to-
kens (Srdanovi? et al2008). Figure 1 presents 
2
parts of word sketches for the noun fuyu (? win-
ter), showing adjective modifications and two 
verb relations involving the particles of wa (?
topic marker) and ni (? time marker), respec-
tively.

noun fuyu (? winter). 
3.2 Japanese Word Association Database 
To an even greater extent than for the English 
language, there has been a serious lack of word 
association norms for the Japanese language. 
While Umemoto?s (1969) survey collected asso-
ciations from 1,000 university students, the li-
mited set of just 210 words merely underscores 
the deficient. More recently, Okamoto and Ishi-
zaki (2001) compiled an Associative Concept 
Dictionary (ACD) consisting of 33,018 word 
association responses provided by 10 respon-
dents for 1,656 nouns. However, it should be 
noted that the ACD is not strictly free association 
data because response category was specified as 
part of the task. 
Under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005, 
2007), the Japanese Word Association Database 
(JWAD) aims to eventually develop into a very 
large-scale database of free word association 
norms for the Japanese language in terms of both 
the number of stimulus items and the numbers of 
association responses collected. The present 
JWAD stimulus list consists of 5,000 basic Japa-
nese kanji and words. The currently available 
JWAD Version 1 (JWAD-V1) consists of 
104,800 free word association responses col-
lected through a paper questionnaire survey with 
a sample of 2,099 items presented to up to 50 
respondents. The association sets compared with 
work sketch profiles in the subsequent sections 
are from JWAD-V1. 
4 Conducted Comparisons 
This section presents the results of our initial 
comparison for the lexical relationships observed 
within the Japanese collocation data with those in 
the Japanese word association sets. The compari-
sons focused on approximately 350 word associ-
ation responses constituting the association sets 
for the two verbs of kizuku (??? to notice) 
and sagasu (?? to search for), the adjective of 
omoshiroi (???  interesting), and the three 
nouns of jitensha (???  bicycle), natsu (? 
summer), and yama (? mountain), as examples 
of basic Japanese vocabulary. Taking into ac-
count the considerable degree of orthographic 
variation present with the Japanese writing sys-
tem, all possible orthographic variations were 
searched for in the SkE, such as kizuku (???/
???) and omoshiroi (???/?????). 
4.1 Word Sketches and Thesaurus Versus 
Word Association Norms 
The Japanese SkE employs a large-scale Japa-
nese corpus and detailed grammatical analysis 
based on ChaSen POS tags. Accordingly, nu-
merous lexical relationships are identified in the 
word sketches and thesaurus results. For example, 
kizuku appears 12,134 times in the corpus in ap-
proximately 200 collocation examples in total, 
which are grouped under 12 different collocation 
and grammatical relations and sorted according 
to the statistical salience of the relation?s fre-
quency within the corpus (note that searches 
were conducted with the default setting of only 
including collocations with frequencies of five or 
more). The thesaurus function also yields numer-
ous results, typically displaying around 60 salient 
relations that are clustered into five semantic 
groups. In contrast, while JWAD-V1 is quite 
large-scale for a word association databases, it is 
naturally far smaller than the Japanese SkE cor-
pus. As already noted, it consists of word associ-
ation collected from about 50 respondents (al-
though there are 100 respondents in the case of 
kizuku), and where some responses would ob-
viously be provided by multiple respondents. 
Comparisons of the SkE results with the sets 
of word association responses revealed that there 
is considerable overlap in the range of lexical 
relationships observed in the two linguistics re-
sources. However, the comparisons also identi-
fied many lexical relationships that are only 
present in one of the language resources. 
3
Because of the large differences in the overall 
sizes of the association responses in JWAD-V1 
and the collocations in SkE, it is not surprising 
that the word association data does not cover the 
numerous collocation words present in the SkE 
results. (In future studies, we plan to examine the 
kinds of relationships that are extracted from the 
corpora but which are not observed in the word 
association database). However, it is very inter-
esting to note that a considerable number of the 
JWAD word associations were not present in the 
SkE results, even though the tool is drawing on a 
much larger resource. In this study, we concen-
trate on describing these lexical relationships.

present (+) and absent (-) in the Word Sketches 
(WS) and the Thesaurus (T) results 
Norms Ass. Freq ? 2 
Ass. Freq = 1 
WS+ WS- T+ WS+ WS- T+

sagasu 4 8 1 2 13 1 
jitensha 7 13 0 2 10 0 
natsu 3 4 1 5 13 1 
yama 6 3 2 8 7 2 
 
Table 1 shows that considerable numbers of 
word association responses with frequencies of 
two or more, as well as many with frequencies of 
one, are not observed in the word sketches and 
thesaurus results. While these results could be 
indicating a need to consider new methods or 
approaches to corpus-extraction in addition to 
those currently employed, these findings also 
strongly suggest that some of the lexical relation-
ships might be unique to the normative word as-
sociation data. Both resources unquestionably tap 
into fundamental aspects of lexical relationships, 
but the resources would seem to be quite differ-
ent in nature. Accordingly, the present results 
suggest that investigations into lexical relation-
ships would do well to employ both corpus-based 
results and databases of word association norms 
in complementary ways, in order to provide more 
comprehensive coverage of the diverse range of 
lexical relationships. 
The thesaurus function only outputs lexical re-
lationships between words of the same word 
class. This function also yields synonym rela-
tionships that are also found in the word associa-
tion norms, and are rated as being highly salient 
for the thesaurus results. For example, tanoshii 
and kyomibukai (???? interesting) are word 
association responses for omoshiroi. 
4.2 Lexical Relationships that are Common 
to Both the Corpus-Based Results and 
the Word Association Norms 
This section discusses some of the lexical rela-
tionships common to the two resources. The 
most frequent of these are presented in Table 2. 
The first ?coord? group includes kawa (? riv-
er) with the noun of yama, tanoshii (??? 
pleasant) with the adjective of omoshiroi, and 
odoroku (?? to be surprised) with the verb of 
kizuku. Other frequent relationships are verbal 
phrases involving appropriate particles (such as 
nounNI (e.g., jitensha ni noru (?????? to 
ride a bicycle), noPronom, nounWO (e.g., michi 
wo sagasu (???? to look for a road), deVerb, 
niVerb). Table 2 also includes a number of mod-
ification relationships (modifier_Adv, modifi-
er_Ai (e.g., atsui natsu (??? hot summer)). 
Note that these terms are those employed in the 
Word Sketch results.

4.3 Relations Specific to Association Norms 
While acknowledging that it could be beneficial 
to examine the types of lexical relationships ob-
served in the corpus-based results but not in the 
word association data, given the relative differ-
ences in the sizes of the two resources, the 
present study focuses on the relationships that 
were only present in the database of word associ-
ation norms. Briefly, these relationships can be 
classified under six categories. 
(1) Relationships involving a specific concept 
related to the stimulus word and its contextual 
meaning. In Table 3 below, many of these are 
classified as ?typically associated? words. Exam-
ples include omoshiroi and warai (????
?????  laughter), kizuku and ch?i (?? 
attention), and natsu and taiy? (?? sun). These 
relationships are neither collocational nor gram-
matical in nature, and so the grammatical analy-
sis currently employed in the word sketches can-
not identify them. On the other hand, while they 
are semantically related, because they often be-
long to different word classes, the thesaurus 
function also fails to identify them. 
(2) Relationships that are semantically similar 
(could be regarded as close synonyms) but do not 
belong to the same word class. Examples include 
sagasu and tanky? (?? search) and kizuku and-
kikubari (???  care, attention). While these 
are not grammatical or collocational relations, 
again, the thesaurus function is also unable to 
find them because they belong to different word 
classes. 
(3) Association responses consisting of more 
than one word. Examples include explanatory 
phrases such as kibun ga ii (?????  lit. 
?feeling is good?, comfortable) as response to 
omoshiroi, as well as concepts denoted by phras-
es, such as hito no kao (??? human faces), 
also a response to omoshiroi. 
(4) Relationships that could be recognized by the 
SkE, but which the present version fails to detect. 
These would seem to reflect limitations with the 
present ChaSen dictionary (e.g., it does not list 
chari / charinko (????????? casual 
words for bicycle) or morphological/POS-
tagging errors with ChaSen, or relationships that 
are not regarded as being sufficiently salient 
within the complete corpus, because they may 
appear frequently as both independent words and 
as constituents of many poly-morpheme words 
(e.g., omoshiroi hito (???? interesting per-
son)). 
(5) Relationships that can be identified when 
search is executed for orthographic variants of 
the word, such as tsumaranai (????? bor-
ing) being found when omoshiori is written in 
hiragana (as ?????). 
(6) Word association responses that are rather 
idiosyncratic in nature, often reflecting private 
experiences of a single respondent. The impor-
tance of such responses in word association data-
bases should be judged on the size of the data-
base, although one also should be cautious about 
sampling issues with lower respondent numbers. 
While it would certainly be interesting to con-
duct further comparisons between the association 
norms and other kinds of corpora, such as literary 
works, newspapers, or more balanced corpora, 
processed by the SkE, the main purpose of the 
present paper is to draw attention to the value of 
word association databases as linguistic re-
sources. Although the lexical relationships in 
categories 1 and 2 were not observed in the 
present corpus-based results, they are unques-
tionably of great relevance to efforts to develop 
more principled organizations of the lexicon for 
navigational purposes, and would enhance exist-
ing lexical resources, such as WordNet. With 
trends to increasingly include multiple word 
idioms and phrases within various dictionaries 
and linguistic resources, the multiple-word asso-
ciation responses of category 3 may provide fur-
ther insights into how such items are stored and 
processed. Moreover, categories 4 and 5 clearly 
suggest that free word association norms can be a 
very useful resource for evaluating and further 
improving morphological analyzers, as well as 
corpus query tools. 
5 Lexicographical Implications:  
Organizing Lexicons According to 
Association Relationships 
As the merits of SkE and its significant contribu-
tions to the compilation of a number of major 
dictionaries are discussed in detail elsewhere 
(e.g., Kilgarriff and Rundell, 2002), and because 
Srdanovi? and Nishina (2008) outline some poss-
ible lexicographical applications of the Japanese 
language version of the SkE, in this section, we 
focus on the lexical relationships observed within 
the JWAD and their lexicographical implications 
for realizing a principled association-based or-
ganization of the lexicon.

5.1 Linguistic Approaches to Association 
Data and Its Potential 
As previously commented, Deese (1965) and 
Cramer (1968) have both argued that word asso-
ciations closely mirror the structured patterns of 
relations that exist among concepts. Indeed, as 
Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) note, Deese 
(1965) was the first to conduct linguistic analyses 
of word association norms, such as measure-
ments of semantic similarity based on his convic-
tions that similar words evoke similar word asso-
ciation responses?an approach that is somewhat 
reminiscent of Church and Hanks? (1990) notion 
of mutual information. 
However, as we have also remarked already, 
the linguistic value of word association data has, 
regrettably, been largely overlooked. In a similar 
spirit to Hirst?s (2004) claim that, notwithstand-
ing certain caveats on the complex relationships 
between them, a lexicon can often serve as a use-
ful basis for developing a practical ontology, we 
believe that a very promising approach to orga-
nizing the lexicon would be to more fully appre-
ciate and utilize the rich variety of associative 
relationships that exist within word association 
norms. While the required, more thoroughgoing 
investigation into how to appropriately classify 
the complex nature of associative relationships is 
beyond the scope of this present study, in the 
next sub-section, we attempt to highlight the po-
tential contributions that word association norms 
could provide to efforts seeking to explore lexi-
cal knowledge. 
5.2 Tentative Classification of Association 
Relationships 
To illustrate some of the issues for developing 
a comprehensive, yet a parsimonious, classifica-
tion of associative relationships, it is useful to 
briefly consider the notion proposed by Zock and 
Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006) of word search 
strategies in electronic dictionaries based on as-
sociations. Their outline of how such a look-up 
system might function employs three kinds of 
basic association relationships; namely, ?a kind 
of? (AKO), ?subtype? (ISA), and ?typically in-
volved object, relation or actor? (TIORA). While 
we accept that the limited set of just three types 
was probably motivated primarily in the interests 
of simplicity, given Zock?s (2006) suggestion to 
enhance the navigability of the system by catego-
rizing relationships, clearly the classification of 
association relationships is a fundamental issue. 
Table 3 presents a tentative classification of 
the word association responses for the noun win-
ter. As the comparisons introduced in Section 4 
clearly demonstrate, it is usually possible to ex-
tract the modification and lexical sibling rela-
tionships included in Table 3 from corpora with 
corpus query tools such as SkE. However, the 
comparisons also highlighted the fact that it is far 
more difficult to identify the kinds of relation-
ships classified in Table 3 as typically associated 
with such linguistic resources alone. While high-
ly provisional in nature, we believe that the at-
tempt to classify the association relationships 
within the association responses for fuyu can 
6
serve to highlight some important issues for Zock 
and Bilac?s (2004) approach. 
While the lexical siblings relationships be-
tween fuyu and the two response words of natsu 
(? summer) and haru (? spring) could feasibly 
be represented by AKO or ISA relationship links 
to shiki (?? the four seasons) outside of the 
association set itself, having to rely on external 
references would not be a very satisfactory ap-
proach to classifying the direct association rela-
tionships. Incidentally, although the ?hyponyms 
of ?seasons?? description would seem fairly natu-
ral from the perspective of a thesaurus, the ab-
sence of aki (? autumn) from the set would in-
dicate that the strengths of associations can vary 
even among lexical siblings (although the ab-
sence of aki from the present data could simply 
be due to sampling issues). 
Given that fuyu is a noun, the presence of sev-
eral modification relationships is not very sur-
prising, at least not for the prime associate of 
samui (?? cold), but the idea of fuyu having a 
color attribute is perhaps initially more startling 
(while one many not expect ?winter? to have a 
default color slot within its range of attributes, 
the association of shiroi (?? white) with fuyu 
is initiatively appealing). 
For the fuyu association set, the most relevant 
of the association relationships specified by Zock 
and Bilac (2004) is the TIORA relationship. 
However, even for this relatively small associa-
tion set containing just 11 main relationship 
types, because seven of them can be initially 
classified as ?typically associated?, clearly this 
designation alone is too encompassing to be a 
useful classification category. The inclusion of 
the description field in Table 3 is an attempt to 
further define meaningful sub-categories. In the 
case of the sub-category ?meteorological pheno-
mena?, it would seem to be well motivated to 
explain the associations between fuyu as the sti-
mulus word and yuki (? snow) and k?ri (? ice) 
as two response words. However, while the sub-
category of ?cultural artifacts? clearly goes some 
way to pinpointing the underlying association 
between fuyu and kotatsu (???), it does rely 
on a certain cultural familiarity with the kind of 
quilted kind of blanket that are used for keeping 
one?s legs warm when sitting around a low fami-
ly table during winter. A natural association for 
anyone who has ever lived in Japan during the 
winter months, but ?typically associated? + ?cul-
tural artifact? seems to miss something of the 
naturalness. 
6 Conclusions 
This paper has compared the lexical relationships 
observed within Japanese collocation data ex-
tracted from a large corpus using the Japanese 
language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool 
and the relationships found within Japanese word 
association sets taken from the large-scale Japa-
nese Word Association Database (JWAD). 
The comparison results indicate that while 
many lexical relationships are common to both 
linguistic resources, a number of lexical relation-
ships were only observed in one of the resources. 
The fact that some lexical relationships might be 
unique to word association norms demonstrates 
the value of word association databases as lin-
guistic resources. The present findings suggest 
that both resources can be effectively used in 
combination in order to provide more compre-
hensive coverage of the wide range of lexical 
relationships. 
Finally, we presented a tentative classification 
of the association relationships in the association

 Abstract 
Word association data in dictionary form can be simulated through the combina-tion of three components: a bipartite graph with an imbalance in set sizes; a scale-free graph of the Barab?si-Albert model; and a normal distribution con-necting the two graphs.  Such a model makes it possible to simulate the complex features in degree distributions and the interesting graph clustering results that are typically observed for real data. 1 Modeling background Associative Concept Dictionaries (ACDs) consist of word pair data based on psychological ex-periments where the participants are typically asked to provide the semantically-related re-sponse word that comes to mind on presentation of a stimulus word. Two well-known ACDs for English are the University of South Florida word association, rhyme and word fragment norms (Nelson et al, 1998) and the Edinburgh Word Association Thesaurus of English (EAT; Kiss et al, 1973). Two ACDs for Japanese are Ishizaki?s Associative Concept Dictionary (IACD) (Oka-moto and Ishizaki, 2001) and the Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2006, 2007). While there are a number of practical applica-tions for ACDs, three are singled out for mention                                                 ? 2008.

here. The first is in the area of artificial intelli-gence, where ACDs can contribute to the devel-opment of intelligent information retrieval sys-tems for societies requiring increasingly sophisti-cated navigation methods. A second application is in the field of medicine, where ACDs could be used in developing systems that seek to prevent dementia by checking higher brain functions with a brain dock. Finally, within educational settings, ACDs can greatly facilitate language learning through the manifestation of inherent cultural modes of thinking. The typical format of an ACD is to list the stimulus words (cue words) and their response words together with some statistics relating to the word pairing. The stimulus words are generally basic words determined in advance by the ex-perimenter, while the response words are seman-tically associated words provided by respondents on presentation of the stimulus word. The statis-tics for the word pairing include, for example, measured or calculated indices of distance or perhaps some classification of the semantic rela-tionship between the pair of words. In order to mathematically analyze the struc-ture of ACDs, the raw association data is often transformed into some form of graph or complex network representation, where the vertices stand for words and the edges indicate an associative relationship (Joyce and Miyake, 2007). However, to our knowledge, there have been no attempts at mathematically simulating an ACD as a way of determining in advance the architectural design of a dictionary. One reason is that it is a major challenge to compute maximum likelihood esti-mations (MLEs) or Monte-Carlo simulations for graph data (Snijder, 2005). Thus, it is extremely difficult to predict dependences for unknown 
57
factors such as the lexical distribution across a predetermined and controllable dictionary framework starting simply from a list of basic words. Accordingly, we propose an easier and more basic approach to constructing an ACD model by combining random graph models to simulate graph features in terms of degree distri-butions and clustering results.  2 Degree distributions for ACDs 2.1 Typical local skew It is widely known that Barab?si and Albert (1999) have suggested that the degree distributions of scale-free network structures correspond to a power law, expressed as 
r
ddxP
?
== )(  (where d stands for degree and 
r  is a small number, such as 2 or 3). This type of distribution is also known as Zipf's law describing the typical frequency distribution of words in a document and plots on a log scale as a falling diagonal stroke. However, in the degree distribution of ACDs, there is always a local skew, as a local peak or bump with a low hemline. Figure 1 presents two degree distributions; for the IACD (upper) ( r  = 1.8) and the JWAD (lower) ( r  = 2.3).                        Figure 1. Degree distributions for actual data  The plots indicate a combination of heteroge-neous distributions, consisting of a single degree 
distribution represented as a bell form with a steep slope on the right side. However, what is most interesting here is that throughout the dis-tribution range the curves remain regular and continuous, with an absence of any ruptures or fractures both before and after the local peaks. When actual ACD data is examined, one finds that as response words are not linked together, almost all the words located in the skewed part are stimulus words (which we refer to as peak words in this study), while the items before the local peak are less frequent response words that have a strong tendency to conform to a decaying distribution. It is therefore relatively natural to divide all word pairs into two types of graph: either a bipartite graph for new response words that are not already part of the stimulus list and a graph that conforms to Zipf's law for the fre-quencies of response words that are already pre-sent in the stimulus list. For the first type, new response words are represented as nodes only with incoming links, generating a bipartite graph with two sets of different sizes. This bipartite graph would exhibit the decaying distribution due to low-frequency response words prior to the local peak. In the second type of graph, response words are represented as nodes with both incom-ing and outgoing links. This second type is simi-lar to a scale-free graph, such as that incorpo-rated within the Barab?si-Albert (BA) model. 2.2 Bipartite Graph and BA Model A bipartite graph is a graph consisting of vertices that are divided into two independent sets, S and R, such that every edge connects to one S vertex and one R vertex. The graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix with diagonal zero sub-matrices, where the values of the lower right sub-matrices would all be zero were it not for the appearances of some stimulus words as response words. The lower right section is exactly where the extremely high degrees of hubs are produced, which far exceed the average numbers of response words. Thus, we adopt an approach to generating a scale-free graph that reflects Zipf's law for fre-quency distributions. According to the BA model, the probability that a node receives an additional link is proportional to its degree. Here, we im-plement the principle of preferential attachment formulated by Bollob?s (2003):

with the addition of one condition that is specific to ACDs, which we explain below. The BA model starts with a small number, 
0
m  of vertices, and at each time step, T , a new vertex with m  edges is added and linked to m  different vertices that already exist in the graph. 
1+t
N  represents a random set of m  early vertices, )(id
t
 the degree of vertex 
i
 in the process at time t . The probability that a new vertex will be connected to a vertex 
i
 depends on the connectivity of that vertex, as expressed by Equation (1). However, we specifically assume that m  is a random natural number that is smaller than 
0
m , because in actual data the ratio of stimulus words among all responses words for each stimulus word is obviously far from constant. Moreover, the graph for the BA model here should be regarded as being a directed graph, because the very reason that hubs emerge within semantic network representations of ACDs is that the number of incoming edges is much larger than the expected number of nodes for each possible in-degree. In contrast, out-degree is limited by the number of responses for each stimulus word 
i
, which is represented as )(ic . Let )(ic  follow a normal distribution with a mean cm and a small variance value 2?  (which is not constant but nearly so) to smoothly combine the distribution of the bipartite graph and the power distribution. If a directed adjacency matrix for the network exclusively between stimulus words is expressed as

The subse-quent sub-matrix tP  refers to the transposition of the prior sub-matrix P . The adjacency matrix in Equation (3) represents a pseudo bipartite graph structure where the upper left section is a zero sub-matrix (because there are no intercon-
nections among new response words), but the lower right section is not. Here,

Degree distribution of an ACD model  The degree distribution for the artificial net-work is consistent with the features observed for actual ACD data, where more than 96% of the stimulus words in each data set are distributed across the peak section of the degree distribution, which is why we have referred to them as peak words. Moreover, it is easy to verify that without the assumption of a normal distribution for )(ic , distinct fractures emerge in the artificial curve where new response words in the bipartite struc-

ture would be distinguished from stimulus words located at initial points of the local peak. 3 Markov Clustering of ACDs 3.1 MCL This section introduces the graph clustering method that is applied to both the real and artifi-cial ACD data in order to compare them. Markov Clustering (MCL) proposed by Van Dongen (2001) is well known as a scalable unsupervised cluster algorithm for graphs that decomposes a whole graph into small coherent groups by simu-lating the probability movements of a random walker across the graph. It is believed that when MCL is applied to semantic networks, it yields clusters of words that share certain similarities in meaning or appear to be related to common con-cepts. 3.2 MCL Results The clustering results for the ACD model created by combining random graphs reveal that each of the resultant clusters contains only one stimulus word surrounded by several response words. This result is somewhat strange because there are dense connections between stimulus words, which would lead us to assume that clusters would have multiple stimulus word. However, the results of applying MCL clustering to the graph for the ACD model are in reality highly influenced by the sub-structure of the bipartite graph and less dependent on the scale-free structure. Nevertheless, the result is quite similar to results observed with real data. On examining MCL clustering results for different ACD semantic networks, we have observed that MCL clusters tend to consist of one word node with a relatively high degree and some other words with relatively low degrees. On closer inspection of the graph, it is possible to see several supporter nodes that gather around one leader node, forming a kind of small conceptual community. This suggests that the highest degree word for each cluster becomes a representative for that particular cluster consisting of some other low degree words. In short, MCL clustering is executed based on such high degree words that tend to have relatively low curvature values (Dorow, 2005) compared to their high average degree values. 
4 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed a basic approach to simulating word association dictionary data through the application of graph methodologies. This modeling is expected not only to provide insights into the structures of real ACD data, but also to predict, by manipulating the model pa-rameters, possible forms for future ACDs. Future research will focus on constructing an exponen-tial random graph model for ACDs based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. References Barab?si, Albert-L?szl? and R?ka Albert. 1999.

Abstract
Regarding the construction of an ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as fundamental in
terms of establishing a conceptual framework to guide and facilitate the construction of a large-scale
lexical resource (LR) database of the Japanese lexicon, this paper primarily focuses on two major
concerns for the construction of the JLP-O. The first is to map out and appropriately structure the
numerous lexical and psycholinguistic properties, or variables, associated with the Japanese lexicon.
The second concern is to specify an appropriate range of lexical entries classes within the JLP-O.
Both concerns have far-reaching implications for effectively capturing the rich patterns of intercon-
nections among lexical entries and lexical properties and thus for realizing a multifunctional LR.
After discussing the solutions integrated into the current Resource Description Framework (RDF)
representation of the JLP-O, the paper also briefly describes the extraction of a corpus-based lexicon
from the recently released Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ; Maekawa
et al., 2013), an authoritative sampling of the contemporary Japanese lexicon. Categorized according
to the JLP-O?s range of lexical entry classes, and supplemented with orthographic variant and decom-
position information, the BCCWJ-based lexicon represents a key reference LR for constructing the
large-scale LR.
1 Introduction
The overarching objective of our research project is to construct a large-scale lexical resource (LR) of
Japanese lexical properties?interpreted inclusively as any characteristic or variable associated with words?
which, as a comprehensivemodel of the Japanese lexicon, can potentially be beneficial for various researchers
within the linguistic and cognitive sciences. Within that larger endeavor, we regard the task of constructing
an ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as being absolutely foundational for two important rea-
sons. The first is primarily pragmatic in nature. As reflected in the relatively recent trend towards merging
LRs and ontologies (Huang et al., 2010; Oltramari et al., 2013), the formal specification of the ontology can
unquestionably provide considerable advantages in terms of enhanced compatibility with natural language
processing (NLP) and knowledge system tools for efficiently integrating data, checking for consistency, and
realizing powerful query functionality. In contrast, however, the second reason is both more conceptual and
more skeptical in nature. In many ways, ontology construction can be thought of as the very epitome of aca-
demic endeavor in seeking to clearly elucidate the phenomenon of interest, but it is also crucial to understand
that natural systems, such as language, do not necessarily conform to the standards of ontological complete-
ness. As outlined further in section 2, our approach to ontology construction particularly values the utility of
the ontology as working conceptual framework. Reflecting this, our approach attempts to strike a reasonable
balance between ontological rigor, on the one hand, and recognizing a number of other important cognitive
criteria, on the other hand, such as theoretical description, consistencies, psychological reality, and prefer-
ences, in order to realize a core framework that can both guide the construction of the LR and, ultimately,
facilitate multifunctional querying.
Against that larger background, this paper specifically focuses on two major concerns addressed in con-
structing the JLP-O. Given the extensive range of Japanese lexical properties that must be represented in a

satisfactory manner within a large-scale LR for the Japanese lexicon, the first concern has been to map out
and appropriately structure the many and varied lexical and psycholinguistic properties, or variables, asso-
ciated with the Japanese lexicon into domains, or modules. The second major concern has been to specify
an appropriate range of lexical entries as core entities of the JLP-O for a highly agglutinative language like
Japanese. As outlined in more detail in section 3, these concerns have direct implications for implementing
effective links among lexical entries and lexical properties. In section 4, we explain how both concerns have
been resolved within the JLP-O in ways that simultaneously help to represent the rich patterns of intercon-
nectivity between various lexical properties and facilitate the realization of a multifunctional LR that both
possesses powerful search capabilities and can be utilized by a wide range of users. Section 4 also outlines
the extraction and formal encoding of a major corpus-based lexicon essential for constructing the LR. Section
5 recaps the main points and briefly discusses future work for the larger LR project.
2 Ontology as conceptual framework
After some general comments about defining ontologies, this section also briefly introduces the two models
for LRs that we specifically draw inspiration from in constructing the JLP-O; namely, the lemon model
(lexical model for ontologies; http://lemon-model.net/) and Spohr?s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs.
2.1 General comments
Although Gruber?s (1993; 199) immensely influential pronouncement that an ?ontology is an explicit specifi-
cation of a conceptualization? continues to provide the basic template, following Guarino (1998) and Guarino
et al. (2009), many subsequent definitions of ontologies tend to also emphasize the shared nature of the con-
ceptualization (Guarino et al., 2009; Pr?vot et al., 2010). The elements of this ontology definition require a
little unpacking. First, conceptualization refers to both the explicit and implicit knowledge about a system
or entity, such as its component entities and their relations. Next, explicit, or formal, specification refers to
a commitment to encode the body of knowledge in the form of some representation language, usually in a
machine-readable format. And, finally, shared conceptualization refers to the criterion that, to have value,
there should be a general consensus among interested parties about the target conceptualization (Guarino et
al., 2009; Pr?vot et al., 2010).
As already suggested, our approach towards ontology construction is admittedly somewhat nuanced in
nature, reflecting a basic tension at the conceptual level. While we fully concur with the laudable drive to-
wards clearer descriptions of phenomena that ontology construction entails, we are equally cautious of seeing
ontologies alone as some magical panacea for all knowledge representation problems. The sentiment is par-
ticularly visceral in the case of natural systems like language which abounds in various forms of redundancy
and biases that are not readily represented by ontologies. Thus, in our efforts to construct a comprehensive
model of the Japanese lexicon, we are endeavoring to incorporate vital aspects of linguistic and cognitive
knowledge that are embedded within its diverse lexical properties. However, at the pragmatic level, we
acutely recognize the numerous benefits of adopting the ontology as a conceptual framework for effectively
realizing the overall research objective of constructing a large-scale LR database of Japanese lexical proper-
ties. In some ways, our qualified position on ontology construction is rather aptly captured in the following
comments from Franconi, Kerhet, and Ngo (2013):
An ontology provides a conceptual view of the database and it is composed by constraints on a
vocabulary extending the basic vocabulary of the data. Querying a database using the terms in such
a richer ontology allows for more flexibility than using only the basic vocabulary of the relational
database directly.
2.2 Models for linguistic resources
For the sake of clarity (albeit at some risk of possibly overstating what may already be sufficiently obvi-
ous), our primary objective in constructing the JLP-O is to have a conceptual view, or framework, to aid the
development of a large-scale LR database with multifunctional querying capabilities, which we hope will
come to serve as a comprehensive model of the Japanese lexicon. That is to say, we are seeking to apply
175
linguistic, psycholinguistic and cognitive conceptualizations about Japanese words in order to realize a for-
mal specification of the Japanese lexicon. This naturally brings into focus the next vital piece in the puzzle;
namely, the need for an ontology model that is particularly suitable for linguistic resources, where linguistic
and psycholinguistic conceptualizations (lexical properties) are linked to the lexical entries (words) of the
database. Although a number of candidate models exist, such as LexInfo (Cimiano, Buitelaar, McCrae, &
Sintek, 2011), LIR (Linguistic Information Repository; Peters, Montiel-Ponsoda, & Cea, 2007) and LMF
(Lexical Markup Framework; Francopoulo, 2013), the present work draws inspiration most directly from the
lemon model and Spohr?s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs.
Building directly on the LexInfo, LIR and LMF models, lemon has been specifically developed to be a
standard for the exchange of lexical information on the semantic web, and so it has a number of advantages
that are particularly appealing for JLP-O. These include the facts that lemon is based on RDF, a semantic web
standard that can greatly facilitate the representation of links between parts of the LR, and that, reflecting its
policy not to prescribe over linguistics definitions, lemon effectively delegates the burdens of constraining
domain-specific information to external sources, such as WordNet and ontologies of linguistic descriptions
such as GOLD (General Ontology for Linguistic Description; http://linguistics-ontology.org/). Other advan-
tages are that lemon is relatively concise, because it requires few classes and relies on external definitions,
and that it is organized in terms of a number of separate modules, which can be constructed independently
for greater flexibility. In contrast, reflecting its emergence from the intersection between semantic web tech-
nology and lexicography, Spohr?s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs is particularly concerned with the
informational needs of diverse users, encompassing both humans (from monolinguals, bilinguals, novices,
to linguistic experts) and NLP applications, and with realizing suitable query and display interfaces. As the
goal of achieving a high degree of multifunctionality, in Spohr?s sense of the notion, is also central to our LR
project, we particularly take to heart Spohr?s suggestion that one vital key for realizing multifunctionality is
the incorporation of an appropriate typology, or range, of lexical entries.
3 Construction concerns
This section briefly sketches out the twomajor issues for constructing the JLP-O; namely, appropriately struc-
turing the wide range of lexical properties associated with the Japanese lexicon and determining a suitable
range of lexical entries. The solutions incorporated into JLP-O?s RDF representation are discussed further in
section 4.
3.1 Range of Japanese lexical properties
For researchers within the language and cognitive sciences to be able conduct significant research on various
aspects of the Japanese language, such as developing more robust models and simulations of linguistic and
cognitive abilities, obviously, access to a wide range of information about the contemporary Japanese lexicon
is absolutely essential. Traditionally, available LRs have been limited to various kinds of dictionaries, such as
language dictionaries like Shinmura?s (2008) K?jien and Kindaiichi et al.?s (2011) Shinmeikai Kokugojiten
and character dictionaries like Morohashi?s (2000) Daikanwajiten. However, as dictionaries rarely provide
much summary information beyond headword counts, researchers have also had to rely on scarce sources of
data summaries. Hayashi?s (1982) Z?setsu Nihongo is a classic example that included a lexical section, with
some frequency, word class and formation information, an orthographic section, with some counts, usage and
readings information for kanji in particular, as well as sections on phonology and accent, grammar, and style.
Setting aside genuine issues for keeping such data up-to-date, however, a particularly serious problem is the
tremendous expansion in the range of lexical properties that researchers require data about today. One helpful
way to understand the variety of lexical properties is in terms of Nation?s (2001/2013) aspects of knowing a
word. Highly influential in the areas of vocabulary research and second language acquisition, his framework
consists of nine broad types of word knowledge grouped under threemain categories of form (spoken, written,
and word parts), meaning (form and meaning, concept and referent, and associations) and use (grammatical
functions, collocations, and constraints on use (such as register and frequency)). In addition to the breadth
dimension, it is also useful to think about the considerable range of lexical properties in terms of the depths of
analyses conducted within these various domains. For instance, taking just the domain of visual word recog-
176
nition experiments to illustrate, Adelman (2012) recently notes 14 kinds of potentially confounding lexical
variables that should be controlled for, including frequency and contextual diversity data, various forms of
neighborhoods (orthographic, phonological, phonographic, and Levenshtein-distance), spelling-sound regu-
larities and consistencies, length, morphological properties as well as rating-based measures. While granting
that some of these form-related lexical properties will undoubtedly also be of interest to researchers in other
areas, still, equally undeniably, they will also require information about many other lexical properties, such
as semantic properties of denotation and semantic groups of thesauri, or usage information, such as valencies,
collocations and associations, and educational levels.
In addition to facilitating the integration and ongoing maintenance of the large-scale LR, we see the con-
struction of the JLP-O as being especially valuable for helping to elucidate divergent interpretations about
lexical properties. For instance, regardless of the markedly different theoretical motivations underlying or-
thographic neighborhoods and morphological families, LRs of kanji compound neighborhoods and LRs of
morphological families yield identical data, at least, with respect to the possible two-compound word combi-
nations for a given set of kanji. Awareness of such data equivalencies despite contrasting ontological perspec-
tives is vital both for realizing robust queries of the LR and, in turn, for developing more robust simulations
and models.
3.2 UniDic?s short-unit words
For a research project aiming to construct a large-scale LR that can serve as a comprehensive model of the
Japanese lexicon, one of the thorniest issues that must be addressed is surely just what to treat as the core
entities within the LR database in the case of a highly agglutinative language like Japanese where word
boundaries are often ambiguous. While doubting that an ideal solution exists, given that any decision is
certain to have broad implications for implementing a LR, the issue must be taken seriously.
In this context, it is illustrative to look at UniDic; the electronic morphological dictionary for the Japanese
language that was developed as part of the BCCWJ project. Reflecting its objectives to be a high-performance
dictionary for wide coverage of contemporary written Japanese, UniDic adopted as its prime entity the so-
called short-unit word (SUW), which roughly corresponds to the shortest meaningful unit, the morpheme.
However, although that decision is certainly not without some justification, as Joyce, Hodo??ek and Nishina
(2012) discuss, it is also fair to say that the SUW is far from convenient for human users, unless additional in-
formation about higher-order groupings is also readily available. Although the BCCWJ project?s provision of
supplementary information in the form of annotations about so-called long-unit words (LUWs)?groupings
of verb and adjective agglutinations and compound nouns as single units?probably originates from this is-
sue, still, the distinction is somewhat artificial and requires a certain degree of familiarity. Figure 1 highlights
the basic relationships between UniDic?s SUWs and LUWs, with an example sentence of???????
?? /h?kokusho o yomihajimeru/ ?to begin reading a report (document)? consisting of three LUWs. The
two content LUWs of ???/h?kokusho/ ?report (document)? and ????? /yomihajimeru/ ?to begin
reading? are both combinations of two SUWs, while case-marking particles, like the object marker?/o/, are
simultaneously both SUWs and LUWs.

177
While again acknowledging that any proposals about what to treat as core lexical entries within a LR of
the Japanese lexicon are likely to involve some degree of compromise, still one obvious lesson to emerge
from referring to the UniDic case is that a single lexical unit alone is insufficient in order to handle all items
of the Japanese lexicon adequately for all kinds of users. As outlined further in section 4.2, our solution for
JLP-O is to specify a wider range of lexical entries. However, despite the problems of SUWs and LUWs
associated with the BCCWJ, it is an authoritative sampling of the contemporary Japanese lexicon, consisting
of approximately 100 million words. Accordingly, it unquestionably remains the most valuable source from
which to extract a corpus-based lexicon, with information about numerous core lexical properties, including
lemma and orthographic specification, their respective frequencies, their phonological information and word
classes, to establish a solid foundation to the construction of the large-scale LR project.
4 JLP-O construction
Having touched on the extensive range of Japanese lexical properties and the inherent tensions involved in
selecting a range of lexical entry classes, this section turns to explain how these concerns have been handled
in constructing the current version of the JLP-O. The section also outlines the extraction of the BCCWJ-based
lexicon and the assignment of JLP-O?s LexicalEntry subclasses as a foundation for the LR.
4.1 JLP-O modules
Although a number of separate Japanese LRs have already been created to address various lexical properties,
given that they have been developed with different objectives and with diverging interpretations about the
lexical properties themselves, their treatments of key properties, such as phonological, orthographic or se-
mantic information, are not always consistent across resources, which can also vary greatly in terms of their
levels of coverage. In order to help remedy this situation, the overall aim of our research project is to create
a single comprehensive LR by constructing the JLP-O as its core framework to facilitate the integration of
existing LRs.
Some of the initial groundwork for the LR project is outlined by Joyce, Masuda, and Ogawa (2014), within
the context of discussing the revised j?y? kanji list as the core building block of the Japanese writing system.
In addition to identifying and organizing a number of lexical properties at the j?y? kanji character level, they
also describe a new analysis of the components of j?y? and JIS1 kanji, and apply an initial orthographic coding
to the corpus word lists created in Joyce et al. (2012). Building directly from that, our continuing investiga-
tions of lexical properties have already identified 65 important properties; although, naturally, we fully expect
the number to expand still further as additional LRs are consulted and examined for their particular merits.
Reflecting both their natural mutual relationships and the need to structure their representations within the
LR, these properties have also been organized under six modules of character, orthographic, phonological,
morphological, semantic, and use. These are presented in Table 1 with a few examples of the relevant lexical
properties.
Modules Example properties
Character type, configuration, internal structure, stroke counts, status, references, ?
Orthographic representation, variations, length (in characters), neighborhood data, ?
Phonological stress, length (in mora), CV structures, homophones, neighborhoods, consistency, ?
Morphological word structure, family data (size/frequency), constituent analysis, transparency, ?
Semantic denotation, connotations, sense range, lexical stratum, groups, concreteness, relations,?
Use frequency/familiarity data, collocations, grammatical patterns, genre/register/style, ?
Table 1: The six modules of the JLP-O with examples of relevant lexical properties.
This structuring of the lexical properties is highly consistent with lemon?s modular design, which includes
five modules in its core: linguistic description, variation, phrase structure, syntax and mapping, and mor-
phology. We are, therefore, able to utilize a great deal of lemon?s basic descriptive infrastructure pretty much
intact, albeit with some relabeling of module names and some element reallocations to conform to JLP-O?s
178
modularization of lexical properties. For example, much of lemon?s syntax and mapping module could be
used with only minimal label changes in the integration of LRs such as Japanese versions ofWordNet (Isahara
et al., 2012) and FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2004) to JLP-O?s semantic and use modules, respectively. In con-
trast, however, some basic characteristics of the Japanese lexicon, such as unit size issues and more extensive
levels of orthographic variation, necessitate more expressive alternatives to both lemon?s variation module
and the decomposition property within the phrase structure module. Given these clear parallels, however, we
believe that lemon?s notion of modules is the most effective approach to structuring the lexical properties and
to realizing their complex mappings to the range of lexical entries within our LR.
4.2 JLP-O?s core range of lexical entries
As noted in subsection 3.2, one of the thorniest concerns to address in constructing a large-scale LR of the
Japanese lexicon is to determine a suitable range of lexical entries to use as the core entities of the database.
The issue is certainly far from straightforward, because it involves finding a workable compromise between
a set of conflicting constraints. Naturally, these include the highly agglutinative nature of the Japanese lan-
guage itself, which, understandably, encourages a focus towards the smallest components. However, these
constraints also include the needs of diverse users of the LR, where, in contrast, as Spohr (2012) convincingly
argues, a wider range is preferable for enhancing the search capabilities of an LR. At its heart, however, the
issue is primarily about representation, or formal specification, given that the complex relationships between
lexical entries themselves and between lexical entries and themodules of lexical properties must be efficiently
captured within the JLP-O.
However, on consulting with our two reference models for LRs for guidance, we discover that they
adopt radically different approaches to the specification of lexical entries. Consistent with its aspirations
to be concise, lemon specifies just three classes of lexical entries; namely, Part, Word and Phrase.
While this rather minimalist level of specification is, arguably, not so dissimilar to the de facto distinc-
tion that emerges with UniDic between SUWs and LUWs, comparisons quickly break down on closer in-
spection. For example, SUWs cover both bound morphemes (affixes and particles) and free morphemes
(simple words), but these would correspond to lemon?s part and word classes, respectively. The LUW con-
cept also fails to fit nicely with lemon?s tripartite division. Given that LUWs are either polymorphemic
words or compound words formed by combining SUWs, the unit does not extend to phrases which are
not marked by UniDic. In sharp contrast, but also consistent with his goal of multifunctionality, Spohr?s
MLR model incorporates a highly detailed typology of lexical entries (lexemes). Although the upper-
level division into BoundUnit, FreeUnit, and Clitic may not, at first glance, appear so different, the
subsequent divisions of BoundUnit into BoundStem and Affix (further divided into 9 kinds) and of
FreeUnit into Idiom, Syntactically-ComplexFreeUnit, and Syntactically-SimpleFreeUnit
(of which the final two are further divided eventually into 17 and 11 subclasses, respectively) clearly demon-
strate very different theoretical motivations and objectives. That noted, however, the distinction between
Syntactically-SimpleFreeUnit and Syntactically-ComplexFreeUnit parallels more closely to
the contrast between SUWs and LUWs.
Aiming for a realistic balance between the constraints afforded by the characteristics of the Japanese lex-
icon, the LR?s ambitions to realize a high degree of multifunctionality, and the need to achieve an accept-
able degree of formal specification concerning the relationships among lexical entries and the six modules
of lexical properties, the solution that we adopt for JLP-O is closer in spirit to the upper-levels of Spohr?s
(2012) typology of lexeme subclasses. More specifically, as illustrated in Table 2, we specify for JLP-O
five classes of LexicalEntry, which are Character, BoundUnit, SimpleWord, ComplexWord, and
MultiWordExpression. Thus, while the basic entities of the JLP-O draws inspiration more directly from
Spohr?s typology of lexeme classes, the range of JLP-O lexical entries has been increased in order to more
faithfully represent the nature of the Japanese lexicon.
4.3 Extraction and RDF encoding of corpus lexicon
Having identified our practical solutions, this section briefly outlines their implementation in the RDF encod-
ing. First, the current version of the JLP-O was specified by extending lemon?s OWL specification using the
Prot?g? ontology editor (http://protege.stanford.edu/). Second, a program was executed to simultaneously
179
Lexical entry type Examples of units included
Character kanji (?), hiragana (?), katakana (?), r?maji (KA), ?
BoundUnit prefixes (??), suffixes (??), auxiliary verbs (???), ?
SimpleWord nouns (??), verbs (??), particles (?), adjectives (???), ?
ComplexWord nouns (???), verbs (?????), adjectives (?????), ?
MultiWordExpression collocations, idioms
Table 2: Examples of lexical entries.
extract the corpus lexicon from the BCCWJ corpus and assign the appropriate LexicalEntry subclasses.
In addition to replacing lemon?s three classes of lexical entries with JLP-O?s five LexicalEntry sub-
classes, two further minor extensions to the structure and facilities provided by the lemon model have also
been necessary. The first minor extension relates to the high levels of orthographic variation that exists within
the Japanese lexicon, as evidenced in Joyce et al. (2012), which is far beyond that envisioned by either lemon
or Spohr?s models. In seeking to be more consistent with UniDic?s basic distinction between an abstract
lemma form and all orthographic variations of a Japanese word, we have somewhat expanded upon lemon?s
distinction between canonicalForm and otherForm, by retaining the first label for the lemma form and
changing the otherForm label to orthographicForm for each orthographic variant of a word. The second
minor expansion is to more extensively utilize lemon?s decomposition object property (which in lemon is
limited to specifying the decomposition of phrases into parts). Thus, apart from the Character subclass
within the current JLP-O (compositional analysis of radicals is not fully implemented at present), all lexical
entry classes have a decomposition object property; such that both BoundUnit and SimpleWord en-
tries are decomposed into one or more Characters, while the orthographicForms of ComplexWord and
MultiWordExpression entries are decomposed into the relevant orthographicForms of BoundUnits
and SimpleWords. By adopting this approach to linking structures, it is possible to search for complex lexi-
cal entries based on lower-level components, such as characters, by traversing the implemented hierarchical
structure. Figure 2 shows a part of the lexical model with a focus on the lexical entries.
In order to extract the corpus lexicon, a program was written to convert the SUW and LUW infor-
mation from the BCCWJ corpus into the JLP-O?s RDF format, including the appropriate assignment of
LexicalEntry subclasses. The M-XML format of the BCCWJ (version 1) includes basic structural en-
codings of LUWs in the form of lists of component SUWs. First, SUWs were assigned as either BoundUnit
or SimpleWord lexical entries based on their unique identifier, which consists of the unique combination
of the lemma and the POS category. Next, all orthographic variations of the lexical entry (based on their
shared identifier) were recorded within the single entry specification using the orthographicForm object
property, together with their decompositions into lists of characters. Finally, the frequency counts for or-
thographic variants were recorded using the use object property, allowing us to specify frequency counts
together with their sources, which in the present case is a corpus identifier but could also specify a particular
genre or style. The total frequency count, as sum of all orthographicForm variants, was also recorded
under the canonicalForm property.
Figure 3 shows part of the RDF encoding in Turtle format for the SimpleWord lexical entry for the verb
?? /yomu/ ?to read?. For the sake of brevity, it is not possible to display all 12 orthographic variants, but
the figure includes the three most frequent; the standard kanji-kana mixed orthography (of verbal stem and
inflectional ending), the hiragana-orthography representation of??, and a kanji variation of?? with the
nuances of ?to read or recite poetry; chant?.
Similarly, Figure 4 presents part of the RDF encoding in Turtle format for the SimpleWord lexical entry
of the verb ??? /hajimeru/ ?to begin?. Interestingly, ??? is the verb2 element of many verb1-verb2
compounds that express senses of ?to begin V1?.
Finally, the extraction program also assigned LUWs to the ComplexWord subclass. The process essentially
mirrored the extraction of BoundUnit or SimpleWord lexical entries, except that links under the decom-
position object property link back to its constituent BoundUnit or SimpleWord lexical entries. Figure 5
presents part of the ComplexWord lexical entry for????? /yomihajimeru/ ?to begin to read?, which is

We executed the extraction and RDF encoding program to enumerate the BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon
according to the JLP-O?s core LexicalEntry classes. As summarized in Table 3, approximately 2.7 million
lexical entries were assigned to the four core LexicalEntry classes.
Lexical entry Types Tokens
Characters 6,761 195,500,491
BoundUnit 433 11,327,729
SimpleWord 195,380 112,557,387
ComplexWord 2,438,506 101,684,786
Table 3: Type and token counts for the BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon.
The number of lexical entries assigned to the Character subclass is highly consistent with encoding spec-
ifications for Japanese characters. Similarly, the relatively smaller number of BoundUnit lexical entries is
also consistent with the fact that this class consists of a small number of closed word classes, such as parti-
cles and the relatively limited sets of affixes. In contrast, the much higher counts for the SimpleWord and
ComplexWord classes obviously reflect in largemeasure the fact that these cover themajor openword classes,
and, in particular, the noun class, which is extremely open. Another closely related factor is that these lexical
entries also include vast numbers of proper nouns, which is a particular feature of large corpus data. The sub-
stantial difference between the SimpleWord and ComplexWord classes clearly illustrates the agglutinative
nature of the Japanese language with rich verbal and adjectival conjugations and productive compounding.
However, also a characteristic of large corpus data, it should also be noted that approximately 66% of the
ComplexWord lexical entries occur only once within the BCCWJ corpus. And, a natural corollary is that
while the ComplexWord lexical entries are on average decomposed into 3.1 BoundUnit and SimpleWord
lexical entries, 94% of these have only one orthographic variant (because, for extremely low frequency words,
one obviously requires even larger corpora to capture all possible orthographic variations). A final observa-
tion to make is that the corpus lexicon does not yield any lexical entries under the MultiWordExpressions
subclass; although it would be feasible to extract collocational data from the BCCWJ, these will be identified
for the large-scale LR in the future in the course of integrating other LRs.
5 Conclusion
As a principal component of a larger research project to construct a large-scale LR database concerned with
the lexical and psycholinguistic properties associated with the Japanese lexicon, the paper has described the
construction of the ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as its working conceptual framework.
More specifically, the paper focused on two important issues. After outlining the first concern of mapping
out and organizing the wide range of lexical and psycholinguistic properties that linguistic and cognitive
science researchers require up-to-date information about in section 3.1, section 4.1 detailed how these are
being structured under six modules, which mirrors the flexible approach towards construction employed
by lemon. Similarly, after outlining the second difficult concern of what to treat as core entities of the LR
database in section 3.2, section 4.2 explained the reason behind our solution to recognize five LexicalEntry
classes, namely, that a wider range of classes is key to achieving the high degree of multifunctionality that
our LR project aspires to (Spohr, 2012). Section 4.3 also outlined the extraction and RDF encoding of the
BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon. Classified according to the JLP-O?s range of lexical entries, and supplemented
with information about orthographic variations, decompositions and frequencies, the corpus lexicon provides
solid foundations for the large-scale project to construct the comprehensive LR of Japanese lexical properties.
Although we are fully aware that it will be necessary to further develop and refine the JLP-O as the larger
LR project progresses, as the present working version has been constructed to specifically handle two fun-
damental aspects about the Japanese lexicon, we believe that it represents a sufficiently robust conceptual
framework that can guide future work of integrating existing LRs. Thus, we approach the integration task
not merely as a mechanical process of expanding the LR database by merging data, but as a dialectic one
183
that requires ongoing consideration and investigation of the theoretical adequacies and psychological reali-
ties of candidate lexical properties; a reflective process that is exemplified by ontology construction. And, as
a working conceptual framework for examining the LR database, the JLP-O represents the kind of architec-
tural blueprint of the structural relationships within the LR database that is essential for realizing high degrees
of multifunctionality in terms of developing various interfaces for search queries and data presentation. In
this way, we hope to realize a comprehensive LR of Japanese lexical properties that will be beneficial as a
systematic model of the Japanese lexicon that can be effectively mined in the pursuit of deeper insights into
lexical knowledge.
