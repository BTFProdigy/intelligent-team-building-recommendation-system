Abstract
It is practically impossible to build a
word-based lexicon for speech recogni-
tion in agglutinative languages that would
cover all the relevant words. The prob-
lem is that words are generally built by
concatenating several prefixes and suffixes
to the word roots. Together with com-
pounding and inflections this leads to mil-
lions of different, but still frequent word
forms. Due to inflections, ambiguity and
other phenomena, it is also not trivial to
automatically split the words into mean-
ingful parts. Rule-based morphological
analyzers can perform this splitting, but
due to the handcrafted rules, they also suf-
fer from an out-of-vocabulary problem. In
this paper we apply a recently proposed
fully automatic and rather language and
vocabulary independent way to build sub-
word lexica for three different agglutina-
tive languages. We demonstrate the lan-
guage portability as well by building a
successful large vocabulary speech recog-
nizer for each language and show superior
recognition performance compared to the
corresponding word-based reference sys-
tems.
1 Introduction
Speech recognition for dictation or prepared radio
and television broadcasts has had huge advances
during the last decades. For example, broadcast
news (BN) in English can now be recognized with
about ten percent word error rate (WER) (NIST,
2000) which results in mostly quite understandable
text. Some rare and new words may be missing but
the result has proven to be sufficient for many im-
portant applications, such as browsing and retrieval
of recorded speech and information retrieval from
the speech (Garofolo et al, 2000). However, besides
the development of powerful computers and new al-
gorithms, a crucial factor in this development is the
vast amount of transcribed speech and suitable text
data that has been collected for training the mod-
els. The problem faced in porting the BN recogni-
tion systems to conversational speech or to other lan-
guages is that almost as much new speech and text
data have to be collected again for the new task.
The reason for the need for a vast amount of train-
ing texts is that the state-of-the-art statistical lan-
guage models contain a huge amount of parameters
to be estimated in order to provide a proper probabil-
ity for any possible word sequence. The main reason
for the huge model size is that for an acceptable cov-
erage in an English BN task, the vocabulary must
be very large, at least 50,000 words, or more. For
languages with a higher degree of word inflections
than English, even larger vocabularies are required.
This paper focuses on the agglutinative languages in
which words are frequently formed by concatenat-
ing one or more stems, prefixes, and suffixes. For
these languages in which the words are often highly
inflected as well as formed from several morphemes,
even a vocabulary of 100,000 most common words
would not give sufficient coverage (Kneissler and
487
Klakow, 2001; Hirsim?ki et al, 2005). Thus, the
solution to the language modeling clearly has to in-
volve splitting of words into smaller modeling units
that could then be adequately modeled.
This paper focuses on solving the vocabulary
problem for several languages in which the speech
and text database resources are much smaller than
for the world?s main languages. A common fea-
ture for the agglutinative languages, such as Finnish,
Estonian, Hungarian and Turkish is that the large
vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR)
attempts so far have not resulted comparable perfor-
mance to the English systems. The reason for this
is not only the language modeling difficulties, but,
of course, the lack of suitable speech and text train-
ing data resources. In (Geutner et al, 1998; Sii-
vola et al, 2001) the systems aim at reducing the
active vocabulary and language models to a feasi-
ble size by clustering and focusing. In (Szarvas and
Furui, 2003; Alum?e, 2005; Hacioglu et al, 2003)
the words are split into morphemes by language-
dependent hand-crafted morphological rules. In
(Kneissler and Klakow, 2001; Arisoy and Arslan,
2005) different combinations of words, grammati-
cal morphemes and endings are utilized to decrease
the OOV rate and optimize the speech recognition
accuracy. However, constant large improvements
over the conventional word-based language models
in LVCSR have been rare.
The approach presented in this paper relies on a
data-driven algorithm called Morfessor (Creutz and
Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2005) which is a
language independent unsupervised machine learn-
ing method to find morpheme-like units (called sta-
tistical morphs) from a large text corpus. This
method has several advantages over the rule-based
grammatical morphemes, e.g. that no hand-crafted
rules are needed and all words can be processed,
even the foreign ones. Even if good grammatical
morphemes are available, the language modeling re-
sults by the statistical morphs seem to be at least as
good, if not better (Hirsim?ki et al, 2005). In this
paper we evaluate the statistical morphs for three
agglutinative languages and describe three different
speech recognition systems that successfully utilize
the n-gram language models trained for these units
in the corresponding LVCSR tasks.
2 Building the lexicon and language
models
2.1 Unsupervised discovery of morph units
Naturally, there are many ways to split the words
into smaller units to reduce a lexicon to a tractable
size. However, for a subword lexicon suitable
for language modeling applications such as speech
recognition, several properties are desirable:
1. The size of the lexicon should be small enough
that the n-gram modeling becomes more feasi-
ble than the conventional word based modeling.
2. The coverage of the target language by words
that can be built by concatenating the units
should be high enough to avoid the out-of-
vocabulary problem.
3. The units should be somehow meaningful, so
that the previously observed units can help in
predicting the next one.
4. In speech recognition one should be able to de-
termine the pronunciation for each unit.
A common approach to find the subword units
is to program the language-dependent grammatical
rules into a morphological analyzer and utilize that
to then split the text corpus into morphemes as in
e.g. (Hirsim?ki et al, 2005; Alum?e, 2005; Ha-
cioglu et al, 2003). There are some problems re-
lated to ambiguous splits and pronunciations of very
short inflection-type units, but also the coverage in,
e.g., news texts may be poor because of many names
and foreign words.
In this paper we have adopted a similar approach
as (Hirsim?ki et al, 2005). We use unsupervised
learning to find the best units according to some cost
function. In the Morfessor algorithm the minimized
cost is the coding length of the lexicon and the words
in the corpus represented by the units of the lexicon.
This minimum description length based cost func-
tion is especially appealing, because it tends to give
units that are both as frequent and as long as possi-
ble to suit well for both training the language models
and also decoding of the speech. Full coverage of
the language is also guaranteed by splitting the rare
words into very short units, even to single phonemes
if necessary. For language models utilized in speech
488
recognition, the lexicon of the statistical morphs can
be further reduced by omitting the rare words from
the input of the Morfessor algorithm. This operation
does not reduce the coverage of the lexicon, because
it just splits the rare words then into smaller units,
but the smaller lexicon may offer a remarkable speed
up of the recognition.
The pronunciation of, especially, the short units
may be ambiguous and may cause severe problems
in languages like English, in which the pronuncia-
tions can not be adequately determined from the or-
thography. In most agglutinative languages, such as
Finnish, Estonian and Turkish, rather simple letter-
to-phoneme rules are, however, sufficient for most
cases.
2.2 Building the lexicon for open vocabulary
The whole training text corpus is first passed through
a word splitting transformation as in Figure 1. Based
on the learned subword unit lexicon, the best split
for each word is determined by performing a Viterbi
search with the unigram probabilities of the units. At
this point the word break symbols are added between
each word in order to incorporate that information in
the statistical language models, as well. Then the n-
gram models are trained similarly as if the language
units were words including word and sentence break
symbols as additional units.
2.3 Building the n-gram model over morphs
Even though the required morph lexicon is much
smaller than the lexicon for the corresponding word
n-gram estimation, the data sparsity problem is still
important. Interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing is
utilized to tune the language model probabilities in
the same way as found best for the word n-grams.
The n-grams that are not very useful for modeling
the language can be discarded from the model in
order to keep the model size down. For Turkish,
we used the entropy based pruning (Stolcke, 1998),
where the n-grams, that change the model entropy
less than a given treshold, are discarded from the
model. For Finnish and Estonian, we used n-gram
growing (Siivola and Pellom, 2005). The n-grams
that increase the training set likelihood enough with
respect to the corresponding increase in the model
size are accepted into the model (as in the minimum
description length principle). After the growing pro-

cess the model is further pruned with entropy based
pruning. The method allows us to train models with
higher order n-grams, since the memory consump-
tion is lower and also gives somewhat better mod-
els. Both methods can also be viewed as choosing
the correct model complexity for the training data to
avoid over-learning.
3 Statistical properties of Finnish,
Estonian and Turkish
Before presenting the speech recognition results,
some statistical properties are presented for the three
agglutinative languages studied. If we consider
choosing a vocabulary of the 50k-70k most common
words, as usual in English broadcast news LVCSR
systems, the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate in En-
glish is typically smaller than 1%. Using the lan-
guage model training data the following OOV rates
can be found for a vocabulary including only the
most common words: 15% OOV for 69k in Finnish
(Hirsim?ki et al, 2005), 10% for 60k in Estonian
and 9% for 50k in Turkish. As shown in (Hacioglu et
al., 2003) this does not only mean the same amount
of extra speech recognition errors, but even more,
because the recognizer tends to lose track when un-
known words get mapped to those that are in the vo-
cabulary. Even doubling the vocabulary is not a suf-

ficient solution, because a vocabulary twice as large
(120k) would only reduce the OOV rate to 6% in
Estonian and 5% in Turkish. In Finnish even a 400k
vocabulary of the most common words still gives 5%
OOV in the language model training material.
Figure 2 illustrates the vocabulary explosion en-
countered when using words and how using morphs
avoids this problem for Turkish. The figure on the
left shows the vocabulary growth for both words and
morphs. The figure on the right shows the graph
for morphs in more detail. As seen in the figure,
the number of new words encountered continues to
increase as the corpus size gets larger whereas the
number of new morphs encountered levels off.
4 Speech recognition experiments
4.1 About selection of the recognition tasks
In this work the morph-based language models have
been applied in speech recognition for three differ-
ent agglutinative languages, Finnish, Estonian and
Turkish. The recognition tasks are speaker depen-
dent and independent fluent dictation of sentences
taken from newspapers and books, which typically
require very large vocabulary language models.
4.2 Finnish
Finnish is a highly inflected language, in which
words are formed mainly by agglutination and com-
pounding. Finnish is also the language for which the
algorithm for the unsupervised morpheme discovery
(Creutz and Lagus, 2002) was originally developed.
The units of the morph lexicon for the experiments
in this paper were learned from a joint corpus con-
taining newspapers, books and newswire stories of
totally about 150 million words (CSC, 2001). We
obtained a lexicon of 25k morphs by feeding the
learning algorithm with the word list containing the
160k most common words. For language model
training we used the same text corpus and the re-
cently developed growing n-gram training algorithm
(Siivola and Pellom, 2005). The amount of resulted
n-grams are listed in Table 4. The average length
of a morph is such that a word corresponds to 2.52
morphs including a word break symbol.
The speech recognition task consisted of a book
read aloud by one female speaker as in (Hirsim?ki et
al., 2005). Speaker dependent cross-word triphone
models were trained using the first 12 hours of data
and evaluated by the last 27 minutes. The models
included tied state hidden Markov models (HMMs)
of totally 1500 different states, 8 Gaussian mixtures
(GMMs) per state, short-time mel-cepstral features
(MFCCs), maximum likelihood linear transforma-
tion (MLLT) and explicit phone duration models
(Pylkk?nen and Kurimo, 2004). The real-time fac-
tor of recognition speed was less than 10 xRT with
a 2.2 GHz CPU. However, with the efficient LVCSR
decoder utilized (Pylkk?nen, 2005) it seems that by
making an even smaller morph lexicon, such as 10k,
the decoding speed could be optimized to only a few
times real-time without an excessive trade-off with
recognition performance.
4.3 Estonian
Estonian is closely related to Finnish and a similar
language modeling approach was directly applied
to the Estonian recognition task. The text corpus
used to learn the morph units and train the statis-
tical language model consisted of newspapers and
books, altogether about 55 million words (Segakor-
pus, 2005). At first, 45k morph units were obtained
as the best subword unit set from the list of the 470k
most common words in the corpora. For speed-
ing up the recognition, the morph lexicon was after-
wards reduced to 37k by splitting the rarest morphs
(occurring in only one or two words) further into
smaller ones. Corresponding growing n-gram lan-
guage models as in Finnish were trained from the
Estonian corpora resulting the n-grams in Table 4.
The speech recognition task in Estonian consisted
of long sentences read by 50 randomly picked held-
out test speakers, 7 sentences each (a part of (Meister
490
et al, 2002)). Unlike the Finnish and Turkish micro-
phone data, this data was recorded from telephone,
i.e. 8 kHz sampling rate and narrow band data in-
stead of 16 kHz and normal (full) bandwidth. The
phoneme models were trained for speaker indepen-
dent recognition using windowed cepstral mean sub-
traction and significantly more data (over 200 hours
and 1300 speakers) than for the Finnish task. The
speaker independence, together with the telephone
quality and occasional background noises, made this
task still a considerably more difficult one. Other-
wise the acoustic models were similar cross-word
triphone GMM-HMMs with MFCC features, MLLT
transformation and the explicit phone duration mod-
eling, except larger: 5100 different states and 16
GMMs per state. Thus, the recognition speed is
also slower than in Finnish, about 20 xRT (2.2GHz
CPU).
4.4 Turkish
Turkish is another a highly-inflected and agglutina-
tive language with relatively free word order. The
same Morfessor tool (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) as in
Finnish and Estonian was applied to Turkish texts
as well. Using the 360k most common words from
the training corpus, 34k morph units were obtained.
The training corpus consists of approximately 27M
words taken from literature, law, politics, social
sciences, popular science, information technology,
medicine, newspapers, magazines and sports news.
N-gram language models for different orders with
interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing as well as en-
tropy based pruning were built for this morph lexi-
con using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). The
number of n-grams for the highest order we tried (6-
grams without entropy-based pruning) are reported
in Table 4. In average, there are 2.37 morphs per
word including the word break symbol.
The recognition task in Turkish consisted of ap-
proximately one hour of newspaper sentences read
by one female speaker. We used decision-tree state
clustered cross-word triphone models with approx-
imately 5000 HMM states. Instead of using letter
to phoneme rules, the acoustic models were based
directly on letters. Each state of the speaker inde-
pendent HMMs had a GMM with 6 mixture compo-
nents. The HTK frontend (Young et al, 2002) was
used to get the MFCC based acoustic features. The
explicit phone duration models were not applied.
The training data contained 17 hours of speech from
over 250 speakers. Instead of the LVCSR decoder
used in Finnish and Estonian (Pylkk?nen, 2005), the
Turkish evaluation was performed using another de-
coder (AT&T, 2003), Using a 3.6GHz CPU, the real-
time factor was around one.
5 Results
The recognition results for the three different tasks:
Finnish, Estonian and Turkish, are provided in Ta-
bles 1 ? 3. In each task the word error rate (WER)
and letter error rate (LER) statistics for the morph-
based system is compared to a corresponding word-
based system. The resulting morpheme strings are
glued to words according to the word break symbols
included in the language model (see Section 2.2) and
the WER is computed as the sum of substituted, in-
serted and deleted words divided by the correct num-
ber of words. LER is included here as well, because
although WER is a more common measure, it is not
comparable between languages. For example, in ag-
glutinative languages the words are long and contain
a variable amount of morphemes. Thus, any incor-
rect prefix or suffix would make the whole word in-
correct. The n-gram language model statistics are
given in Table 4.

ence 50k (word-based) language model the accuracy
given by 4 and 5-grams did not improve from that of
3-grams.
In the Turkish recognizer the memory constraints
during network optimization (Allauzen et al, 2004)
allowed the use of language models only up to 5-
grams. The language model pruning thresholds were
optimized over a range of values and the best re-
sults are shown in Table 3. We also tried the same
experiments with two-pass recognition. In the first
pass, instead of the best path, lattice output was gen-
erated with the same language models with prun-
ing. Then these lattices were rescored using the non-
pruned 6-gram language models (see Table 4) and
the best path was taken as the recognition output.
For the word-based reference model, the two-pass
recognition gave no improvements. It is likely that
the language model training corpus was too small to
train proper 6-gram word models. However, for the
morph-based model, we obtained a slight improve-
ment (0.7 % absolute) by two-pass recognition.
6 Discussion
The key result of this paper is that we can success-
fully apply the unsupervised statistical morphs in
large vocabulary language models in all the three ex-
perimented agglutinative languages. Furthermore,
the results show that in all the different LVCSR
tasks, the morph-based language models perform
very well and constantly dominate the reference lan-
guage model based on words. The way that the lexi-

con is built from the word fragments allows the con-
struction of statistical language models, in practice,
for almost an unlimited vocabulary by a lexicon that
still has a convenient size.
The recognition was here restricted to agglutina-
tive languages and tasks in which the language used
is both rather general and matches fairly well with
the available training texts. Significant performance
variation in different languages can be observed
here, because of the different tasks and the fact that
comparable recognition conditions and training re-
sources have not been possible to arrange. However,
we believe that the tasks are still both difficult and
realistic enough to illustrate the difference of per-
formance when using language models based on a
lexicon of morphs vs. words in each task. There are
no directly comparable previous LVCSR results on
the same tasks and data, but the closest ones which
can be found are slightly over 20% WER for the
Finnish task (Hirsim?ki et al, 2005), slightly over
40 % WER for the Estonian task (Alum?e, 2005)
and slightly over 30 % WER for the Turkish task
(Erdogan et al, 2005).
Naturally, it is also possible to prepare a huge lex-
icon and still succeed in recognition fairly well (Sar-
aclar et al, 2002; McTait and Adda-Decker, 2003;
Hirsim?ki et al, 2005), but this is not a very con-
venient approach because of the resulting huge lan-
guage models or the heavy pruning required to keep
492
them still tractable. The word-based language mod-
els that were constructed in this paper as reference
models were trained as much as possible in the same
way as the corresponding morph language models.
For Finnish and Estonian the growing n-grams (Sii-
vola and Pellom, 2005) were used including the op-
tion of constructing the OOV words from phonemes
as in (Hirsim?ki et al, 2005). For Turkish a con-
ventional n-gram was built by SRILM similarly as
for the morphs. The recognition approach taken for
Turkish involves a static decoding network construc-
tion and optimization resulting in near real time de-
coding. However, the memory requirements of net-
work optimization becomes prohibitive for large lex-
icon and language models as presented in this paper.
In this paper the recognition speed was not a ma-
jor concern, but from the application point of view
that is a very important factor to be taken into a ac-
count in the comparison. It seems that the major fac-
tors that make the recognition slower are short lexi-
cal units, large lexicon and language models and the
amount of Gaussian mixtures in the acoustic model.
7 Conclusions
This work presents statistical language models
trained on different agglutinative languages utilizing
a lexicon based on the recently proposed unsuper-
vised statistical morphs. To our knowledge this is
the first work in which similarly developed subword
unit lexica are developed and successfully evaluated
in three different LVCSR systems in different lan-
guages. In each case the morph-based approach con-
stantly shows a significant improvement over a con-
ventional word-based LVCSR language models. Fu-
ture work will be the further development of also
the grammatical morph-based language models and
comparison of that to the current approach, as well
as extending this evaluation work to new languages.

Abstract
We analyze subword-based language
models (LMs) in large-vocabulary
continuous speech recognition across
four ?morphologically rich? languages:
Finnish, Estonian, Turkish, and Egyptian
Colloquial Arabic. By estimating n-gram
LMs over sequences of morphs instead
of words, better vocabulary coverage
and reduced data sparsity is obtained.
Standard word LMs suffer from high
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates, whereas
the morph LMs can recognize previously
unseen word forms by concatenating
morphs. We show that the morph LMs
generally outperform the word LMs and
that they perform fairly well on OOVs
without compromising the accuracy
obtained for in-vocabulary words.
1 Introduction
As automatic speech recognition systems are being
developed for an increasing number of languages,
there is growing interest in language modeling ap-
proaches that are suitable for so-called ?morpholog-
ically rich? languages. In these languages, the num-
ber of possible word forms is very large because
of many productive morphological processes; words
are formed through extensive use of, e.g., inflection,
derivation and compounding (such as the English
words ?rooms?, ?roomy?, ?bedroom?, which all stem
from the noun ?room?).
For some languages, language modeling based on
surface forms of words has proven successful, or at
least satisfactory. The most studied language, En-
glish, is not characterized by a multitude of word
forms. Thus, the recognition vocabulary can sim-
ply consist of a list of words observed in the training
text, and n-gram language models (LMs) are esti-
mated over word sequences. The applicability of the
word-based approach to morphologically richer lan-
guages has been questioned. In highly compounding
languages, such as the Germanic languages German,
Dutch and Swedish, decomposition of compound
words can be carried out to reduce the vocabulary
size. Highly inflecting languages are found, e.g.,
among the Slavic, Romance, Turkic, and Semitic
language families. LMs incorporating morphologi-
cal knowledge about these languages can be applied.
A further challenging category comprises languages
that are both highly inflecting and compounding,
such as the Finno-Ugric languages Finnish and Es-
tonian.
Morphology modeling aims to reduce the out-
of-vocabulary (OOV) rate as well as data sparsity,
thereby producing more effective language mod-
els. However, obtaining considerable improvements
in speech recognition accuracy seems hard, as is
demonstrated by the fairly meager improvements
(1?4 % relative) over standard word-based models
accomplished by, e.g., Berton et al (1996), Ordel-
man et al (2003), Kirchhoff et al (2006), Whit-
taker and Woodland (2000), Kwon and Park (2003),
and Shafran and Hall (2006) for Dutch, Arabic, En-
glish, Korean, and Czech, or even the worse perfor-
mance reported by Larson et al (2000) for German
and Byrne et al (2001) for Czech. Nevertheless,
clear improvements over a word baseline have been
achieved for Serbo-Croatian (Geutner et al, 1998),
Finnish, Estonian (Kurimo et al, 2006b) and Turk-
ish (Kurimo et al, 2006a).
In this paper, subword language models in the
recognition of speech of four languages are ana-
380
lyzed: Finnish, Estonian, Turkish, and the dialect
of Arabic spoken in Egypt, Egyptian Colloquial
Arabic (ECA). All these languages are considered
?morphologically rich?, but the benefits of using
subword-based LMs differ across languages. We at-
tempt to discover explanations for these differences.
In particular, the focus is on the analysis of OOVs:
A perceived strength of subword models, when con-
trasted with word models, is that subword models
can generalize to previously unseen word forms by
recognizing them as sequences of shorter familiar
word fragments.
2 Morfessor
Morfessor is an unsupervised, data-driven, method
for the segmentation of words into morpheme-like
units. The general idea is to discover as com-
pact a description of the input text corpus as possi-
ble. Substrings occurring frequently enough in sev-
eral different word forms are proposed as morphs,
and the words in the corpus are then represented
as a concatenation of morphs, e.g., ?hand, hand+s,
left+hand+ed, hand+ful?. Through maximum a pos-
teriori optimization (MAP), an optimal balance is
sought between the compactness of the inventory of
morphs, i.e., the morph lexicon, versus the compact-
ness of the representation of the corpus.
Among others, de Marcken (1996), Brent (1999),
Goldsmith (2001), Creutz and Lagus (2002), and
Creutz (2006) have shown that models based on
the above approach produce segmentations that re-
semble linguistic morpheme segmentations, when
formulated mathematically in a probabilistic frame-
work or equivalently using the Minimum Descrip-
tion Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1989).
Similarly, Goldwater et al (2006) use a hierarchical
Dirichlet model in combination with morph bigram
probabilities.
The Morfessor model has been developed over
the years, and different model versions exist. The
model used in the speech recognition experiments of
the current paper is the original, so-called Morfes-
sor Baseline algorithm, which is publicly available
for download.1. The mathematics of the Morfessor
Baseline model is briefly outlined in the following;
consult Creutz (2006) for details.
1http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/morpho/
2.1 MAP Optimization Criterion
In slightly simplified form, the optimization crite-
rion utilized in the model corresponds to the maxi-
mization of the following posterior probability:
P (lexicon | corpus) ?
P (lexicon) ? P (corpus | lexicon) =
?
letters ?
P (?) ?
?
morphs ?
P (?). (1)
The lexicon consists of all distinct morphs spelled
out; this forms a long string of letters ?, in which
each morph is separated from the next morph using
a morph boundary character. The probability of the
lexicon is the product of the probability of each let-
ter in this string. Analogously, the corpus is repre-
sented as a sequence of morphs, which corresponds
to a particular segmentation of the words in the cor-
pus. The probability of this segmentation equals the
product of the probability of each morph token ?.
Letter and morph probabilities are maximum likeli-
hood estimates (empirical Bayes).
2.2 From Morphs to n-Grams
As a result of the probabilistic (or MDL) approach,
the morph inventory discovered by the Morfessor
Baseline algorithm is larger the more training data
there is. In some speech recognition experiments,
however, it has been desirable to restrict the size of
the morph inventory. This has been achieved by set-
ting a frequency threshold on the words on which
Morfessor is trained, such that the rarest words will
not affect the learning process. Nonetheless, the
rarest words can be split into morphs in accordance
with the model learned, by using the Viterbi algo-
rithm to select the most likely segmentation. The
process is depicted in Figure 1.
2.3 Grapheme-to-Phoneme Mapping
The mapping between graphemes (letters) and
phonemes is straightforward in the languages stud-
ied in the current paper. More or less, there is
a one-to-one correspondence between letters and
phonemes. That is, the spelling of a word indicates
the pronunciation of the word, and when splitting the
word into parts, the pronunciation of the parts in iso-
lation does not differ much from the pronunciation
of the parts in context. However, a few exceptions

have been treated more rigorously in the Arabic ex-
periments: e.g., in some contexts the same (spelled)
morph can have multiple possible pronunciations.
3 Experiments and Analysis
The goal of the conducted experiments is to com-
pare n-gram language models based on morphs to
standard word n-gram models in automatic speech
recognition across languages.
3.1 Data Sets and Recognition Systems
The results from eight different tests have been an-
alyzed. Some central properties of the test config-
urations are shown in Table 1. The Finnish, Esto-
nian, and Turkish test configurations are slight vari-
ations of experiments reported earlier in Hirsima?ki
et al (2006) (Fin1: ?News task?, Fin2: ?Book task?),
Kurimo et al (2006a) (Fin3, Tur1), and Kurimo et
al. (2006b) (Fin4, Est, Tur2).
Three different recognition platforms have been
used, all of which are state-of-the-art large vocab-
ulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) sys-
tems. The Finnish and Estonian experiments have
been run on the HUT speech recognition system de-
veloped at Helsinki University of Technology.
The Turkish tests were performed using the
AT&T decoder (Mohri and Riley, 2002); the acous-
tic features were produced using the HTK front end
(Young et al, 2002). The experiments on Egyptian
Colloquial Arabic (ECA) were carried out using the
SRI DecipherTM speech recognition system.
3.1.1 Speech Data and Acoustic Models
The type and amount of speech data vary from
one language to another. The Finnish data con-
sists of news broadcasts read by one single female
speaker (Fin1), as well as an audio book read by an-
other female speaker (Fin2, Fin3, Fin4). The Finnish
acoustic models are speaker dependent (SD). Mono-
phones (mon) were used in the earlier experiments
(Fin1, Fin2), but these were later replaced by cross-
context triphones (tri).
The Estonian speech data has been collected from
a large number of speakers and consists of sen-
tences from newspapers as well as names and dig-
its read aloud. The acoustic models are speaker-
independent triphones (SI tri) adapted online using
Cepstral Mean Subtraction and Constrained Maxi-
mum Likelihood Linear Regression. Also the Turk-
ish acoustic training data contains speech from hun-
dreds of speakers. The test set is composed of news-
paper text read by one female speaker. Speaker-
independent triphones are used as acoustic models.
The Finnish, Estonian, and Turkish data sets con-
tain planned speech, i.e., written text read aloud.
By contrast, the Arabic data consists of transcribed
spontaneous telephone conversations,2 which are
characterized by disfluencies and by the presence
of ?non-speech?, such as laugh and cough sounds.
There are multiple speakers in the Arabic data, and
online speaker adaptation has been performed.
3.1.2 Text Data and Language Models
The n-gram language models are trained using
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) (Fin1, Fin2,
Tur1, Tur2, ECA) or similar software developed
at HUT (Siivola and Pellom, 2005) (Fin3, Fin4,
Est). All models utilize the Modified Interpolated
Kneser-Ney smoothing technique (Chen and Good-
man, 1999). The Arabic LM is trained on the
same corpus that is used for acoustic training. This
data set is regrettably small (160 000 words), but it
matches the test set well in style, as it consists of
transcribed spontaneous speech. The LM training
corpora used for the other languages contain fairly
large amounts of mainly news and book texts and
conceivably match the style of the test data well.
In the morph-based models, words are split into
morphs using Morfessor, and statistics are collected
for morph n-grams. As the desired output of the

speech recognizer is a sequence of words rather than
morphs, the LM explicitly models word breaks as
special symbols occurring in the morph sequence.
For comparison, word n-gram models have been
tested. The vocabulary cannot typically include ev-
ery word form occurring in the training set (because
of the large number of different words), so the most
frequent words are given priority; the actual lexicon
sizes used in each experiment are shown in Table 1.
Any word not contained in the lexicon is replaced by
a special out-of-vocabulary symbol.
As words and morphs are units of different length,
their optimal performance may occur at different or-
ders of the n-gram. The best order of the n-gram
has been optimized on development test sets in the
following cases: Fin1, Fin2, Tur1, ECA (4-grams
for both morphs and words) and Tur2 (5-grams for
morphs, 3-grams for words). The models have ad-
ditionally been pruned using entropy-based pruning
(Tur1, Tur2, ECA) (Stolcke, 1998). In the other
experiments (Fin3, Fin4, Est), no fixed maximum
value of n was selected. n-Gram growing was per-
formed (Siivola and Pellom, 2005), such that those
n-grams that maximize the training set likelihood
are gradually added to the model. The unrestricted
growth of the model is counterbalanced by an MDL-
type complexity term. The highest order of n-grams
accepted was 7 for Finnish and 8 for Estonian.
Note that the optimization procedure is neutral
with respect to morphs vs. words. Roughly the
same number of parameters are allowed in the result-
ing LMs, but typically the morph n-gram LMs are
smaller than the corresponding word n-gram LMs.
3.1.3 Out-of-Vocabulary Words
Table 1 further shows statistics on out-of-
vocabulary rates in the data sets. This is relevant
for the assessment of the word models, as the OOV
rates define the limits of these models.
The OOV rate for the LM training set corresponds
to the proportion of words replaced by the OOV
symbol in the LM training data, i.e., words that were
not included in the recognition vocabulary. The high
OOV rates for Estonian (14 %) and Tur2 (9.6 %) in-
dicate that the word lexicons have poor coverage of
these sets. By contrast, the ECA word lexicon cov-
ers virtually the entire training set vocabulary.
Correspondingly, the test set OOV rate is the pro-
portion of words that occur in the data sets used
for running the speech recognition tests, but that are
missing from the recognition lexicons. This value
is thus the minimum error that can be obtained by
the word models, or put differently, the recognizer
is guaranteed to get at least this proportion of words
wrong. Again, the values are very high for Estonian
(19 %) and Tur2 (12 %), but also for Arabic (9.9 %)
because of the insufficient amount of training data.
Finally, the figures labeled ?new words in test set?
denote the proportion of words in the test set that do
not occur in the LM training set. Thus, these values
indicate the minimum error achievable by any word
model trained on the training sets available.

recognition test configurations.
3.2 Results and Analysis
The morph-based and word-based results of the con-
ducted speech recognition experiments are shown in
Figure 2 (for Fin4, no comparable word experiment
has been carried out). The evaluation measure used
is word accuracy (WAC): the number of correctly
recognized words minus the number of incorrectly
inserted words divided by the number of words in
the reference transcript. (Another frequently used
measure is the word error rate, WER, which relates
to word accuracy as WER = 100 % ? WAC.)
Figure 2 shows that the morph models perform
better than the word models, with the exception
of the Arabic experiment (ECA), where the word
model outperforms the morph model. The statisti-
cal significance of these differences is confirmed by
one-tailed paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests at the
significance level of 0.05.
Overall, the best performance is observed for the
Finnish data sets, which is explained by the speaker-
dependent acoustic models and clean noise condi-
tions. The Arabic setup suffers from the insufficient
amount of LM training data.
3.2.1 In-Vocabulary Words
For a further investigation of the outcome of the
experiments, the test sets have been partitioned into
regions based on the types of words they contain.
The recognition output is aligned with the refer-
ence transcript, and the regions aligned with in-
vocabulary (IV) reference words (words contained
in the vocabulary of the word model) are put in
one partition and the remaining words (OOVs) are
put in another partition. Word accuracies are then
computed separately for the two partitions. Inserted
words, i.e., words that are not aligned with any word
in the reference, are put in the IV partition, unless
they are adjacent to an OOV region, in which case
they are put in the OOV partition.
Figure 3a shows word accuracies for the in-
vocabulary words. Without exception, the accuracy
for the IVs is higher than that of the entire test set vo-
cabulary. One could imagine that the word models
would do better than the morph models on the IVs,
since the word models are totally focused on these
words, whereas the morph models reserve modeling
capacity for a much larger set of words. The word
accuracies in Fig. 3a also partly seem to support this
view. However, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (level
0.05) show that the superiority of the word model is
statistically significant only for Arabic and for Fin3.
With few exceptions, it is thus possible to draw
the conclusion that morph models are capable of
modeling a much larger set of words than word
models without, however, compromising the perfor-
mance on the limited vocabulary covered by the
word models in a statistically significant way.
3.2.2 Out-of-Vocabulary Words
Since the word model and morph model perform
equally well on the subset of words that are included
in the lexicon of the word model, the overall supe-
riority of the morph model needs to come from its
successful coping with out-of-vocabulary words.
In Figure 3b, word accuracies have been plot-
ted for the out-of-vocabulary words contained in the
test set. It is clear that the recognition accuracy for
the OOVs is much lower than the overall accuracy.
Also, negative accuracy values are observed. This
happens when the number of insertions exceeds the
number of correctly recognized units.
In Figure 3b, if speaker-dependent and speaker-
independent setups are considered separately (and
Arabic is left out), there is a tendency for the morph
models to recognize the OOVs more accurately, the
higher the OOV rate is. One could say that a morph
model has a double advantage over a correspond-
ing word model: the larger the proportion of OOVs

in the word model is, the larger the proportion of
words that the morph model can recognize but the
word model cannot, a priori. In addition, the larger
the proportion of OOVs, the more frequent and more
?easily modelable? words are left out of the word
model, and the more successfully these words are
indeed learned by the morph model.
3.2.3 New Words in the Test Set
All words present in the training data (some of
which are OOVs in the word models) ?leave some
trace? in the morph models, in the n-gram statistics
that are collected for morph sequences. How, then,
about new words that occur only in the test set, but
not in the training set? In order to recognize such
words correctly, the model must combine morphs in
ways it has not observed before.
Figure 4 demonstrates that the new unseen words
are very challenging. Now, also the morph mod-
els mostly obtain negative word accuracies, which
means that the number of insertions adjacent to new
words exceeds the number of correctly recognized
new words. The best results are obtained in clean
acoustic conditions (Fin2, Fin3, Fin4) with only few
foreign names, which are difficult to get right using
typical Finnish phoneme-to-grapheme mappings (as
the negative accuracy of Fin1 suggests).
3.3 Vocabulary Growth and Arabic
Figure 5 shows the development of the size of
the vocabulary (unique word forms) for growing
amounts of text in different corpora. The corpora
used for Finnish, Estonian, and Turkish (planned
speech/text), as well as Arabic (spontaneous speech)
are the LM training sets used in the experiments.
Additional sources have been provided for Arabic
and English: Arabic text (planned) from the FBIS
corpus of Modern Standard Arabic (a collection
of transcribed radio newscasts from various radio
stations in the Arabic speaking world), as well as
text from the New York Times magazine (English
planned) and spontaneous transcribed English tele-
phone conversations from the Fisher corpus.
The figure illustrates two points: (1) The faster
the vocabulary growth is, the larger the potential ad-
vantage of morph models is in comparison to stan-
dard word models, because of OOV and data spar-
sity problems. The obtained speech recognition re-
sults seem to support this hypothesis; the applied
morph LMs are clearly beneficial for Finnish and
Estonian, mostly beneficial for Turkish, and slightly
detrimental for ECA. (2) A more slowly growing
vocabulary is used in spontaneous speech than in
planned speech (or written text). Moreover, the
Arabic ?spontaneous? curve is located fairly close

Words
Figure 4: Word accuracies computed for the words
in the test sets that do not occur at all in the train-

entire test sets (also displayed in Figure 2).
to the English ?planned? curve and much below
the Finnish, Estonian, and Turkish curves. Thus,
even though Arabic is considered a ?morphologi-
cally rich? language, this is not manifested through
a considerable vocabulary growth (and high OOV
rate) in the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic data used in
the current speech recognition experiments. Conse-
quently, it may not be that surprising that the morph
model did not work particularly well for Arabic.
Arabic words consist of a stem surrounded by pre-
fixes and suffixes, which are fairly successfully seg-
mented out by Morfessor. However, Arabic also
has templatic morphology, i.e., the stem is formed
through the insertion of a vowel pattern into a ?con-
sonantal skeleton?.
Additional experiments have been performed us-
ing the ECA data and Factored Language Models
(FLMs) (Kirchhoff et al, 2006). The FLM is a
powerful model that makes use of several sources
of information, in particular a morphological lexi-
con of ECA. The FLM incorporates mechanisms for
handling templatic morphology, but despite its so-
phistication, it barely outperforms the standard word
model: The word accuracy of the FLM is 42.3 % and
that of the word model is 41.8 %. The speech recog-
nition implementation of both the FLM and the word

model is based on whole words (although subword
units are used for assigning probabilities to word
forms in the FLM). This contrasts these models with
the morph model, which splits words into subword
units also in the speech recognition implementation.
It seems that the splitting is a source of errors in this
experimental setup with very little data available.
4 Discussion
Alternative morph-based and word-based ap-
proaches exist. We have tried some, but none of
them has outperformed the described morph models
for Finnish, Estonian, and Turkish, or the word and
FLM models for Egyptian Arabic (in a statistically
significant way). The tested models comprise
more linguistically accurate morph segmentations
obtained using later Morfessor versions (Categories-
ML and Categories-MAP) (Creutz, 2006), as well
as analyses obtained from morphological parsers.
Hybrids, i.e., word models augmented with
phonemes or other subword units have been pro-
posed (Bazzi and Glass, 2000; Galescu, 2003;
Bisani and Ney, 2005). In our experiments, such
models have outperformed the standard word mod-
els, but not the morph models.
Simply growing the word vocabulary to cover the
386
entire vocabulary of large training corpora could be
one (fairly ?brute-force?) approach, but this is hardly
feasible for languages such as Finnish. The en-
tire Finnish LM training data of 150 million words
(used in Fin4) contains more than 4 million unique
word forms, a value ten times the size of the rather
large word lexicon currently used. And even if a 4-
million-word lexicon were to be used, the OOV rate
of the test set would still be relatively high: 1.5 %.
Judging by the Arabic experiments, there seems
to be some potential in Factored Language Models.
The FLMs might work well also for the other lan-
guages, and in fact, to do justice to the more ad-
vanced morph models from later versions of Mor-
fessor, FLMs or some other refined techniques may
be necessary as a complement to the currently used
standard n-grams.
