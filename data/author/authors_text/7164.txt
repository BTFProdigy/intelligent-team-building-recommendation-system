Abstract
In this paper we present a thorough
evaluation of a corpus resource for
Portuguese, CETEMP?blico, a 180-
million word newspaper corpus free
for R&D in Portuguese processing.
We provide information that should
be useful to those using the resource,
and to considerable improvement for
later versions. In addition, we think
that the procedures presented can be
of interest for the larger NLP
community, since corpus evaluation
and description is unfortunately not a
common exercise.
 
CETEMP?blico is a large corpus of European
Portuguese newspaper language, available at no
cost to the community dealing with the
processing of Portuguese.1 It was created in the
framework of the Computational Processing of
Portuguese project, a government funded
initiative to foster language engineering of the
Portuguese language.2
Evaluating this resource, we have two main
goals in mind: To contribute to improve its
usefulness; and to suggest ways of going about
as far as corpus evaluation is concerned in
general (noting that most corpora projects are
simply described and not evaluated).

In fact, and despite the amount of research
devoted to corpus processing nowadays, there is
not much information about the actual corpora
being processed, which may lead na?ve users
and/or readers to conclude that this is not an
interesting issue. In our opinion, that is the
wrong conclusion.
There is, in fact, a lot to be said about any
particular corpus. We believe, in addition, that
such information should be available when one
is buying, or even just browsing, a corpus, and it
should be taken into consideration when, in turn,
systems or hypotheses are evaluated with the
help of that corpus.
In this paper, we will solely be concerned
with CETEMP?blico, but it is our belief that
similar kinds of information could be published
about different corpora. Our intention is to give
a positive contribution both to the whole
community involved in the processing of
Portuguese and to the particular users of this
corpus. At the moment of writing, 160 people
have ordered (and, we assume, consequently
received) it3. There have also been more than
four thousand queries via the Web site which
gives access to the corpus.
We want to provide evaluation data and
describe how one can improve the corpus. We
are genuinely interested in increasing its value,
and have, since corpus release,4 made available
four patches (e-mailing this information to all

 Although we also made available a CQP (Christ et al,
1999) encoded version in March 2001, the vast majority of
the users received the text-only version.

 The corpus was ready in July 2000; the first copies were
sent out in October, with the information that version 1.0
creation date was 25 July 2000.
who ordered the corpus). We have also tried to
considerably improve the Web page.
We decided to concentrate on the evaluation
of version 1.0, given that massive distribution
was done of that particular version5. Web
access to the corpus (Santos and Bick, 2000)
will not be dealt with here. Note that all trivial
improvements described here have already been
addressed in some patch.
 	
As described in detail in Rocha and Santos
(2000) and also in the FAQ at the corpus Web
page, CETEMP?blico was built from the raw
material provided by the Portuguese daily
newspaper P?blico: text files in Macintosh
format, covering approximately the years 1991
to 1998, and including both published news
articles and those created but not necessarily
brought to print. These files were automatically
tagged with a classification based on, but not
identical to, the one used by the newspaper to
identify sections, and with the semester the
article was associated to. In addition, sentence
separation, and title and author identification
were automatically created. The texts were then
divided in extracts with an average length of
two paragraphs. These extracts were randomly
shuffled (for copyright reasons) and numbered,
and the final corpus was the ordered sequence
of the extract numbers.
To illustrate the corpus in text format, we
present in Appendix A an extract that includes
all possible tags with the exception of <marca>.
 
We start by commenting on the distribution
process, and then go on to analyse the corpus
contents and the specific options chosen in its
creation.
Let us first comment on the distribution
options. While this resource is entirely free
(one has just to register in a Web page in order
to receive the corpus at the address of one?s
choice), several critical remarks are not out of
place:
                                                     
5
 We have no estimate of how many users have actually
succeeded, or even tried, to apply the patches made
available later on. We have just launched a Web
questionnaire in order to have a better idea of our user
community.
First of all, when publicizing the resource, it
was not clear for whom the CD distribution was
actually meant: Later on, we discovered that
many traditional linguists ordered it just to find
out that they were much better off with the on-
line version.
Second, more accompanying information in
the CD would not hurt, instead of pointing to a
Web page as the only source: In fact, the
assumption that everyone has access to the Web
while working with CETEMP?blico is not
necessarily true in Portugal or Brazil.
Finally, we did not produce a medium-size
technical description; in addition to the FAQ on
the Web page, we provided only a full paper
(Rocha and Santos, 2000) describing the whole
project, arguably an overkill.
About the corpus contents, several
fundamental decisions can ? and actually have,
in previous conferences or by e-mail ? be
criticized, in particular the use of a single text
source and the inclusion of sentence tags (by
criteria so far not yet documented). Still, we
think that both are easy to defend, since 1) the
time taken in copyright handling and contract
writing with every copyright owner strongly
suggests minimizing their number. And 2)
although sentence separation is a controversial
issue, it is straightforward to dispose of
sentence separation tags. So, this option cannot
really be considered an obstacle to users.6
We will concentrate instead on each
annotation, after discussing the choice of texts
and extracts.

Abstract
In this paper we describe the first evalu-
ation contest (track) for Portuguese whose
goal was to detect and classify relations be-
tween named entities in running text, called
ReRelEM. Given a collection annotated with
named entities belonging to ten different se-
mantic categories, we marked all relationships
between them within each document. We used
the following fourfold relationship classifi-
cation: identity, included-in, located-in, and
other (which was later on explicitly detailed
into twenty different relations). We provide a
quantitative description of this evaluation re-
source, as well as describe the evaluation ar-
chitecture and summarize the results of the
participating systems in the track.
1 Motivation
Named entity recognition can be considered the first
step towards semantic analysis of texts and a crucial
subtask of information extraction systems. Proper
names, besides their high frequency in language, do
more than just refer ? they convey additional infor-
mation as instances of general semantic categories.
But NE recognition is, as just mentioned, only the
first step for full language processing. If we want to
go beyond the detection of entities, a natural step is
establishing semantic relations between these enti-
ties, and this is what this paper is about.
There are two fairly independent communities
that focus on the task of detecting relations between
named entities: the work on anaphora resolution, il-
lustrated by (Mitkov, 2000; Collovini et al, 2007;
de Souza et al, 2008) and the work on relation de-
tection in information extraction, see e.g. (Agichtein
and Gravano, 2000; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Cu-
lotta and Sorensen, 2004). Although both commu-
nities are doing computational semantics, the two
fields are largely non-overlapping, and one of the
merits of our work is that we tried to merge the two.
Let us briefly describe both traditions: as (Mitkov,
2000) explains, anaphora resolution is concerned
with studying the linguistic phenomenon of pointing
back to another expression in the text. The seman-
tic relations between the referents of these expres-
sions can be of different types, being co-reference a
special case when the relation is identity. The focus
of anaphora resolution is determining the antecedent
chains, although it implicitly also allows to elicit se-
mantic relations between referents. This task has a
long tradition in natural language processing (NLP)
since the early days of artificial intelligence (Web-
ber, 1978), and has from the start been considered a
key ingredient in text understanding.
A different tradition, within information extrac-
tion and ontology building, is devoted to fact ex-
traction. The detection of relations involving named
entities is seen as a step towards a more structured
model of the meaning of a text. The main concerns
here (see e.g. (Zhao and Grishman, 2005)) are the
extraction of large quantities of facts, generally cou-
pled with machine learning approaches.1
Although mentions of named entities may ex-
1Other authors use the term relation detection in still other
ways: for example, (Roth and tau Yih, 2004) use it for the trans-
lation of any natural language sentences into ?logical form?, as
in kill (x,y). This task does not concern us here.

press semantic relations other than identity or de-
pendency, the main focus of the first school has
been limited to co-reference. Yet, relations such
as part-of have been considered under the label
of indirect anaphora, also known as associative or
bridging anaphora.
Contrarywise, the list of relations of interest for
the second school is defined simply by world knowl-
edge (not linguistic clues), and typical are the rela-
tions between an event and its location, or an orga-
nization and its headquarters. Obviously, these rela-
tions do occur between entities that do not involve
(direct or indirect) anaphora in whatever broad un-
derstanding of the term.
Also, relation detection in the second school does
not usually cover identity (cf. ACE?s seven relation
types): identity or co-reference is often considered
an intermediate step before relation extraction (Cu-
lotta and Sorensen, 2004).
Table 1 displays a non-exhaustive overview of the
different relations found in the literature.2
In devising the ReRelEM3 pilot track, our goal
was twofold: to investigate which relations could
2There is overlap between ACE 2007 and 2004 types of re-
lations. In order to ease the comparison, we used the names of
subtypes for ACE relations.

Entidades Mencionadas, Portuguese for ?recognition of rela-
tions between named entities?, see (Freitas et al, 2008).
be found between named entities in Portuguese text,
and how could a pilot task be devised that compared
the performance of different automatic systems sup-
posed to identify them. It should be emphasized that
both MUC and ACE were key inspiration sources for
ReRelEM, which stems from Linguateca?s emphasis
on evaluation.
In fact, we were conversant with MUC co-
reference track and the way it was scored, as well
as aware of two other related evaluation contests:
ACE (Doddington et al, 2004; NIST and ACE,
2007), which extended MUC by dropping the re-
quirement that entities had to be named, and ARE
(Ora?san et al, 2008), which requested the identifi-
cation of an anaphoric relation in certain types of
pre-defined relations (identity, synonymy, general-
ization and specification), but which ignored indirect
anaphora (that may convey meronymy, or inclusion,
in a broad sense).
ReRelEM, although maintaining (or adding) the
restriction to named entitites, is, from our point of
view, an advance in the field of relation detection,
since we proposed the detection (and classification)
of all (relevant) kinds of relations between NEs in a
document, providing thus both a merge and an ex-
tension of the previous evaluation campaigns.

2 Track description
The purpose of ReRelEM is to assess systems that
try to recognize the most relevant relations between
named entities, even if those relations do not involve
coreference or anaphora.
2.1 Context
In order for it to be feasible in the short time we
had, the track definition required that both referring
expression and their semantic referent were named
entities. Pronouns and definite descriptions were
hence excluded. Note also that ReRelEM was de-
fined in the context of the second edition of a larger
evaluation contest dealing with NE detection and
classification in Portuguese, HAREM (Santos et al,
2008) (for a detailed description of HAREM, in Por-
tuguese, see also (Santos and Cardoso, 2007; Mota
and Santos, 2008)). HAREM required systems to
choose among ten categories (see Table 2), 43 types
and 21 subtypes, the later concerning the categories
TEMPO (time) and LOCAL (place).
So, it should be emphasized that ReRelEM fo-
cuses only on the classification and detection of
the relations, not limiting in any way the kinds of
(named) entities that can be related (as usualy done
in other detection tasks). It only enforces the kinds
of relations that must be identified.
2.2 Relation inventory
The establishment of an inventory of the most rele-
vant relations between NEs is ultimately subjective,
depending on the kind of information that each par-
ticipant aims to extract. We have nevertheless done
an exploratory study and annotated exhaustively a
few texts to assess the most frequent and less con-
troversial (or easier to assign) relations, and came
up with just the following relation types for the task
proposal:
? identity (ident);
? inclusion (inclui (includes) or incluido
(included));
? placement (ocorre-em (occurs-in) or
sede-de (place-of));
? other (outra)
For further description and examples see section 3.
However, during the process of building
ReRelEM?s golden collection (a subset of the
HAREM collection used as gold standard), human
annotation was felt to be more reliable ? and also
more understandable ? if one specified what ?other?
actually meant, and so a further level of detail
(twenty new relations) was selected and marked,
see Table 3. (In any case, since this new refinement
did not belong to the initial task description, all
were mapped back to the coarser outra relation
for evaluation purposes.)
2.3 ReRelEM features and HAREM
requirements
The annotation process began after the annotation
of HAREM?s golden collection, that is, the relations
started to be annotated after all NE had been tagged
and totally revised. For ReRelEM, we had therefore
no say in that process ? again, ReRelEM was only
concerned with the relations between the classified
NEs. However, our detailed consideration of rela-
tions helped to uncover ? and correct some mistakes
in the original classification.
In order to explain the task(s) at hand, let us de-
scribe shortly ReRelEM?s syntax: In ReRelEM?s
golden collection, each NE has a unique ID. A re-
lation between NE is indicated by the additional at-
tributes COREL (filled with the ID of the related en-
tity) and TIPOREL (filled with the name of the re-
lation) present in the NE that corresponds to one of
the arguments of the relation. (Actually, there?s no
difference if the relation is marked in the first or in
the second argument.)
131
One referring expression can be associated with
one or more NEs through several semantic relations.
In such cases, all possible relations must be assigned
to the referring expression, in the form of a list, as
illustrated by UTAD in Figure 1.
In this example, the NE with name UTAD (and
id ex1-42) corresponds to an acronym of Univer-
sidade de Tra?s-os-Montes e Alto Douro (a univer-
sity in Portugal), maintaining with this entity an
identity relation (ident). The TIPOREL field of
ex1-42 contains another relation, inclui, which
stands for the relation of inclusion, this time with
the previously mentioned Servic?os Administrativos
(ex1-40), a specific department of the university.
In order to minimize human labour and also to
let systems mark relations the way it would better
suit them, we have postulated from the start that, for
all purposes, it would be equivalent to annotate ev-
erything or just enough relations so that all others
can be automatically computed. So, the evaluation
programs, in an obvious extension of what was pro-
posed in (Vilain et al, 1995) for identity,
1. add/expand all relations with their inverses
(e.g., ?A includes B? entails ?B is included in
A?), and
2. apply a set of expansion rules (see examples in
Table 4) to compute the closure
As a consequence, different systems may tag the
same text in different ways, but encoding the same
knowledge.
2.4 What is a relevant relation?
An important difference as to what we expect as rel-
evant relations should be pointed out: instead of re-
quiring explicit (linguistic) clues, as in traditional
research on anaphor, we look for all relations that
may make sense in the specific context of the whole
document. Let us provide two arguments supporting
this decision:
? the first one is philosophical: the borders be-
tween world knowledge and contextual infer-
ence can be unclear in many cases, so it is not
easy to distinguish them, even if we did believe
in that separation in the first place;
? the second is practical: marking all possible re-
lations is a way to also deal with unpredictable
informational needs, for example for text min-
ing applications. Take a sentence like ?When I
lived in Peru, I attended a horse show and was
able to admire breeds I had known only from
pictures before, like Falabella and Paso.?. From
this sentence, few people would infer that Paso
is a Peruvian breed, but a horse specialist might
at once see the connection. The question is:
should one identify a relation between Peru and
Paso in this document? We took the affirmative
decision, assuming the existence of users inter-
ested in the topic: ?relation of breeds to horse
shows: are local breeds predominant??.
However, and since this was the first time such eval-
uation contest was run, we took the following mea-
sure: we added the attribute INDEP to the cases
where the relation was not possible to be inferred
by the text. In this way, it is possible to assess
the frequency of these cases in the texts, and one
may even filter them out before scoring the system
runs to check their weight in the ranking of the sys-
tems. Interestingly, there were very few cases (only
6) marked INDEP in the annotated collection.
3 Qualitative relation description
Identity (or co-reference) does not need to be ex-
plained, although we should insist that this is not
identity of expression, but of meaning. So the same
string does not necessarily imply identity, cf.:
Os adeptos do Porto invadiram a cidade
do Porto em ju?bilo.4
Interestingly, even though organization is only the
third most frequent category, Figure 2 shows that we
found more co-reference among organizations than
among any other category.
As to inclusion (see Figure 3), it was defined be-
tween NEs of the same sort, as the folowing ex-
amples, respectively illustrating LOCAL, PESSOA,
OBRA and ORGANIZACAO, show:

Placement is clearly skewed towards placement of
organizations (518 cases) as opposed to occurrence
of events (just 98 instances). However, if we con-
sider the relative distribution of organizations and
events (see Table 2), we can state that, relative to
their places, events have 4.8 relations in average and
organizations 5.0, which is a far more interesting re-
sult, not favouring any of the NE classes.
Examples of this relation are:

3.1 Vague categories
It is important to stress that the basic tenets of
HAREM had to be followed or reckoned with, not
only the classification grid (see Table 2) but par-
ticularly the fact that some named entities are con-
sidered to be vague among different categories in

This last property, namely that named entities
could belong to more than one category, posed some
problems, since it was not straightforward whether
different relations would involve all or just some (or
one) category. So, in order to specify clearly the
relations between vague NEs, we decided to spec-
ify separate relations between facets of vague named
entities. Cf. the following example, in which vague-
ness is conveyed by a slash:
(...) a ideia de uma Europa (LO-
CAL/PESSOA) unida. (...) um dia feliz
para as cidada?s e os cidada?os da Unia?o
Europeia (LOCAL). (...) Somos essen-
cialmente uma comunidade de valores ?
sa?o estes valores comuns que constituem
o fundamento da Unia?o Europeia (AB-
STRACCAO/ORG/LOCAL).11
10This is different from considering metonymy classes, in
that no classifications are considered more basic than others, see
(Santos, 2006) for vagueness as an intrinsic property of natural
language.
11the idea of a united Europe (...) a happy day for the citizens
The several relations between the three bold-faced
NEs have been found to be as follows: The LO-
CAL facet of the first NE is identical with the LO-
CAL facets of the second and third NEs, while the
ORG(ANIZACAO) facet of the third NE is located
in the LOCAL facet of the second and first NEs.
(Two kinds of relations are therefore involved here:
ident and inclui.)
4 Evaluation: architecture and measures
Our first concern in this pilot track was to make a
clear separation between the evaluation of relations
and the evaluation of NE detection, which was the
goal of HAREM. So, ReRelEM ?s evaluation uses as
a starting point the set of alignments that correspond
to a mapping of the NE in the golden collection (GC)
to a (candidate) NE in the participation.
Evaluation has the following stages:
? Maximization: the sets of relations annotated in
both the GC and in the participation are maxi-
mized, applying the rules in Table 4;
? Selection: the alignments where the NE in the
GC is different from the corresponding one in

Each triple is scored as correct, missing or incor-
rect. We only considered as correct triples (and cor-
rect relations) those which linked the correct NEs
and whose relation was well classified. So, a system
doesn?t score if it correctly matches the NEs to be re-
lated, but fails to recognize the kind of relation. We
assign one point to each correct relation and none to
incorrect or missing relations, and then we compute
precision, recall and F-measure.
ReRelEM?s golden collection includes 12 texts
with 4,417 words and 573 NEs (corresponding to
642 different facets). In all we annotated 6,790 re-
lations (1436 identity; 1612 inclusion; 1232 place-
ment; 2510 other).
5 Participation and results
For this first edition, only three systems (totalling
nine runs) participated, namely REMBRANDT
(Cardoso, 2008), SEI-Geo (Chaves, 2008), and
SeRelEP (Bruckschen et al, 2008), whose results
are found in Figure 4. However, they did not com-
pare well: they selected different NER tasks and dif-
ferent relation types, as shown in Table 5. So, given
the little and diverse participation in ReRelEM, we
cannot do a useful state of the art, but we were def-
initely able to provide an interesting and important
resource for empirical studies and for training of fu-
ture systems, as well as a set of publicly available
programs to manipulate, evaluate and display this

kind of semantic data13.
6 Discussion and further work
Although this was just a pilot, a lot of knowledge
about the task and the problems to be dealt with were
gathered for the future, and important resources
were offered to the community.
We intend to annotate further sections of the
HAREM golden collection (as well as other kinds
of texts and materials) with more relations in order
to have more quantitative empirical data for studying
the semantic fabric of Portuguese.
Although from an organization point of view it
made sense to couple ReRelEM with HAREM, one
should reflect over the consequences of inheriting a
lot of decisions taken in HAREM, somehow going
counter the intuitive and easier task of just annotat-
ing relations in a first round. However, despite initial
fears to the contrary, we found out that the consid-
erably fine-grained HAREM grid was in fact benefi-
cial to the task of specifying relations: it is, after all,
much more informative to have a relation of inclu-
sion between a COISA-MEMBROCLASSE (concrete
instance of a class of objects) and a COISA-CLASSE
(a class of objects), than just a relation of inclusion
13http://www.linguateca.pt/HAREM/

tout court. In fact, in the next sentence, a kind of
specialization relation can be uncovered.

Likewise, an inclusion relation held between
PESSOA-GRUPOCARGO (a group of roles performed
by people) and PESSOA-INDIVIDUAL (an individ-
ual person) , as in the following example, is more
informative than a simple relation of inclusion be-
tween NEs, or even inclusion between PESSOA enti-
ties without further discrimination.

an inclusion relation held between PESSOA-

Conversely, the specification of relations between
different NEs in a text may help in detecting and jus-
tifying different facets of a particular NE, i.e., mul-
tiple semantic categories that should be assigned to
it.
This illustrates the often observed case that it may
be easier for a human annotator to decide and choose
a specific issue than a too general one, and that there-
fore categories or choices should be more dependent
on ease of human interpretation than quantitative
factors (such as few categories or balanced ones).

For future work, we obviously intend to increase
the size of the annotated collection (to the whole
HAREM collection and even beyond), and investi-
gate a couple of issues that interest us: which strate-
gies are used to avoid repetition of proper names
and establish textual cohesion? How do relations
between noun phrases in general compare with re-
lations between entities?
We would also like to investigate closer rela-
tionships between different relations: for exam-
ple, is it more appropriate to also develop a hi-
erarchy of relations, reconsidering, for example,
affiliation (currently one of the other) as a
kind of inclusion?
In order to understand better what this task is
about, we would also like to investigate whether
there are interesting correlations between NE cate-
gories and relations, as well as text genre and this
sort of connectivity. Even though we only studied
and annotated in depth 12 different texts, it was at
once obvious that they had quite different properties
as far as the number and kinds of relations was con-
cerned.
From an evaluation point of view, we would like
to improve our inconsistency detection programs
and be able to reason about possible contradictions
(of the annotation or of the interpretation) as well
as experiment with different weights and evaluation
measures, taking into account criteria such as pre-
dictability of relationships between NEs.
In any case, we believe this was an important first
step to understand a number of issues and to reflect
about what computational systems should be doing
to harvest semantic knowledge. We would like to
receive feedback on whether the task design seems
sound to the rest of the community, and whether sys-
tems which would perform well in such task could
be put to good use in real world applications.

Abstract
This paper presents Folheador, an online
service for browsing through Portuguese
semantic relations, acquired from differ-
ent sources. Besides facilitating the ex-
ploration of Portuguese lexical knowledge
bases, Folheador is connected to services
that access Portuguese corpora, which pro-
vide authentic examples of the semantic re-
lations in context.
1 Introduction
Lexical knowledge bases (LKBs) hold informa-
tion about the words of a language and their in-
teractions, according to their possible meanings.
They are typically structured on word senses,
which may be connected by means of semantic re-
lations. Besides important resources for language
studies, LKBs are key resources in the achieve-
ment of natural language processing tasks, such
as word sense disambiguation (see e.g. Agirre et
al. (2009)) or question answering (see e.g. Pasca
and Harabagiu (2001)).
Regarding the complexity of most knowledge
bases, their data formats are generally not suited
for being read by humans. User interfaces have
thus been developed for providing easier ways of
exploring the knowledge base and assessing its
contents. For instance, for LKBs, in addition to
information on words and semantic relations, it is
important that these interfaces provide usage ex-
amples where semantic relations hold, or at least
where related words co-occur.
In this paper, we present Folheador1, an on-
line browser for Portuguese LKBs. Besides an
1See http://www.linguateca.pt/Folheador/
interface for navigating through semantic rela-
tions acquired from different sources, Folheador
is linked to two services that provide access to
Portuguese corpora, thus allowing observation of
related words co-occurring in authentic contexts
of use, some of them even evaluated by humans.
After introducing several well-known LKBs
and their interfaces, we present Folheador and
its main features, also detailing the contents of
the knowledge base currently browseable through
this interface, which contains information ac-
quired from public domain lexical resources of
Portuguese. Then, before concluding, we discuss
additional features planned for the future.
2 Related Work
Here, we mention a few interfaces that ease the
exploration of well-known knowledge bases. Re-
garding the knowledge base structure, some of the
interfaces are significantly different.
Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is the
most widely used LKB to date. In addition to
other alternatives, the creators of WordNet pro-
vide online access to their resource through the
WordNet Search interface (Princeton University,
2010)2. As WordNet is structured around synsets
(groups of synonymous lexical items), querying
for a word prompts all synsets containing that
word to be presented. For each synset, its part-
of-speech (PoS), a gloss and a usage example are
provided. Synsets can also be expanded to access
the semantic relations they are involved in.
As a resource also organised in synsets, the

webwn
35
Brazilian Portuguese thesaurus TeP3 has a sim-
ilar interface (Maziero et al 2008). Neverthe-
less, since TeP does not contain relations besides
antonymy, its interface is simpler and provides
only the synsets containing a queried word and
their part-of-speech.
MindNet (Vanderwende et al 2005) is a LKB
extracted automatically, mainly from dictionar-
ies, and structured on semantic relations connect-
ing word senses to words. Its authors provide
MNEX4, an online interface for MindNet. After
querying for a pair of words, MNEX provides all
the semantic relation paths between them, estab-
lished by a set of links that connect directly or
indirectly one word to another. It is also possible
to view the definitions that originated the path.
FrameNet (Baker et al 1998) is a man-
ually built knowledge base structured on se-
mantic frames that describe objects, states or
events. There are several means for explor-
ing FrameNet easily, including FrameSQL (Sato,
2003)5, which allows searching for frames, lexi-
cal units and relations in an integrated interface,
and FrameGrapher6, a graphical interface for the
visualization of frame relations. For each frame,
in both interfaces, a textual definition, annotated
sentences of the frame elements, lists of the frame
relations, and lists with the lexical units in the
frame are provided.
ReVerb (Fader et al 2011) is a Web-scale
information extraction system that automatically
acquires binary relations from text. Using ReVerb
Search7, a web interface for ReVerb extractions, it
is possible to obtain sets of relational triples where
the predicate and/or the arguments contain given
strings. Regarding that each of the former is op-
tional, it is possible, for instance, to search for all
triples with the predicate loves and first argument
Portuguese. Search results include the matching
triples, organised according to the name of the
predicate, as well as the number of times each
triple was extracted. The sentences where each
triple was extracted from are as well provided.

Finally, Visual Thesaurus (Huiping et al
2006)8 is a proprietary graphical interface that
provides an alternative way of exploring a knowl-
edge base structured on word senses, synonymy,
antonymy and hypernymy relations. It presents a
graph centered on a queried word, connected to its
senses, as well as semantic relations between the
senses and other words. Nodes and edges have a
different color or look, respectively according to
the PoS of the sense or to the type of semantic re-
lation. If a word is clicked, a new graph, centered
on that word, is drawn.
3 Folheador
Folheador, in figure 2, is an online service for
browsing through instances of semantic relations,
represented as relational triples.
Folheador was originally designed as an inter-
face for PAPEL (Gonc?alo Oliveira et al 2010),
a public domain lexical-semantic network, auto-
matically extracted from a proprietary dictionary.
It was soon expanded to other (public) resources
for Portuguese as well (see Santos et al(2010) for
an overview of Portuguese LKBs).
The current version of Folheador browses
through a LKB that, besides PAPEL, in-
tegrates semantic triples from the following
sources: (i) synonymy acquired from two hand-
crafted thesauri of Portuguese9, TeP (Dias-Da-
Silva and de Moraes, 2003; da Silva et al
2002) and OpenThesaurus.PT10; (ii) relations ex-
tracted automatically in the scope of the project
Onto.PT (Gonc?alo Oliveira and Gomes, 2010;
Gonc?alo Oliveira et al 2011), which include
triples extracted from Wiktionary.PT11, and from
Diciona?rio Aberto (Simo?es and Farinha, 2011),
both public domain dictionaries.
Underlying relation triples in Folheador are
thus in the form x RELATED-TO y, where x and
y are lexical items and RELATED-TO is a predi-
cate. Their interpretation is as follows: one sense
of x is related to one sense of y, by means of a re-
lation whose type is identified by RELATED-TO.
8http://www.visualthesaurus.com/
9We converted the thesauri to triples x synonym-of y,
where x and y are lexical items in the same synset.

Figure 1: Folheador?s interface.
3.1 Navigation
It is possible to use Folheador for searching for
all relations with one, two, or no fixed arguments,
and one or no types (relation names). Combining
these options, Folheador can be used, for instance,
to obtain: all lexical items related to a particular
item; all relations between two lexical items; or a
sample of relations involving a particular type.
The matching triples are listed and may be
filtered according to the resource they were ex-
tracted from. For each triple, the PoS of the ar-
guments is shown, as well as a list with the iden-
tification of the resources from where it was ac-
quired. The arguments of each triple are also links
that make navigation easier. When clicked, Fol-
heador behaves the same way as if it had been
queried with the clicked word as argument. Also,
since the queried lexical item may occur in the
first or in the second argument of a triple, when
it occurs in the second, Folheador inverts the rela-
tion, so that the item appears always as the first ar-
gument. Therefore, there is no need to store both
the direct and the inverse triples.
Consider the example in figure 2: it shows
the triples retrieved after searching for the word
computador (computer, in English). In most of
the retrieved triples, computador is a noun (e.g.
computador HIPONIMO DE ma?quina), but there
are relations where it is an adjective (e.g. com-
putador PROPRIEDADE DO QUE computar).
Moreover, as hypernymy relations are stored in
the form x HIPERONIMO DE y, some of the
triples presented, such as computador HIPON-
IMO DE ma?quina and computador HIPON-
IMO DE aparelho, have been inverted on the fly.
Furthermore, for each triple, Folheador
presents: a confidence value based on the mere
co-occurrence of the words in corpora; and
another based on the co-occurrence of the related
words instantiating discriminating patterns of the
particular relation.
3.2 Graph visualization
Currently, Folheador contains a very simple visu-
alization tool, which draws the semantic relation
graph established by the search results in a page,
as in figure 3.2. In the future, we aim to provide an
alternative for navigation based on textual links,
which would be made through the graph.
3.3 The use of corpora
One of the problems of most lexical resources is
that they do not integrate or contain frequency in-
37
Figure 2: Graph for the results in figure 2.
formation. This is especially true when one is not
simply listing words but going deeper into mean-
ing, and listing semantic properties like word
senses or relationships between senses.
So, a list of relations among words can con-
flate a number of highly specialized and obsolete
words (or word senses) that co-occur with im-
portant and productive relations in everyday use,
which is not a good thing for human and auto-
matic users alike. On the other hand, using cor-
pora allows one to add frequency information to
both participants in the relation and the triples
themselves, and thus provide another axis to the
description of words.
In addition, it is always interesting to observe
language use in context, especially in cases where
the user is not sure whether the relation is cor-
rect or still in use (and the user can and should
be fairly suspicious when s/he is browsing auto-
matically compiled information). A corpus check
therefore provides illustration, and confirmation,
to a user facing an unusual or surprising relation,
in addition to evaluation data for the relation cu-
rator or lexicographer. If these checks have been
done before by a set of human beings (as is the
case of VARRA (Freitas et al forthcomming)),
one can have much more confidence on the data
browsed, something that is important for users.
Having this in mind, besides allowing to query
for stored relational triples, Folheador is con-
nected to AC/DC (Santos and Bick, 2000; San-
tos, 2011), an online service that provides ac-
cess to a large set of Portuguese corpora. In just
one click, it is possible to query for all the sen-
tences in the AC/DC corpora connecting the argu-
ments of a retrieved triple. Figure 3.3 shows some
of the results for the words computador (com-
puter) and aparelho (apparatus). While some of
the returned sentences might contain the related
words co-occurring almost by chance or without
a clear semantic relation, other sentences validate
the triple (e.g. sentence par=saude16727 in fig-
ure 3.3). Sometimes, the sentences might as well
invalidate the triple.
Furthermore, for some of the relation types, it
is possible to connect to another online service,
VARRA (Freitas et al forthcomming), which is
based on a set of patterns that express some of the
relation types, in corpora text. After clicking on
the VARRA link, this service is queried for occur-
rences of the corresponding triple in AC/DC. The
presented sentences (a subset of those returned
by the previous service) will thus contain the re-
lated words connected by a discriminating pat-
tern for the relation they hold. Figure 3.3 shows
two sentences returned for the relation computa-
dor HIPONIMO DE ma?quina.
These patterns, as those proposed by Hearst
(1992) and used in many projects since, may not
be 100% reliable. So, VARRA was designed to
allow human users to classify the sentences ac-
cording to whether the latter validate the relation,
are just compatible with it, or not even that.
In fact, people do not usually write defini-
tions, especially when using common sense terms
in ordinary discourse. Thus, co-occurrence of
semantically-related terms frequently indicates a
particular relation only implicitly. The choice
of assessing sentences as good validators of a
semantic relation is related to the task of auto-
matically finding good illustrative examples for
dictionaries, which is a surprisingly complex
task (Rychly? et al 2008).
This kind of information, amassed with the
help of VARRA, is much more difficult to cre-
ate, but is of great value to Folheador, since it
provides good illustrative contexts for the related
lexical items.
4 Further work and concluding remarks
We have shown that, as it is, Folheador is very
useful, as it enables to browse for triples with
fixed arguments, it identifies the source of the
triples, and, in one click, it provides real sentences
38
Figure 3: AC/DC: some sentences returned for the related words computador and aparelho.
Figure 4: VARRA: sentences that exemplify the relation computador hyponym-of ma?quina.
where related lexical items co-occur. Still, we are
planning to implement new basic features, such as
the suggestion of words, when the searched word
is not in the LKB. Also, while currently Folheador
only directly connects to AC/DC and VARRA, in
order to increase its usability, we plan to connect it
automatically to online definitions and other ser-
vices available on the Web. We intend as well to
crosslink Folheador from the AC/DC interface, in
the sense that one can invoke Folheador also by
just one click (Santos, forthcomming).
Currently, Folheador gives access to 169,385
lexical items: 93,612 nouns, 38,409 verbs, 33,497
adjectives and 3,867 adverbs, in a total of 722,589
triples, and it can browse through the following
types of semantic relations: synonymy, hyper-
nymy, part-of, member-of, causation, producer-
of, purpose-of, place-of, and property-of. How-
ever, as the underlying resources, especially the
ones created automatically, will continue to be up-
dated, one important challenge is to create a ser-
vice that does not get outdated, by accompany-
ing the progress of these resources, ideally doing
an automatic update every month. Furthermore,
we believe that quantitative studies on the com-
parison and the aggregation of the integrated re-
sources should be made, deeper than what is pre-
sented in Gonc?alo Oliveira et al(2011).
We would like to end by emphasizing that we
are aware that the proper interpretation of the
semantic relations may vary in the different re-
sources, even disregarding possible mistakes in
the automatic harvesting. It is enough to consider
the (regular morphological) relation between a
verb and an adjective/noun ended in -dor in Por-
tuguese (and which can be paraphrased by one
who Vs). For instance, in relations such as {sofrer
- sofredor}, {correr - corredor}, {roer - roedor},
the kind of verb defines the kind of temporal re-
lation conveyed: a rodent is essentially roendo,
while a sofredor (sufferer) suffers hopefully in a
particular situation and can stop suffering, and a
corredor (runner) runs as job or as role.
The source code of Folheador is open source12,
so it may be used by other authors to explore their
knowledge bases. Technical information about
Folheador may be found in Costa (2011).
