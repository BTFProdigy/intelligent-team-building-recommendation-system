Abstract
We present a pilot study of word-sense an-
notation using multiple annotators, relatively
polysemous words, and a heterogenous cor-
pus. Annotators selected senses for words in
context, using an annotation interface that pre-
sented WordNet senses. Interannotator agree-
ment (IA) results show that annotators agree
well or not, depending primarily on the indi-
vidual words and their general usage proper-
ties. Our focus is on identifying systematic
differences across words and annotators that
can account for IA variation. We identify three
lexical use factors: semantic specificity of the
context, sense concreteness, and similarity of
senses. We discuss systematic differences in
sense selection across annotators, and present
the use of association rules to mine the data
for systematic differences across annotators.
1 Introduction
Our goal is to grapple seriously with the natural
sense variation arising from individual differences in
word usage. It has been widely observed that usage
features such as vocabulary and syntax vary across
corpora of different genres and registers (Biber,
1995), and that serve different functions (Kittredge
et al, 1991). Still, we are far from able to pre-
dict specific morphosyntactic and lexical variations
across corpora (Kilgarriff, 2001), much less quan-
tify them in a way that makes it possible to apply
the same analysis tools (taggers, parsers) without re-
training. In comparison to morphosyntactic proper-
ties of language, word and phrasal meaning is fluid,
and to some degree, generative (Pustejovsky, 1991;
Nunberg, 1979). Based on our initial observations
from a word sense annotation task for relatively pol-
ysemous words, carried out by multiple annotators
on a heterogeneous corpus, we hypothesize that dif-
ferent words lead to greater or lesser interannota-
tor agreement (IA) for reasons that in the long run
should be explicitly modelled in order for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) applications to handle
usage differences more robustly. This pilot study is
a step in that direction.
We present related work in the next section, then
describe the annotation task in the following one. In
Section 4, we present examples of variation in agree-
ment on a matched subset of words. In Section 5
we discuss why we believe the observed variation
depends on the words and present three lexical use
factors we hypothesize to lead to greater or lesser
IA. In Section 6, we use association rules to mine
our data for systematic differences among annota-
tors, thus to explain the variations in IA. We con-
clude with a summary of our findings goals.
2 Related Work
There has been a decade-long community-wide ef-
fort to evaluate word sense disambiguation (WSD)
systems across languages in the four Senseval ef-
forts (1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007, cf. (Kilgarriff,
1998; Pedersen, 2002a; Pedersen, 2002b; Palmer
et al, 2005)), with a corollary effort to investi-
gate the issues pertaining to preparation of man-
ually annotated gold standard corpora tagged for
word senses (Palmer et al, 2005). Differences in IA
and system performance across part-of-speech have
been examined, as in (Ng et al, 1999; Palmer et al,

Table 1: Ten Words

tion across individual words in evaluating WSD sys-
tems, but does not attempt to explain it.
Factors that have been proposed as affecting
human or system sense disambiguation include
whether annotators are allowed to assign multilabels
(Veronis, 1998; Ide et al, 2002; Passonneau et al,
2006), the number or granularity of senses (Ng et al,
1999), merging of related senses (Snow et al, 2007),
sense similarity (Chugur et al, 2002), sense perplex-
ity (Diab, 2004), entropy (Diab, 2004; Palmer et
al., 2005), and in psycholinguistic experiments, re-
actions times required to distinguish senses (Klein
and Murphy, 2002; Ide and Wilks, 2006).
With respect to using multiple annotators, Snow
et al included disambiguation of the word
president?a relatively non-polysemous word with
three senses?in a set of tasks given to Amazon Me-
chanical Turkers, aimed at determining how to com-
bine data from multiple non-experts for machine
learning tasks. The word sense task comprised 177
sentences taken from the SemEval Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation Lexical Sample task. Majority voting
among three annotators achieve 99% accuracy.
3 The Annotation Task
The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)
project is creating a small, representative corpus
of American English written and spoken texts
drawn from the Open American National Cor-
pus (OANC).1 The MASC corpus includes hand-
validated or manually produced annotations for a va-
riety of linguistic phenomena. One of the goals of
1http://www.anc.org
Figure 1: MASC word sense annotation tool
the project is to support efforts to harmonize Word-
Net (Miller et al, 1993) and FrameNet (Ruppen-
hofer et al, 2006), in order to bring the sense distinc-
tions each makes into better alignment. As a start-
ing sample, we chose ten fairly frequent, moderately
polysemous words for sense tagging, targeting in
particular words that do not yet exist in FrameNet, as
well as words with different numbers of senses in the
two resources. The ten words with part of speech,
number of senses, and occurrences in the OANC
are shown in Table 1. One thousand occurrences
of each word , including all occurrences appear-
ing in the MASC subset and others semi-randomly2
chosen from the remainder of the 15 million word
OANC, were annotated by at least one annotator of
six undergraduate annotators at Vassar College and
Columbia University.
Fifty occurrences of each word in context were
sense-tagged by all six annotators for the in-depth
study of inter-annotator agreement (IA) reported
here. We have just finished collecting annotations
of fifty new occurrences. All annotations are pro-

shown in Figure 1: the sentence context is at the top
with the word in boldface (fair), a comment region
below that allows the annotator to keep notes, and
a scrollable area below that shows three of the ten
WordNet senses for ?fair.?
4 Observation: Varying Agreement,
depending on Lexical Items
We expected to find varying levels of interannotator
agreement (IA) among all six annotators, depend-
ing on obvious grouping factors such as the part of
speech, or the number of senses per word. We do
find widely varying levels of agreement, but as de-
scribed here, most of the variation does not depend
on these a priori factors. Inherent usage properties
of the words themselves, and systematic patterns of
variation across annotators, seem to be the primary
factors, with a secondary effect of part of speech.
In previous work (Passonneau, 2004), we have
discussed why we use Krippendorff?s ? (Krippen-
dorff, 1980), and for purposes of comparison we
also report Cohen?s ?; note the similarity in values3.
As with the various agreement coefficients that fac-
tor out the agreement that would occur by chance,
values range from 1 for perfect agreement and -1
for perfect opposition, to 0 for chance agreement.
While there are no hard and fast criteria for what
constitutes good IA, Landis and Koch (Landis and
Koch, 1977) consider values between 0.40 and 0.60
to represent moderately good agreement, and values
above 0.60 as quite good; Krippendorff (Krippen-
dorff, 1980) considers values above 0.67 moderately
good, and values above 0.80 as quite good. (cf. (Art-
stein and Poesio, 2008) for discussion of agreement
measurement for computational linguistic tasks.)
Table 2 shows IA for a pair of adjectives, nouns
and verbs from our sample for which the IA scores
are at the extremes (high and low) in each pair: the
average delta is 0.24. Note that the agreement de-
creases as part-of-speech varies from adjectives to
nouns to verbs, but for all three parts-of-speech,
there is a wide spread of values. It is striking, given
that the same annotators did all words, that one in
each pair has relatively better agreement.

and Poesio, 2008) propose an extension of ? (?3) we use here.

land 0.2627 0.2671 11 8
verb tell 0.4152 0.4165 8 8
show 0.2636 0.2696 12 11
Table 2: Varying interannotator agreement across words
The average of the agreement values shown in
Table 2 (?=0.4164; ?=0.4191) is somewhat higher
than the average 0.317 found for 191 words anno-
tated for WordNet senses in (Ng et al, 1999), but
lower than their recomputed ? of 0.85 for verbs, af-
ter they reanalyzed the data to merge senses for 42
of the verbs. It is widely recognized that achieving
high ? scores (or percent agreement between anno-
tators, cf. (Palmer et al, 2005)) is difficult for word
sense annotation.
Given that the same annotators have higher IA on
some words, and lower on others, we hypothesize
that it is the word usages themselves that lead to the
high deltas in IA for each part-of-speech pair. We
discuss the impact of three factors on the observed
variations in agreement:
1. Greater specificity in the contexts of use leads to
higher agreement
2. More concrete senses give rise to higher agreement
3. A sense inventory with closely related senses
(e.g., relatively lower average inter-sense similarity
scores) gives rise to lower agreement
5 Explanatory Factors
First we list factors that can not explain the variation
in Table 2. Then we turn to examples illustrating
factors that can, based on a manual search for exam-
ples of two types: examples where most annotators
agreed on a single sense, and examples where two
or three senses were agreed upon by multiple anno-
tators. Later we how how we use association rules
to detect these two types of cases automatically. For
these examples, the WordNet sense number is shown
(e.g., WN S1) with an abbreviated gloss, followed
by the number of annotators who chose it.
4
5.1 Ruled Out Factors
It appears that neither annotator expertise, a word?s
part of speech, the number of senses in WordNet,
the number of senses annotators find in the corpus,
nor the nature of the distribution across senses, can
account for the variation in IA in Table 2. All six
annotators used the same annotation tool, the same
guidelines, and had already become experienced in
the word sense annotation task.
The six annotators all exhibit roughly the same
performance. We measure an individual annotator?s
performance by computing the average pairwise IA
(IA2). For every annotator Ai, we first compute the
pairwise agreement of Ai with every other annota-
tor, then average. This gives us a measure for com-
paring individual annotators with each other: an-
notators that have a higher IA2 have more agree-
ment, on average, with other annotators. Note that
we get the same ranking of individuals when for
each annotator, we calculate how much the agree-
ment among the five remaining annotators improves
over the agreement among all six annotators. If
agreement improves relatively more when annota-
tor Ai is dropped, then Ai agrees less well with the
other five annotators. While both approaches give
the same ranking among annotators, IA2 also pro-
vides a number that has an interpretable value.
On a word-by-word basis, some annotators do
better than others. For example, for long, the best
annotator (A) has IA2=0.79, and the worst (F) has
0.44. However, across ten words annotated by all
six, the average of their IA2 is 0.39 with a standard
deviation of 0.037. F at 0.32 is an outlier; apart from
F, annotators have similar IA across words.
Table 2 lists the distribution of available senses
in WordNet for the four words (column 4), and the
number of senses used (column 5). The words work
and tell have relatively fewer senses (seven and eig-
ith) compared with nine through twelve for the other
words. However, neither the number (or proportion)
of senses used by annotators, nor the distribution
across senses, has a significant correlation with IA,
as given by Pearson?s correlation test.
5.2 Lexical Use Factors
Underspecified contexts lead to ambiguous word
meanings, a factor that has been recognized as be-
ing associated with polysemous contexts (Palmer et
al., 2005). We find that the converse is also true:
relatively specific contexts reduce ambiguity.
The word long seems to engender the greatest IA
primarily because the contexts are concrete and spe-
cific, with a secondary effect that adjectives have
higher IA overall than the other parts of speech. Sen-
tences such as (1.), where a specific unit of temporal
or spatial measurement is mentioned (months), re-
strict the sense to extent in space or time.
1. For 18 long months Michael could not find a job.
WN S1. temporal extent [N=6 of 6]
In the few cases where annotators disagree on
long, the context is less specific or less concrete. In
example (2.), long is predicated of the word chap-
ter, which has non-concrete senses that exemplify
a certain type of productive polysemy (Pustejovsky,
1991). It can be taken to refer to a physical object
(a specific set of pages in an actual book), or a con-
ceptual object (the abstract literary work). The ad-
jective inherits this polysemy. The three annotators
who agree on sense two (spatial extent) might have
the physical object sense in mind; the two who select
sense one (temporal extent) possibly took the point
of view of the reader who requires a long time to
read the chapter.

Simon Schuster had suggested a number of cuts to
streamline what was already a long and involved
chapter on Brians ideas.

WN S1.temporal extent [N=2 of 6],

Several of the senses of work are concrete, and
quite distinct: sense seven, ?an artist?s or writer?s
output?; sense three, ?the occupation you are paid
for?; sense five, ?unit of force in physics?; sense
six, ?the place where one works.? These are the
senses most often selected by a majority of annota-
tors. Senses one and two, which are closely related,
are the two senses most often selected by different
annotators for the same instance. They also repre-
sent examples of productive polysemy, here between
an activity sense (sense one) and a product-of-the-
activity sense (sense two). Example (3) shows a sen-
5
tence where the verb perform restricts the meaning
to the activity sense, which all annotators selected.

suggests that cell protrusions are a general mech-
anism for cell-to-cell communication and that in-

dently of exo- and endocytosis.
WN S1.activity of making something [N=6 of 6]
In sentence (4.), four annotators selected sense
one (activity) and two selected sense two (result):
4. A close friend is a plastic surgeon who did some
minor OK semi-major facial work on me in the past.
WN S1.activity directed toward making something
[N=4 of 6],
WN S2.product of the effort of a person or thing
[N=2 of 6]
For the word fair, if five or six annotators agree,
often they have selected sense one??free of fa-
voritism or bias??as in example (5). However, this
sense is often selected along with sense two??not ex-
cessive or extreme?as in example (6). Both senses
are relatively abstract.
5. By insisting that everything Microsoft has done is
fair competition they risk the possibility that the
public if it accepts the judges finding to the con-
trary will conclude that Microsoft doesn?t know the
difference.

punishment.

WN S2.not excessive or extreme [N=3 of 6]
Example (7) illustrates a case where all annota-
tors agreed on a sense for land. The named entity
India restricts the meaning to sense five, ?territory
occupied by a nation.? Apart from a few such cases
of high consensus, land seems to have low agree-
ment due to senses being so closely related they can
be merged. Senses one and seven both have to do
with property (cf. example (8))., senses three and
five with geopolitical senses, and senses two and
four with the earth?s surface or soil. If these three
pairs of senses are merged into three senses, the IA
goes up from 0.2627 to 0.3677.
7. India is exhilarating exhausting and infuriating a
land where you?ll find the practicalities of daily life
overlay the mysteries that popular myth attaches to

WN S4.solid part of the earth?s surface [N=1 of 6],
WN S1.location of real estate [N=2 of 6],
WN S7.extensive landed property [N=3 of 6]
Examples for tell and show exhibit the same trend
in which agreement is greater when the sense is
more specific or concrete, which we illustrate briefly
with show. Example (9) describes a specific work of
art, an El Greco painting, and agreement is universal
among the six annotators on sense 5. In contrast, ex-
ample (10) shows a fifty-fifty split among annotators
for a sentence with a very specific context, an ex-
periment regarding delivery of a DNA solution, but
where the sense is abstract rather than concrete: the
argument of show is an abstract proposition, namely
a conclusion is drawn regarding what the experiment
demonstrates, rather than a concrete result such as a
specific measurement, or statistical outcome. Sense
two in fact contains the word ?experiment? that oc-
curs in (9), which presumably biases the choice of
sense two. Impressionistically, senses two and three
appear to be quite similar.

5.3 Quantifying Sense Similarity
Application of an inter-sense similarity measure
(ISM) proposed in (Ide, 2006) to the sense invento-
ries for each of the six words supports the observa-
tion that words with very similar senses have lower
IA scores. ISM is computed for each pair in a given
word?s sense inventory, using a variant of the lesk
measure (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002). Agglom-
erative clustering may then be applied to the result-
ing similarity matrix to reveal the overall pattern of
inter-sense relations.
ISMs for senses pairs of long, fair, work, land,
tell, and show range from 0 to 1.44.4 We compute
a confusion threshhold CT based on the ISMs for all
250 sense pairs as
CT = ?A + 2?A
where A is the sum of the ISMs for the six words? 250
sense pairs.
Table 3 shows the ISM statistics for the six words. The
values show that the ISMs for work and long are signifi-
cantly lower than for land and fair. The ISMs for the two
verbs in the study, show and tell, are distributed across
nearly the same range (0 - 1.38 and 0 - 1.22, respec-
tively), despite substantially lower IA scores for show.
However, the ISMs for three of show?s sense pairs are
well above CT , vs. one for tell, suggesting that in addi-
tion to the range of ISMs for a given word?s senses, the
number of sense pairs with high similarity contributes to
low IA. Overall, the correlation between the percentage
of ISMs above CT for the words in this study and their
IA scores is .8, which supports this claim.

6 Association Rules
Association rules express relations among instances
based on their attributes. Here the attributes of interest are
4Note that because the scores are based on overlaps among
WordNet relations, glosses, examples, etc., there is no pre-
defined ceiling value for the ISMs. For the words in this study,
we compute a ceiling value by taking the maximum of the ISMs
for each of the 57 senses with itself, 4.85 in this case.
the annotators who choose one sense versus those who
choose another. Mining association rules to find strong
relations has been studied in many domains (see for in-
stance (Agrawal et al, 1993; Zaki et al, 1997; Salleb-
Aouissi et al, 2007)). Here we illustrate how association
rules can be used to mine relations such as systematic dif-
ferences in word sense choices across annotators.
An association rule is an expression C1 ? C2, where
C1 and C2 express conditions on features describing the
instances in a dataset. The strength of the rules is usually
evaluated by means of measures such as Support (Supp)
and Confidence (Conf). Where C, C1 and C2 express con-
ditions on attributes:
? Supp(C) is the fraction of instances satisfying C
? Supp(C1 ? C2) = Supp(C1 ? C2)
? Conf(C1 ? C2) = Supp(C1 ? C2)/Supp(C1)
Given two thresholds MinSupp (for minimum support)
and MinConf (for minimum confidence), a rule is strong
when its support is greater than MinSupp and its confi-
dence greater than MinConf. Discovering strong rules is
usually a two-step process of retrieving instances above
MinSupp, then from these retrieving instances above
MinConf.
The types of association rules to mine can include
any attributes in either the left hand side or the right
hand side of rules. In our data, the attributes consist
of the word sense assigned by annotators, the annota-
tors, and the instances (words). In order to find rules
that relate annotators to each other, the dataset must be
pre-processed to produce flat (two-dimensional) tables.
Here we focus on annotators to get a flat table in which
each line corresponds to an annotator/sense combination:
Annotator Sense. We denote the six annotators as A1
through A6, and word senses by WordNet sense number.
Here are 15 unique pairs of annotators, so one way
to look at where agreements occur is to determine how
many of these pairs choose the same sense with non-
negligible support and confidence. Tell has much bet-
ter IA than show, but less than long and work. We
would expect association rules among many pairs of
annotators for some but not all of its senses. We
find 11 pairs of rules of the form Ai Tell:Sense1 ?
Aj Tell:Sense1, Aj Tell:Sense1 ? Ai Tell:Sense1,
indicating a bi-directional relationship between pairs of
annotators choosing the same sense, with support rang-
ing from 14% to 44% and confidence ranging from 37%
to 96%. This indicates good support and confidence for
many possible pairs
Our interest here is primarily in mining for systematic
disagreements thus we now turn to pairs of rules where
in one rule, an attribute Annotator Sensei occurs in the
left hand side, and a distinct attributeAnnotator Sensej
occurs in the right. Again, we are especially interested in

Table 4: Association Rules for Systematic Disagreements
bi-directional cases where there is a corresponding rule
with the left and right hand clauses reversed. Table 4
shows some general classes of disagreement rules using a
compact representation with a bidirectional arrow, along
with a table of variables for the different pairs of annota-
tors associated with different levels of support and confi-
dence.
For fair, Table 4 summarizes three pairs of rules with
good support (16-20% of all instances) in which one an-
notator chooses sense 1 of fair and another chooses sense
2: A3 and A5 choose sense 1 where A6 chooses sense 2,
and A1 chooses sense 1 where A2 chooses sense 2. The
confidence varies for each rule, thus in 100% of cases
where A6 selects sense 2 of fair, A3 selects sense 1, but
in only 32.3% of cases is the converse true. Example (6)
where half the annotators picked sense 1 of fair and half
picked sense 2 falls into the set of instances covered by
these rules. The rules indicate this is not isolated, but
rather part of a systematic pattern of usage.
The word land had the lowest interannotator agree-
ment among the six annotators, with eight of eleven
senses were used overall (cf. Table 2). Here we did not
find pairs of rules in which distinct Annotator Sense
attributes that occur in the left and right sides of one rule
occur in the right and left sides of another rule. For show,
Table 4 illustrates two systematic divisions among
groups of annotators. With rather good support rang-
ing from 12% to 32%, senses 2 and 3 exhibit a system-
atic difference: annotators A1, A4 and A5 select sense
2 where annotators A3, A3 and A6 select sense 3. Sim-
ilarly, senses 5 and 10 exhibit a systematic difference:
with a more modest support of 8% to 12%, annotators
A1, A3, A4 and A5 select sense 5 where annotators A2
and A6 select sense 10.
7 Conclusion
We have performed a sense assignment experiment
among multiple annotators for word occurrences drawn
from a broad range of genres, rather than the domain-
specific data utilized in many studies. The selected words
were all moderately polysemous. Based on the results,
we identify several factors that distinguish words with
high vs. low interannotator agreement scores. We also
show the use of association rules to mine the data for
systematic annotator differences. Where relevant, the re-
sults can be used to merge senses, as done in much pre-
vious work, or to identify internal structure within a set
of senses, such as a word-based sense-hierarchy. In our
future work, we want to develop the use of association
rules in several ways. First, we hope to fully automated
the process of finding systematic patterns of difference
across annotators. Second, we hope to extend their use
to mining associations among the representations of in-
stances in order to further investigate the lexical use fac-
tors discussed here.

Abstract
Manual annotation of natural language to
capture linguistic information is essen-
tial for NLP tasks involving supervised
machine learning of semantic knowledge.
Judgements of meaning can be more or
less subjective, in which case instead of
a single correct label, the labels assigned
might vary among annotators based on the
annotators? knowledge, age, gender, intu-
itions, background, and so on. We intro-
duce a framework ?Anveshan,? where we
investigate annotator behavior to find out-
liers, cluster annotators by behavior, and
identify confusable labels. We also in-
vestigate the effectiveness of using trained
annotators versus a larger number of un-
trained annotators on a word sense annota-
tion task. The annotation data comes from
a word sense disambiguation task for pol-
ysemous words, annotated by both trained
annotators and untrained annotators from
Amazon?s Mechanical turk. Our results
show that Anveshan is effective in uncov-
ering patterns in annotator behavior, and
we also show that trained annotators are
superior to a larger number of untrained
annotators for this task.

2 Introduction
Manual annotation of language data in order to
capture linguistic knowledge has become increas-
ingly important for semantic and pragmatic an-
notation tasks. A very short list of a few such
tasks illustrates the range of types of annotation,
in varying stages of development: predicate ar-
gument structure (Palmer et al, 2005b), dialogue
acts (Hu et al, 2009), discourse structure (Carbone
et al, 2004), opinion (Wiebe and Cardie, 2005),
emotion (Alm et al, 2005). The number of ef-
forts to create corpus resources that include man-
ual annotations has also been growing. A common
approach in assessing the resulting manual anno-
tations is to report a single quantitative measure
reflecting the quality of the annotations, either a
summary statistic such as percent agreement, or
an agreement coefficient from the family of met-
rics that include Krippendorff?s alpha (Krippen-
dorff, 1980) and Cohen?s kappa (Cohen, 1960).
We present some new assessment methods to use
in combination with an agreement coefficient for
understanding annotator behavior when there are
multiple annotators and many annotation values.
Anveshan (Annotation Variance Estimation)1 is
a suite of procedures for analyzing patterns of
agreement and disagreement among annotators,
as well as the distributions of annotation values
across annotators. Anveshan thus makes it pos-
sible to explore annotator behavior in more detail.
Currently, it includes three types of analysis: inter-
annotator agreement (IA) among all subsets of an-
notators, leverage of annotation values for outlier
detection, and metrics for comparing annotators?
distributions of annotation values (e.g., Kullbach-
Liebler divergence).
As an illustration of the utility of Anveshan, we
compare two groups of annotators on the same an-
notation word sense annotation tasks: a half dozen
trained annotators and fourteen Mechanical Turk-
ers. Previous work has argued that it can be cost
effective to collect multiple labels from untrained
labelers at a low cost per label, and to combine
the multiple labels through a voting method, rather
than to collect single labels from highly trained la-
1Anveshan is a Sanskrit word which literally means
search or exploration.
47
belers (Snow et al, 2008; Sheng et al, 2008; Lam
and Stork, 2003). The tasks included in (Snow et
al., 2008), for example, include word sense an-
notation; in contrast to our case, where the av-
erage number of senses per word is 9.5, the one
word sense annotation task had three senses. We
find that the same half dozen trained annotators
can agree well or not on sense labels for poly-
semous words. When they agree less well, we
find that it is possible to distinguish between prob-
lems in the labels (e.g., confusable senses) and
systematic differences of interpretation among an-
notators. When we use twice the number of Me-
chanical Turkers as trained annotators for three of
our ten polysemous words, we find inconsistent re-
sults.
The next section of the paper presents the moti-
vation for Anveshan and its relevance to the word
sense annotation task, followed by a section on
related work. The word sense annotation data is
given in section 5. Anveshan is described in the
subsequent section, followed by the results of its
application to the two data sets. We discuss the
comparison of trained annotators and Mechanical
Turkers, as well as differences among words, in
section 7. Section 7 concludes with a short recap
of Anveshan in general, and its application to word
sense annotations in particular.
3 Beyond Interannotator Agreement (IA)
Assessing the reliability of an annotation typically
addresses the question of whether different anno-
tators (effectively) assign the same annotation la-
bels. Various measures can be used to compare
different annotators, including agreement coeffi-
cients such as Krippendorff?s alpha (Krippendorff,
1980). Extensive reviews of the properties of such
coefficients have been presented elsewhere, e.g.,
(Artstein and Poesio, 2008). Briefly, an agree-
ment produce values in the interval [-1,1] indicat-
ing how much of the observed agreement is above
(or below) agreement that would be predicted by
chance (value of 0). To measure reliability in this
way is to assume that for most of the instances in
the data, there is a single correct response. Here
we present the use of reliability metrics and other
measures for word sense annotation, and we as-
sume that in some cases there may not be a single
correct response. When annotators have less than
excellent agreement, we aim to examine possible
causes.
We take word sense to be a problematic anno-
tation to perform, thus requiring a deeper under-
standing of the conditions under which annotators
might disagree. The many reasons can only be
touched on here. For example, word senses are
not discrete, atomic units that can be delimited and
enumerated. While dictionaries and other lexical
resoures, such as WordNet (Miller et al, 1993) or
the Hector lexicon (cf. SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff
and Palmer, 2000)), do provide enumerations of
the senses for a given word, and their interrela-
tions (e.g., a list of senses, a tree of senses), it is
widely agreed that this is a convenient abstraction,
if for no other reason than the fact that words shift
meanings along with the communicative needs of
the groups of individuals who use them. The con-
text in which a word is used plays a significant role
in restricting the current sense. As a result, it is
often argued that the best representation for word
meaning would consist in clustering the contexts
in which words are used (Kilgarriff, 1997). Yet
even this would be insufficient because new com-
munities arise, new behaviors and artifacts emerge
along with them, hence new contexts of use and
new clusters. At the same time, contexts of use
and the senses that go along with them can fade
away (cf. the use of handbag discussed in (Kilgar-
riff, 1997) pertaining to disco dancing). Because
an enumeration of word senses is somewhat arti-
ficial, annotators might disagree on word senses
because they disagree on the boundaries between
one sense and another, just as professional lexi-
cographers do.
Apart from the artificiality of creating flat or
hierarchical sense inventories, the meanings of
words can vary in their subjectivity, due to differ-
ences in the perception or experience of individu-
als. This can be true for word senses that are inher-
ently relative, such as cold (as in, turn up the ther-
mostat, it?s too cold in here); or that derive their
meaning from cultural norms that may differ from
community to community, such as justice; or that
change as one grows older, e.g., whether a long
time to wait pertains to hours versus days.
Despite the arguments against using word sense
inventories, until they are replaced with an equally
convenient and more representative abstraction,
they are an extremely convenient computational
representation. We rely on WordNet senses, which
are presented to annotators with a gloss (defini-
tion) and with example uses. In order to better un-
48
derstand reasons for disagreement on senses, we
collect labels from multiple annotators. When an-
notators agree, having multiple annotators is re-
dundant. But when annotators disagree, having
multiple annotators is necessary in order to de-
termine whether the disagreement is due to noise
based on insufficiently clear sense definitions ver-
sus a systematic difference between individuals,
e.g., those who see a glass as half empty where
others see it as half full. To insure the opportu-
nity to observe how varied the labeling of a single
word can be, we collect word sense annotations
from multiple annotators. One potential benefit of
such investigation might be a better understanding
of how to model word meaning.
In sum, we hypothesize the following cases:
? Outliers: A small proportion of annotators
may assign senses in a manner that differs
markedly from the remaining annotators.
? Confusability of senses: If multiple annota-
tors assign multiple senses in an apparently
random fashion, it may be that the senses are
not sufficiently distinct.
? Systematic differences among subsets of an-
notators: If the same 50% of annotators al-
ways pick sense X where the remaining an-
notators always pick sense Y, it may be that
properties of the annotators, such as their age
cohort, account for the disagreement.
4 Related Work
There has been a decade-long community-wide ef-
fort to evaluate word sense disambiguation (WSD)
systems across languages in the four Senseval ef-
forts (1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007, cf. (Kilgarriff,
1998; Pedersen, 2002a; Pedersen, 2002b; Palmer
et al, 2005a)), with a corollary effort to investi-
gate the issues pertaining to preparation of man-
ually annotated gold standard corpora tagged for
word senses (Palmer et al, 2005a).
Differences in IA and system performance
across part-of-speech have been examined, as
in (Ng et al, 1999; Palmer et al, 2005a). Fac-
tors that have been proposed as affecting agree-
ment include whether annotators are allowed to as-
sign multilabels (Ve?ronis, 1998; Ide et al, 2002;
Passonneau et al, 2006), the number or granu-
larity of senses (Ng et al, 1999), merging of re-
lated senses (Snow et al, 2007), sense similar-
ity (Chugur et al, 2002), entropy (Diab, 2004;
Palmer et al, 2005a), and reactions times required
to distinguish senses (Klein and Murphy, 2002;
Ide and Wilks, 2006).
We anticipate that one of the ways in which the
data will be used will be to train machine learning
approaches to WSD. Noise in labeling and the im-
pact on machine learning has been discussed from
various perspectives. In (Reidsma and Carletta,
2008), it is argued that machine learning perfor-
mance does not vary consistently with interannota-
tor agreement. Through a simulation study, the au-
thors find that machine learning performance can
degrade or not with lower agreement, depending
on whether the disagreement is due to noise or sys-
tematic behavior. Noise has relatively little impact
compared with systematic disagreements. In (Pas-
sonneau et al, 2008), a similar lack of correla-
tion between interannotator agreement and ma-
chine learning performance is found in an empiri-
cal investigation.
5 Word Sense Annotation Data
5.1 Trained Annotator data
The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)
project (Ide et al, 2010) is creating a small,
representative corpus of American English written
and spoken texts drawn from the Open American
National Corpus (OANC).2 The MASC corpus
includes hand-validated or manual annotations
for a variety of linguistic phenomena. The first
MASC release, available as of May 2010, consists
of 82K words.3 One of the goals of MASC is
to support efforts to harmonize WordNet (Miller
et al, 1993) and FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al,
2006), in order to bring the sense distinctions each
makes into better alignment.
We chose ten fairly frequent, moderately poly-
semous words for sense tagging. One hundred oc-
currences of each word were sense annotated by
five or six trained annotators. The ten words are
shown in Table 1, the words are grouped by part of
speech, with the number of WordNet senses, the
number of senses used by the trained annotators
(TAs), the number of annotators, and Alpha. We
call this the Trained annotator (TA) data.
We find that interannotator agreement (IA)
among half a dozen annotators varies depending
on the word. For ten words nearly balanced with

Table 1: Interannotator agreement on ten poly-
semous words: three adjectives, three nouns and
four verbs among trained annotators
respect to part of speech, we find a range of about
0.50 to 0.70 for nouns and adjectives, and about
0.37 to 0.46 for verbs. Table 1 shows the ten words
and the alpha scores for the same five or six an-
notators. The layout of the table illustrates both
that verbs have lower agreement than adjectives
or nouns, and that within each part of speech, an-
notators achieve varying levels of agreement, de-
pending on the word. The annotators, their level
of training, the number of sense choices, the anno-
tation tool, and other factors remain constant from
word to word. Thus we hypothesize that the differ-
ences in IA reflect differences in the degree of sub-
jectivity of the sense choices, the sense similarity,
or both. Anveshan is a data exploration framework
to help understand the differences in the ability of
the same annotators to agree well on sense anno-
tation for some words and not others.
As shown, annotators achieve respectable
agreement on long, time and work, and lower
agreement on the remaining words. Verbs have
lower agreement overall.

Table 2: Interannotator agreement on adjectives
among Mechanical Turk annotators
(HITs) such as sense annotation for words in a
sentence, can be set up and results from a large
number of annotators (or turkers) can be obtained
quickly. We used Mechanical Turk to obtain anno-
tations from 14 annotators on the set of adjectives
to analyze IA for a larger set of untrained annota-
tors.
The task was set up to get 150 occurrences an-
notated for each of the three adjectives: fair, long
and quiet, by 14 mechanical turk annotators each.
100 of these occurrences were the same as those
done by the trained annotators. For each word,
the 150 instances were divided into 15 HITs of 10
instances each. The average submit time of a HIT
was 200 seconds. We report the IA among the Me-
chanical Turk annotators using Krippendorff?s Al-
pha in Table 2. As shown, the turkers have poor
agreement, particularly on long and quiet, which
is at the chance level.
6 Anveshan
Anveshan: Annotation Variance Estimation, is
our approach to perform a more subtle analysis
of inter-annotator agreement. Anveshan uses sim-
ple statistical methods to achieve the three goals
identified in section 3: outlier detection, confus-
able senses, and distinct subsets of annotators that
agree with each other.
6.1 Method
This section uses the following notation to explain
Anveshan?s methodology:
We assume that we have n annotators annotat-
ingm senses. The probability of annotator a using
sense si is given by
Pa(S = si) =
count(si, a)
?m
j=1 count(sj , a)
where, count(si, a) is number of times si was
used by a.

1 primarily temporal sense; being or indicating a relatively great or greater than average duration or passage of time
or a duration as specified: ?a long life?; ?a long boring speech?; ?a long time?; ?a long friendship?;
?a long game?; ?long ago?; ?an hour long?
2 primarily spatial sense; of relatively great or greater than average spatial extension or extension as specified:
?a long road?; ?a long distance?; ?contained many long words?; ?ten miles long?
3 of relatively great height: ?a race of long gaunt men? (Sherwood Anderson); ?looked out the long French windows?
Figure 1: Three of the WordNet senses for ?Long?
Anveshan uses the Kullbach-Liebler divergence
(KLD), Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and
Leverage to compare probability distributions.
The KLD of two probability distributions P and
Q is given by:
KLD(P,Q) =
?
i
P (i) log
P (i)
Q(i)
JSD is a modified version of KLD, it is also
known as total divergence to the average, and is
given by:
JSD(P,Q) =
1
2
KLD(P,M) +
1
2
KLD(Q,M)
where
M = (P + Q)/2
We define Leverage Lev of probability distribu-
tion P over Q as:
Lev(P,Q) =
?
k
|P (k) ?Q(k)|
We now compute the following statistics:
? For each annotator ai, we compute Pai .
? We compute Pavg, which is (
?
i Pai)/n.
? We compute Lev(Pai , Pavg),?i
? Then we compute JSD(Pai , Paj ) ?(i, j),
where i, j ? n and i 6= j
? Lastly, we compute a distance measure for
each annotator, by computing the KLD be-
tween each annotator and the average of
the remaining annotators, i.e. we get
?i,Dai = KLD(Pai , Q), where Q =
(
?
j 6=i Paj )/(n? 1)
These statistics give us a deeper understanding
of annotator behavior. Looking at the sense us-
age probabilities, we can identify how frequently
senses are used by an annotator. We can see how
much an annotator deviates from the average sense

usage distribution by looking at Leverage. JSD be-
tween two annotators gives us a measure of how
close they are to each other. KLD of an annota-
tor with the remaining annotators shows us how
different the annotator is from the rest. In the fol-
lowing section we show results, which illustrate
the effectiveness of Anveshan in identifying use-
ful patterns in the data from the trained annotators
(TAs) and Mechanical Turkers (MTs).
6.2 Results
We used Anveshan on all data from TAs and MTs.
We were successful in correctly identifying out-
liers on many words. Also, analyzing the sense
usage patterns and observing the JSD and KLD
scores gave us useful insights on annotator differ-
ences. In the figures for this section, the six TAs
are represented by their unique identifiers (A101,
A102, A103, A105, A107, A108). Word senses
are identified by adding 100 to the WordNet sense

number. An additional ?None of the Above? label
is represented as 999; annotators select this when
no sense applies, when the word occurs as part of
a large lexical unit (collocation) with a clearly dis-
tinct meaning, or when the sentence is not a cor-
rect example for other reasons (e.g., wrong part of
speech).
Figure 2 shows the distance measure (KLD) for
each annotator from the rest of the annotators for
the word long with respect to the probability for
each of the four senses used (cf. Table 1). It can
be clearly seen that annotator A108 is an outlier.
A108 differs in her excessive use of label 999, as
shown in Figure 3. Indeed, by dropping A108,
we see that the IA score (Alpha) jumps from 0.67
to 0.8 for long. Similar results were obtained
for annotations for other words as well. Table 3
shows the jump in IA score after outlier(s) were
dropped.
Anveshan helps us differentiate between noisy
disagreement versus systematic disagreement.
The word show with 5 annotators has a low
agreement score of 0.45. By looking at the
sense distributions for the various annotators,
and observing annotation preferences for each
annotator, we can see that annotators A102 and
A105 have similar behavior (Figure 4, with a
pairwise alpha of 0.52 versus 0.46 for all five

annotators), and annotators A107 and A108 have
similar behavior (Figure 5, with a pairwise alpha
of 0.53). In contrast, Annotator A101 has very
distinct preferences (Figure 6). This behavior
is captured by computing JSD scores among all
pairs of annotators. As can be seen in Figure 7,
the pairs A102-A105 and A107-A108 have very
low JSD values, indicating similarity in annotator
behavior. At the same time we also see the pairs
having A101 in them have a much higher JSD
score, which is attributed to the fact that A101
is different from everyone else. If we look at
corresponding Alpha scores, we see that pairs
having low JSD values have higher agreement
scores and vice versa.
Observing the sense usage distributions also
helps us identify confusable senses. For example,
Figure 8 shows us the differences in sense usage
patterns of A101, A103 and the average of all
annotators for the word say. We can see that
A101 and A103 deviate in distinct ways from the
average. A101 prefers sense 101 whereas A103
prefers sense 102. This indicates that sense 101
and 102 might be confusable. Sense 1 is given
as ?expressing words?; sense 2 as ?report or
maintain?.

and MTs for fair
Anveshan not only helps us understand under-
lying patterns in annotator behavior and remove
noise from IA scores, but also helps identify
cases where there is no noise and no systematic
subsets of annotators that agree with each other.
An example can be seen in for the noun work. We
observed that the annotators do not have largely
different behavior, which is reflected in Figure 9.
As none of the annotators are significantly differ-
ent from the others, the KLD scores are low and
the plotted line does not have any steep rises, as
seen in Figure 2.
Similar to the results for TA data, Anveshan
was successful in identifying outliers in Mechan-
ical Turk data as well. In order to compare the
agreement among TAs and MTs, we looked at IA
scores of all subsets of annotators for the three ad-
jectives in the Mechanical Turk data. We observed
that MTs used much more senses than TAs for all
words and that there was a lot of noise in sense us-
age distribution. Figure 10 illustrates the sense us-
age statistics for long among MTs, for frequently
used senses.
We also looked at agreement scores among all
subsets of MTs to see if there are any subsets of
annotators who agree as much as TAs, and we ob-
served that for both long and quiet, there were no
53
subsets of MT annotators whose agreement was
comparable or greater than the same number of the
TAs, however for fair, we found one set of 5 an-
notators whose IA score (0.61) was greater than
the IA score (0.54) of trained annotators. We also
observed that among both these pairs of annota-
tors, the frequently used senses were the same, as
illustrated in Figure 11. Still, the two groups of an-
notators have sufficiently distinct sense usage that
the overall IA for the combined set drops to 0.43.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
For annotations on a subjective task, there are
cases where there is no single correct label. In
this paper, we presented Anveshan, an approach to
study annotator behavior and to explore datasets
with multiple annotators, and with a large set of
annotation values. Here we looked at data from
half a dozen trained annotators and fourteen un-
trained Mechanical Turkers on word sense anno-
tation for polysemous words. The analysis using
Anveshan provided many insights into sources of
disagreement among the annotators.
We learn that IA Scores do not give us a com-
plete picture and it is necessary to delve deeper
and study annotator behavior in order to identify
noise possibly due to sense confusability, to elim-
inate noise due to outliers, and to identify system-
atic differences where subsets of annotators have
much higher IA than the full set.
The results from Anveshan are encouraging and
the methodology can be readily extended to study
patterns in human behavior. We plan to extend
our work by looking at JSD scores of all subsets
of annotators instead of pairs, to identify larger
subsets of annotators who have similar behavior.
We also plan to investigate other statistical meth-
ods of outlier detection such as the orthogonalized
Gnanadesikan-Kettenring estimator.
