Abstract 
In this paper we describe the analytic 
question answering system HITIQA (High-
Quality Interactive Question Answering) 
which has been developed over the last 2 years 
as an advanced research tool for information 
analysts. HITIQA is an interactive open-
domain question answering technology 
designed to allow analysts to pose complex 
exploratory questions in natural language and 
obtain relevant information units to prepare 
their briefing reports. The system uses novel 
data-driven semantics to conduct a 
clarification dialogue with the user that 
explores the scope and the context of the 
desired answer space. The system has 
undergone extensive hands-on evaluations by 
a group of intelligence analysts. This 
evaluation validated the overall approach in 
HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the 
current prototype.  
1 Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as 
?What has been Russia?s reaction to the U.S. 
bombing of Kosovo?? The distinguishing property 
of such questions is that one cannot generally 
anticipate what might constitute the answer. While 
certain types of things may be expected (e.g., 
diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily 
conditioned by what information is in fact 
available on the topic. From a practical viewpoint, 
analytical questions are often underspecified, thus 
casting a broad net on a space of possible answers. 
Questions posed by professional analysts are 
aimed to probe the available data along certain 
dimensions. The results of these probes determine 
follow up questions, if necessary. Furthermore, at 
any stage clarifications may be needed to adjust 
the scope and intent of each question. Figure 1 
shows a fragment of an analytical session with 
HITIQA; note that these questions are not aimed at 
factoids, despite their simple form. 
User: What is the history of the nuclear arms 
program linking Iraq and other countries in the 
region? 
HITIQA: [responses and clarifications] 
User: Who financed the nuclear arms program 
in Iraq? 
HITIQA:? 
User: Has Iraq been able to import uranium? 
HITIQA:? 
User: What type of debt does exist between Iraq 
and her trading partners in the region? 
FIGURE 1: A fragment of an analyst?s session 
with HITIQA 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in 
the state of the art of automated question 
answering.  In this paper we focus on three aspects 
of our work: 
1. Question Semantics: how the system 
?understands? user requests 
2. Human-Computer Dialogue: how the user and 
the system negotiate this understanding 
3. User Evaluations and Results 
2 Factoid vs. Analytical QA 
There are significant differences between 
factoid, or fact-finding, and analytical question 
answering.  A factoid question is normally 
understood to seek a piece of information that 
would make a corresponding statement true (i.e., it 
becomes a fact): ?How many states are in the 
U.S.?? / ?There are X states in the U.S.? In this 
sense, a factoid question usually has just one 
correct answer that can generally be judged for its 
truthfulness with respect to some information 
source.  
As noted by Harabagiu et al (1999), factoid 
questions display a distinctive ?answer type?, 
which is the type of the information item needed 
for the answer, e.g., ?person? or ?country?, etc. 
Most existing factoid QA systems deduct this 
expected answer type from the form of the 
question using a finite list of possible answer 
types. For example, ?Who was the first man in 
space? expects a ?person? as the answer type. This 
is generally a very good strategy that has been 
exploited successfully in a number of automated 
QA systems, especially in the context of TREC 
QA1 evaluations. Given the excellent results posted 
by the best systems and an adequate performance 
attained even by some entry-level system, we 
believe that the process of factoid question 
answering is now fairly well understood 
(Harabagiu et al, 2002; Hovy et al, 2000; Prager 
at al., 2001, Wu et al, 2003). 
   In contrast to a factoid question, an analytical 
question has a virtually unlimited variety of 
syntactic forms with only a loose connection 
between their syntax and the expected answer. 
Given the many possible forms of analytical 
questions, it would be counter-productive to 
restrict them to a predefined number of 
question/answer types. Therefore, the formation of 
an answer in analytical QA should instead be 
guided by the user?s intended interest expressed in 
the question, as well as through any follow up 
dialogue with the system. This clearly involves 
user's intentions (the speech acts) and how they 
evolve with respect to the overall information 
strategy they are pursuing. 
In this paper we argue that the semantics 
(though not necessarily the intent) of an analytical 
question is more likely to be deduced from the 
information that is considered relevant to the 
question than through a detailed analysis of its 
particular form. We noted that the questions 
analysts ask, while clearly part of a strategy, are 
generally quite flexible and ?forgiving?, in the 
sense that there is always a strong possibility that 
the answer may not arrive in the expected form, 
and thus a change of strategy, and even the initial 
expectations, may be warranted. This suggests 
strongly that a solution to analytic QA must 
involve a dialogue that combines information 
seeking and problem solving strategies. 
3 Document Retrieval 
HITIQA works with unstructured text data, 
which means that a document retrieval step is 
required to detect any information that may be 
relevant to the user question. It has to be noted that 
determining ?relevant? information is not the same 
as finding an answer; indeed we can use relatively 
simple information retrieval methods (keyword 
matching, etc.) to obtain perhaps 200 ?relevant? 
                                                     
1 TREC QA is the annual Question Answering evaluation 
sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology 
www.trec.nist.gov 
documents from a database. This gives us an initial 
information space to work on in order to determine 
the scope and complexity of the answer, but we are 
nowhere near the answer yet. The current version 
of HITIQA uses the INQUERY system (Callan et 
al., 1992), although we have also used SMART 
(Buckley, 1985) and other IR systems (such as 
Google).   
4 Text Framing 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to 
delineate the gap between the possible meaning of 
the user?s question and the system ?understanding? 
of this question. We can approximate the meaning 
of the question by extracting references to known 
concepts in it, including named entities. The 
information retrieved from the database may well 
lead to other interpretations of the question, and we 
need to determine which of these are ?correct?.  
The framing process imposes a partial structure 
on the text passages that allows the system to 
systematically compare different passages against 
each other and against the question. Framing is not 
attempting to capture the entire meaning of the 
passage; it needs to be just sufficient enough to 
communicate with the user about the differences in 
their question and the returned text. In particular, 
the framing process may uncover topics or aspects 
within the answer space which the user has not 
explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of 
their existence. If these topics or aspects align 
closely with the user?s question, (i.e., matching 
many of the salient attributes) we may want to 
make the user aware of them and let him/her 
decide if they should be included in the answer.   
Frames are built from the retrieved data, after 
clustering it into several topical groups. Passages 
are clustered using a combination of hierarchical 
clustering and n-bin classification (Hardy et al, 
2002a). Each cluster represents a topic theme 
within the retrieved set: usually an alternative or 
complimentary interpretation of the user?s 
question. Since clusters are built out of small text 
passages, we initially associate a frame with each 
passage that serves as a seed of a cluster. We 
subsequently merge passages and their associated 
frames to arrive at one or more combined frames 
for the cluster. 
HITIQA starts text framing by building a 
general frame on the seed passages of the clusters 
and any of the top N (currently N=10) scored 
passages that are not already in a cluster. The 
general frame represents an event or a relation 
involving any number of entities, which make up 
the frame?s attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, 
ORGANIZATION, DATE, etc. Attributes are extracted 
from text passages by BBN?s Identifinder, which 
tags 24 types of named entities. The event/relation 
itself could be pretty much anything, e.g., accident, 
pollution, trade, etc. and it is captured into the 
TOPIC attribute from the central verb or noun 
phrase of the passage. In the general frame, 
attributes have no assigned roles; they are loosely 
grouped around the TOPIC (Figure 2).  
We have also defined three slightly more 
specialized typed frames by assigning roles to 
selected attributes in the general frame. These 
three ?specialized? frames are: (1) a Transfer 
frame with three roles including FROM, TO and 
OBJECT; (2) a two-role Relation frame with AGENT 
and OBJECT roles; and (3) an one-role Property 
frame. These typed frames represent certain 
generic events/relationships, which then map into 
more specific event types in each domain. Other 
frame types may be defined if needed, but we do 
not anticipate there will be more than a handful all 
together.2 For example, another 3-role frame may 
be State-Change frame with AGENT, OBJECT and 
INSTRUMENT roles, etc.3  
FRAME TYPE: General 
TOPIC: imported 
LOCATION: Iraq, France, Israel 
ORGANIZATION: IAEA [missed: Nukem] 
PERSON: Leonard Spector 
WEAPON: uranium, nuclear bomb 
DATES: 1981, 30 November 1990, .. 
FIGURE 2: A general frame obtained from the 
text passage in Figure 3 (not all attributes shown). 
 
Where the general frame is little more than just 
a ?bag of attributes?, the typed frames capture 
some internal structure of an event, but only to the 
extent required to enable an efficient dialogue with 
the user. Typed frames are ?triggered? by 
appearance of specific words in text, for example 
the word export may trigger a Transfer frame. A 
single text passage may invoke one or more typed 
frames, or none at all. When no typed frame is 
invoked, the general frame is used as default. If a 
typed frame is invoked, HITIQA will attempt to 
identify the roles, e.g. FROM, TO, OBJECT, etc. This 
is done by mapping general frame attributes 
selected from text onto the typed attributes in the 
frames. In any given domain, e.g., weapon non-
proliferation, both the trigger words and the role 
identification rules can be specialized from a 
                                                     
2 Scalability is certainly an outstanding issue here, and we are 
working on effective frame acquisition methods, which is outside of 
the scope of this paper. While classifications such as (Levin, 1993) or 
FrameNet (Fillmore, 2001) are relevant, we are currently aiming at a 
less detailed system. 
3 A more detailed discussion of possible frame types is beyond the 
scope of the current paper. 
training corpus of typical documents and 
questions. For example, the role-id rules rely both 
on syntactic cues and the expected entity types, 
which are domain adaptable.  
Domain adaptation is desirable for obtaining 
more focused dialogue, but it is not necessary for 
HITIQA to work. We used both setups under 
different conditions: the generic frames were used 
with TREC document collection to measure impact 
of IR precision on QA accuracy (Small et al, 
2004). The domain-adapted frames were used for 
sessions with intelligence analysts working with 
the WMD Domain (see below). Currently, the 
adaptation process includes manual tuning 
followed by corpus bootstrapping using an 
unsupervised learning method (Strzalkowski & 
Wang, 1996). We generally rely on BBN?s 
Identifinder for extraction of basic entities, and use 
bootstrapping to define additional entity types as 
well as to assign roles to attributes. 
The version of HITIQA reported here and used 
by analysts during the evaluation has been adapted 
to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-
Proliferation domain (WMD domain, henceforth).  
Figure 3 contains an example passage from this 
data set. In the WMD domain, the typed frames 
were mapped onto WMDTransfer 3-role frame, 
and two 2-role frames WMDTreaty  and 
WMDDevelop. Adapting the frames to the WMD 
domain required very minimal modification, such 
as adding the WEAPON entity to augment the 
Identifinder entity set, generating a list of 
international weapon control treaties, etc. 
The Bush Administration claimed that Iraq was 
within one year of producing a nuclear bomb. On 
30 November 1990... Leonard Spector said that 
Iraq possesses 200 tons of natural uranium 
imported and smuggled from several countries. 
Iraq possesses a few working centrifuges and the 
blueprints to build them. Iraq imported centrifuge 
materials from Nukem of the FRG and from other 
sources. One decade ago, Iraq imported 27 pounds 
of weapons-grade uranium from France, for Osirak 
nuclear research center. In 1981, Israel destroyed 
the Osirak nuclear reactor. In November 1990, the 
IAEA inspected Iraq and found all material 
accounted for....  
FIGURE 3: A text passage from the WMD 
domain data    
 
HITIQA frames define top-down constraints on 
how to interpret a given text passage, which is 
quite different from MUC4 template filling task 
                                                     
4 MUC, the Message Understanding Conference, funded by 
DARPA, involved the evaluation of information extraction systems 
applied to a common task. 
(Humphreys et al, 1998). What we?re trying to do 
here is to ?fit? a frame over a text passage. This 
also means that multiple frames can be associated 
with a text passage, or to be exact, with a cluster of 
passages. Since most of the passages that undergo 
the framing process are part of some cluster of 
very similar passages, the added redundancy helps 
to reinforce the most salient features for extraction. 
This makes the framing process potentially less 
error-prone than MUC-style template filling. 
A very similar framing process is applied to the 
user?s question, resulting in one or more Goal 
frames, which are subsequently compared to the 
data frames obtained from retrieved text passages. 
A Goal frame can be a general frame or any of the 
typed frames. Goal frames generated from the 
question, ?Has Iraq been able to import 
uranium?? are shown in Figures 4 and 5. 
FRAME TYPE: General 
TOPIC: import 
WEAPON:  uranium 
LOCATION: Iraq 
FIGURE 4: A general goal frame from the Iraq 
question 
The frame in Figure 4 is simply a General 
frame which is invoked first. HITIQA then 
discovers that TOPIC=import denotes a Transfer-
event in the WMD domain, so it creates a 
WMDTransfer frame that replaces the general 
frame. This new frame, shown in Figure 5, has 
three role attributes TRF_TO, TRF_FROM and 
TRF_OBJECT, plus the relation type (TRF_TYPE). 
Each role attribute is defined over an underlying 
general frame attribute (given in parentheses), 
which are used to compare frames of different 
types.  The role-id rules rely both on syntactic cues 
and the expected entity types, which are domain 
adaptable. 
FRAME TYPE: WMDTransfer 
TRF_TYPE (TOPIC): import 
TRF_TO (LOCATION): Iraq 
TRF_FROM (LOCATION, ORGANIZATION): ? 
TRF_OBJECT (WEAPON): uranium 
FIGURE 5: A typed goal frame from the Iraq 
question 
HITIQA automatically judges a particular data 
frame as relevant, and subsequently the 
corresponding segment of text as relevant, by 
comparison to the Goal frame. The data frames are 
scored based on the number of conflicts found with 
the Goal frame. The conflicts are mismatches on 
values of corresponding attributes, specifically 
when the data frame attribute list does not contain 
any of the entities in the corresponding Goal 
Frame attribute list.  If a data frame is found to 
have no conflicts, it is given the highest relevance 
rank, and a conflict score of zero.   
All other data frames are scored with an 
increasing value based on the number of conflicts, 
score 1 for frames with one conflict with the Goal 
frame, score 2 for two conflicts etc. Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the query are 
given the score 99 indicating the lowest rank. 
Currently, frames with a conflict score 99 are 
excluded from further processing as outliers. The 
frame in Figure 6 is scored as relevant to the user?s 
query and included in the answer space. 
FRAME TYPE: WMDTransfer 
TRF_TYPE (TOPIC): imported 
TRF_TO (LOCATION): Iraq 
TRF_FROM (LOCATION): France 
TRF_OBJECT (WEAPON): uranium 
CONFLICT SCORE: 0

text passage in Figure 3, in response to the Iraq 
question 
5 Enabling Dialogue with the User 
Framed information allows HITIQA to 
automatically judge text passages as fully or 
partially relevant and to conduct a meaningful 
dialogue with the user about their content. The 
purpose of the dialogue is to help the user navigate 
the answer space and to negotiate more precisely 
what information he or she is seeking. The main 
principle here is that the dialogue is primarily 
content oriented. Thus, it is okay to ask the user 
whether information about the AIDS conference in 
Cape Town should be included in the answer to a 
question about combating AIDS in Africa. 
However, the user should never be asked if a 
particular keyword is useful or not, or if a 
document is relevant or not.  
Our approach to dialogue in HITIQA is 
modeled to some degree upon the mixed-initiative 
dialogue management adopted in the AMITIES 
project (Hardy et al, 2002b). The main advantage 
of the AMITIES model is its reliance on data-
driven semantics which allows for spontaneous 
and mixed initiative dialogue to occur. By contrast, 
the major approaches to implementation of 
dialogue systems to date rely on systems of 
functional transitions that make the resulting 
system much less flexible. In the grammar-based 
approach, which is prevalent in commercial 
systems, such as in various telephony products, as 
well as in practically oriented research prototypes 
(e.g., DARPA Communicator; Seneff and Polifoni, 
2000; Ferguson and Allen, 1998), a complete 
dialogue transition graph is designed to guide the 
conversation and predict user responses, which is 
suitable for closed domains only. In the statistical 
variation of this approach, a transition graph is 
derived from a large body of annotated 
conversations (e.g., Walker, 2000; Litman and Pan, 
2002). This latter approach is facilitated through a 
dialogue annotation process, e.g., using Dialogue 
Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) (Allen 
and Core, 1997), which is a system of functional 
dialogue acts.  
Nonetheless, an efficient, spontaneous dialogue 
cannot be designed on a purely functional layer. 
Therefore, here we are primarily interested in the 
semantic layer, that is, the information exchange 
and information building effects of a conversation. 
In order to properly understand a dialogue, both 
semantic and functional layers need to be 
considered. In this paper we are concentrating 
exclusively on the semantic layer. 
6 Clarification Dialogue 
The clarification dialogue is when the user and 
the system negotiate the information task that 
needs to be performed. Data frames with a conflict 
score of 0 form the initial kernel answer space and 
HITIQA proceeds by generating an answer from 
this space. Depending upon the presence of other 
frames outside of this set, the system may initiate a 
dialogue with the user. When the Goal frame is a 
general frame HITIQA first initiates a clarification 
dialogue on existing general data frames that have 
one conflict. All of these 1-conflict general frames 
are first grouped on their common conflict 
attribute. HITIQA begins asking the user questions 
on these near-miss frame groups, with the largest 
group first. The groups must be at least groups of 
size N, where N is a user controlled setting.  This 
setting restricts of all HITIQA?s generated 
dialogue. HITIQA then check for the existence of 
any data frames that are one of the three typed 
frames. Clarification dialogue will be initiated on 
these, when all of their general attributes agree 
with the general attributes of the Goal frame 
respectively. Alternatively, if the Goal frame is one 
of the three type specific frames, a clarification 
dialogue is first initiated on groups of one conflict 
data frames that are the same type as the Goal 
frame. The clarification dialogue will then 
continue to the remaining two type specific frames 
if any exist, and finally on to any General data 
frames. 
A 1-conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal frame. This could be a 
mismatch on any of the general frame attributes, 
for example, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, 
etc., or in one of the role-assigned attributes, TO, 
FROM, OBJECT, etc.  A special case arises when the 
conflict occurs on the TOPIC attribute, which 
indicated the event type. Since all other attributes 
match, we may be looking at potentially different 
events (though similar type events) involving the 
same entities, occurring at the same location or 
time. The purpose of the clarification dialogue in 
this case is to probe which of these additional 
events may be of interest to the user.  
Another special case arises when the Goal 
frame has a different value of the TYPE attribute 
than a data frame. The purpose of the clarification 
dialogue here is to see if the user wishes to expand 
the answer space to include events of a different 
type. This situation is illustrated in the exchange 
shown in Figure 7.  
The clarification question asked by HITIQA in 
Figure 7 was obtained by comparing the Goal 
frame (Figure 5) to a partly matching frame 
(Figure 8) generated from another text passage. 
We note first that the Goal frame for this example 
is WMDTransfer type, while the data frame in 
Figure 8 is WMDDevelop type. Nonetheless, both 
frames match on their general-frame attributes 
WEAPON and LOCATION. Therefore, HITIQA asks 
the user if it should expand the answer space to 
include development of uranium in Iraq as well. 
User: ?Has Iraq been able to import uranium?? 
HITIQA: IRAQ REPORTED TO HAVE 
IMPORTED MISSILES AND URANIUM  
Supporting passage:  
...that Iraq possesses 200 tons of natural 
uranium imported and smuggled from several 
countries. Iraq possesses a few working 
centrifuges and the blueprints to build them. Iraq 
imported centrifuge materials from Nukem of the 
FRG and from other sources. One decade ago, 
Iraq imported 27 pounds of weapons-grade 
uranium from France, for Osirak nuclear research 
center... 
HITIQA: ?Are you also interested in 
background information on the uranium 
development program in Iraq?? 
User: ? 
 
FIGURE 7:  The clarification dialogue detail 
During the dialogue, as new information is 
obtained from the user, the Goal frame is updated 
and the scores of all the data frames are 
reevaluated.  If the user responds the equivalent of 
?yes? to the system clarification question in the 
dialogue in Figure 7, a corresponding 
WMDDevelop frame will be added to the set of 
active Goal frames and all WMDDevelop frames 
obtained from text passages will be re-scored for 
possible inclusion in the answer. 
FRAME TYPE: WMDDevelop    
DEV_TYPE (TOPIC): development, produced 
DEV_OBJ (WEAPON): nuc. weapons, uranium 
DEV_AGENT (LOCATION): Iraq, Tuwaitha 
CONFLICT SCORE: 2 
Conflicts with FRAME_TYPE and TOPIC  
FIGURE 8: A 2-conflict frame against the 
Iraq/uranium question that generated the dialogue 
in Figure 7. 
The user may end the dialogue at any point using 
the generated answer given the current state of the 
frames. Currently, the answer is simply composed 
of text passages from the zero conflict frames. In 
addition, HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for 
the text passages in the answer space.  This is done 
using a combination of text templates and simple 
grammar rules applied to the attributes of the 
passage frame. Figure 7 shows a portion of the 
answer generated by HITIQA for the Iraq query. 
7 HITIQA Preliminary Evaluations 
We have evaluated HITIQA in a series of 
workshops with professional analysts in order to 
obtain an in-depth and comprehensive assessment 
of the system usability and performance. In 
addition to evaluating our research progress, the 
purpose of these workshops was to test several 
evaluation instruments to see if they can be 
meaningfully applied to a complex information 
system such as HITIQA. 
     For the participating analysts, the primary 
activity at these workshops involved preparation of 
reports in response to ?scenarios? ? complex 
questions that often encompass multiple sub-
questions, aspects and hypotheses. For example, in 
one scenario, analysts were asked ti locate 
information about the al Qaeda terorist group: its 
membership, sources of funding and activities. In 
another scenario, the analysts were requested to 
find information on the chemical weapon Sarin. 
Figure 9 shows one of the analytical scenarios used 
in these workshops. We prepared a database of 
over 1GByte of text documents; it included articles 
from the Center for Non-proliferation (CNS) data 
collected for the AQUAINT program and similar 
data retrieved from the web using Google. The 
analysts? task was to prepare a report ?as much like 
what you would do in your normal work 
environment as possible.? Over the six days of the 
workshops, each analyst prepared five such reports 
in sessions of one to three hours. Each session 
involved multiple questions posed to the system, as 
well as clarification dialogue, visual browsing and 
report construction. Figure 10 shows an abridged 
transcript from another analytical session with 
HITIQA.  
 Figure 9: A scenario level analytic task  
One of our primary concerns was to design 
tasks that were similar in scope and difficulty to 
those that the analysts are used to performing at 
work and to ensure that they felt comfortable using 
the system. 5 questions in the scenario evaluation 
dealt with this issue; for example, one question 
asked how the scenarios compared in difficulty 
with the tasks the analysts normally perform at 
work. The mean score for these five questions was 
3.75 on a 5 point scale (five is the best score). The 
lowest score (M=2.88) was received on the 
question ?How did the scenario compare in 
difficulty to tasks that you normally perform at 
work??; this slightly above average rating of 
difficulty of the tasks was quite satisfactory for our 
purposes.  
    In the final evaluation, analysts were asked to 
rate their agreement with statements such as 
?Having HITIQA helps me find important 
information? (score 4.50), ?Having Hitiqa at work 
would help me find information faster than I can 
currently find it? (score 4.33), and ?Hitiqa would 
be a useful addition to the tools that I already have 
at work? (score 4.25). The mean normalized score 
for the combined final evaluation of Workshop I 
was 3.75 on the 5 point scale; this means that the 
system received many more ratings of 4 and 5 than 
of 1 and 2. Comments made by the analysts in the 
group discussion and in the individual interviews 
confirmed that analysts liked the interactive 
dialogue and were very pleased with the results. 
For example, one analyst said ?I learned more 
about Sarin gas in 30 minutes than I probably 
would have at work in a half a day.? As desired, 
the analysts also made many suggestions for 
improving the interface and the interoperation of 
The department chief has requested a report by the 
close of business today on the nuclear arms program in 
Iraq and how it was influenced by the neighboring 
countries. List the extent of the nuclear program in each 
involved country including funding, capabilities, quantity, 
etc. Your report should also include key figures in Iraq 
nuclear program as well as in other countries in the region, 
and,any travels that these key figures have made to other 
countries in regards to a nuclear program, any weapons 
that have been used in the past by either country, any 
purchases or trades that have been made relevant to 
weapons of mass destruction (possibly oil trade, etc.), any 
ingredients and chemicals that have been used, any 
potential weapons that could be under development, 
countries that are involved or have close ties to Iraq or her 
trade partners, possible locations of development sites, and 
possible companies or organizations that these countries 
work with for their nuclear arms program. Add any other 
information relating to the Iraqi Nuclear Arms Programs.  
the visual and text display. For a research system 
undergoing its first rigorous evaluation, these 
results are very satisfactory ? they support the

The AQUAINT Program has entered its second 
phase in May 2004. Over the next 2 years our 
focus will be on augmenting HITIQA to provide 
more advanced dialogue capabilities, including 
problem solving dialogue related to hypothesis 
formation and verification. This implies building 
up system?s knowledge acquisition capabilities by 
exploiting diverse data sources, including 
structured databases and the internet.

Abstract 
In this paper we describe the analytic question 
answering system HITIQA (High-Quality In-
teractive Question Answering) which has been 
developed over the last 2 years as an advanced 
research tool for information analysts. 
HITIQA is an interactive open-domain ques-
tion answering technology designed to allow 
analysts to pose complex exploratory ques-
tions in natural language and obtain relevant 
information units to prepare their briefing re-
ports. The system uses novel data-driven se-
mantics to conduct a clarification dialogue 
with the user that explores the scope and the 
context of the desired answer space. The sys-
tem has undergone extensive hands-on evalua-
tions by a group of intelligence analysts repre-
senting various foreign intelligence services.  
This evaluation validated the overall approach 
in HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the 
current prototype.  
1   Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to submit 
exploratory, analytical questions, such as ?What has 
been Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kosovo?? 
The distinguishing property of such questions is that one 
cannot generally anticipate what might constitute the 
answer. While certain types of things may be expected 
(e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily con-
ditioned by what information is in fact available on the 
topic. From a practical viewpoint, analytical questions 
are often underspecified, thus casting a broad net on a 
space of possible answers. Questions posed by profes-
sional analysts are aimed to probe the available data 
along certain dimensions. The results of these probes 
determine follow up questions, if necessary. Further-
more, at any stage clarifications may be needed to adjust 
the scope and intent of each question. Figure 1a shows a 
fragment of an analytical session with HITIQA; please 
note that these questions are not aimed at factoids, de-
spite appearances.  HITIQA project is part of the ARDA 
AQUAINT program that aims to make significant ad-
vances in state of the art of automated question answer-
ing.

tween Russia and Iraq?

FIGURE 1a: A fragment of analytic session    
2   Factoid vs. Analytical QA 
The process of automated question answering is now 
fairly well understood for most types of factoid ques-
tions. Factoid questions display a fairly distinctive ?an-
swer type?, which is the type of the information item 
needed for the answer, e.g., ?person? or ?country?, etc. 
Most existing factoid QA systems deduct this expected 
answer type from the form of the question using a finite 
list of possible answer types. For example, ?How long 
was the Titanic?? expects some length measure as an 
answer, probably in yards and feet, or meters. This is 
generally a very good strategy that has been exploited 
successfully in a number of automated QA systems that 
appeared in recent years, especially in the context of 
TREC QA1  evaluations (Harabagiu et al, 2002; Hovy 
et al, 2000; Prager at al., 2001).     
This answer-typing process is not easily applied to 
analytical questions because the type of an answer for 
analytical questions cannot always be anticipated due to 
their inherently exploratory character.  In contrast to a 
factoid question, an analytical question has an unlimited 
variety of syntactic forms with only a loose connection 
between their syntax and the expected answer.  Given 
the unlimited potential of the formation of analytical 
questions, it would be counter-productive to restrict 
them to a limited number of question/answer types.  
Therefore, the formation of an answer in analytical QA 
should instead be guided by the user?s interest as ex-
pressed in the question, as well as through an interactive 
dialogue with the system.  
In this paper we argue that the semantics of an ana-
lytical question is more likely to be deduced from the 
                                                 
1 TREC QA is the annual Question Answering evaluation sponsored 
by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology 
www.trec.nist.gov 
 information that is considered relevant to the question 
than through a detailed analysis of its particular form. 
Determining ?relevant? information is not the same as 
finding an answer; indeed we can use relatively simple 
information retrieval methods (keyword matching, etc.) 
to obtain perhaps 200 ?relevant? documents from a da-
tabase. This gives us an initial answer space to work 
from in order to determine the scope and complexity of 
the answer, but we are nowhere near the answer yet. In 
our project, we use structured templates, which we call 
frames, to map out the content of pre-retrieved docu-
ments, and subsequently to delineate the possible mean-
ing of the question before we can attempt to formulate 
an answer. 
3   Text Framing 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to delineate 
the gap between the meaning of the user?s question and 
the system?s ?understanding? of this question. The 
framing process does not attempt to capture the entire 
meaning of the passages; instead it imposes a partial 
structure on the text passages that would allow the sys-
tem to systematically compare different passages 
against each other and against the question.  Framing is 
just sufficient enough to communicate with the user 
about the differences in their question and the returned 
text. In particular, the framing process may uncover 
topics or aspects within the answer space which the user 
has not explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of 
their existence. If these topics or aspects align closely 
with the user?s question, we may want to make the user 
aware of them and let him/her decide if they should be 
included in the answer.   
Frames are built from the retrieved data, after clus-
tering it into several topical groups. Retrieved docu-
ments are first broken down into passages, mostly ex-
ploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of 
the original sources, filtering out duplicates.  The re-
maining passages are clustered using a combination of 
hierarchical clustering and n-bin classification (Hardy et 
al., 2002).  Typically three to six clusters are generated.  
Each cluster represents a topic theme within the re-
trieved set: usually an alternative or complimentary in-
terpretation of the user?s question. Since clusters are 
built out of small text passages, we associate a frame 
with each passage that serves as a seed of a cluster. We 
subsequently merge passages, and their associated 
frames whenever anaphoric and other cohesive links are 
detected.   
HITIQA starts by building a general frame on the 
seed passages of the clusters and any of the top N (cur-
rently N=10) scored passages that are not already in a 
cluster. The general frame represents an event or a rela-
tion involving any number of entities, which make up 
the frame?s attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, 
COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, etc. Attributes are extracted 
from text passages by BBN?s Identifinder, which tags 
24 types of named entities. The event/relation itself 
could be pretty much anything, e.g., accident, pollution, 
trade, etc. and it is captured into the TOPIC attribute 
from the central verb or noun phrase of the passage. In 
general frames, attributes have no assigned roles; they 
are loosely grouped around the TOPIC.  
We have also defined three slightly more specialized 
typed frames by assigning roles to selected attributes in 
the general frame. These three ?specialized? frames are: 
(1) a Transfer frame with three roles including FROM, TO 
and OBJECT; (2) a two-role Relation frame with AGENT 
and OBJECT roles; and (3) a one-role Property frame. 
These typed frames represent certain generic 
events/relationships, which then map into more specific 
event types in each domain. Other frame types may be 
defined if needed, but we do not anticipate there will be 
more than a handful all together.2 Where the general 
frame is little more than just a ?bag of attributes?, the 
typed frames capture some internal structure of an 
event, but only to the extent required to enable an effi-
cient dialogue with the user. Typed frames are ?trig-
gered? by appearance of specific words in text, for ex-
ample the word export may trigger a Transfer frame. A 
single text passage may invoke one or more typed 
frames, or none at all. When no typed frame is invoked, 
the general frame is used as default. If a typed frame is 
invoked, HITIQA will attempt to identify the roles, e.g. 
FROM, TO, OBJECT, etc. This is done by mapping general 
frame attributes selected from text onto the typed attrib-
utes in the frames. In any given domain, e.g., weapon 
non-proliferation, both the trigger words and the role 
identification rules can be specialized from a training 
corpus of typical documents and questions. For exam-
ple, the role-ID rules rely both on syntactic cues and the 
expected entity types, which are domain adaptable.  
Domain adaptation is desirable for obtaining more 
focused dialogue, but it is not necessary for HITIQA to 
work. We used both setups under different conditions: 
the generic frames were used with TREC document 
collection to measure impact of IR precision on QA 
accuracy (Small et al, 2004). The domain-adapted 
frames were used for sessions with intelligence analysts 
working with the WMD Domain (see below). Currently, 
the adaptation process includes manual tuning followed 
by corpus bootstrapping using an unsupervised learning 
method (Strzalkowski & Wang, 1996). We generally 
rely on BBN?s Identifinder for extraction of basic enti-
ties, and use bootstrapping to define additional entity 
types as well as to assign roles to attributes. 
The version of HITIQA reported here and used by 
analysts during the evaluation has been adapted to the 
                                                 
2 Scalability is certainly an outstanding issue here, and we are work-
ing on effective frame acquisition methods, which is outside of the 
scope of this paper. 
 Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-Proliferation do-
main (WMD domain, henceforth).  Figure 1b contains 
an example passage from this data set. In the WMD 
domain, the typed frames were mapped onto 
WMDTransfer 3-role frame, and two 2-role frames 
WMDTreaty  and WMDDevelop. Adapting the frames to 
WMD domain required only minimal modification, 
such as adding WEAPON entity to augment Identifinder 
entity set, specializing OBJECT attribute in WMDTrans-
fer to WEAPON, generating a list of international weapon 
control treaties, etc. 
HITIQA frames define top-down constraints on how 
to interpret a given text passage, which is quite different 
from MUC3 template filling task (Humphreys et al, 
1998). What we?re trying to do here is to ?fit? a frame 
over a text passage. This means also that multiple 
frames can be associated with a text passage, or to be 
exact, with a cluster of passages. Since most of the pas-
sages that undergo the framing process are part of some 
cluster of very similar passages, the added redundancy 
helps to reinforce the most salient features for extrac-
tion. This makes the framing process potentially less 
error-prone than MUC-style template filling4.  
The Bush Administration claimed that Iraq was within one 
year of producing a nuclear bomb. On 30 November 1990... 
Leonard Spector said that Iraq possesses 200 tons of natural 
uranium imported and smuggled from several countries. Iraq 
possesses a few working centrifuges and the blueprints to 
build them. Iraq imported centrifuge materials from Nukem of 
the FRG and from other sources. One decade ago, Iraq im-
ported 27 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from France, ... 
FIGURE 1b: A text passage from the WMD domain data    
A very similar framing process is applied to the 
user?s question, resulting in one or more Goal frames, 
which are subsequently compared to the data frames 
obtained from retrieved text passages. A Goal frame can 
be a general frame or any of the typed frames. The Goal 
frame generated from the question, ?Has Iraq been able 
to import uranium?? is shown in Figure 2. This frame is 
of WMDTransfer type, with 3 role attributes TRF_TO, 
TRF_FROM and TRF_OBJECT, plus the relation type 
(TRF_TYPE). Each role attribute is defined over an un-
derlying general frame attribute (given in parentheses), 
which is used to compare frames of different types.  
HITIQA automatically judges a particular data 
frame as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding 
segment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal 
frame. The data frames are scored based on the number 
of conflicts found with the Goal frame. The conflicts are 
mismatches on values of corresponding attributes. If a

involved the evaluation of information extraction systems applied to a 
common task.

time. 
data frame is found to have no conflicts, it is given the 
highest relevance rank, and a conflict score of zero.   
FRAME TYPE: WMDTransfer 
TRF_TYPE (TOPIC): import 
TRF_TO (LOCATION): Iraq 
TRF_FROM (LOCATION, ORGANIZATION): ?

TRF_OBJECT (WEAPON): uranium 
CONFLICT SCORE: 0 
FIGURE 3: A frame obtained from the text passage in 
Figure 1b, in response to the Iraq question 
All other data frames are scored with an increasing 
value based on the number of conflicts, score 1 for 
frames with one conflict with the Goal frame, score 2 
for two conflicts etc. Frames that conflict with all in-
formation found in the query are given the score 99 in-
dicating the lowest rank. Currently, frames with a con-
flict score 99 are excluded from further processing as 
outliers. The frame in Figure 3 is scored as relevant to 
the user?s query and included in the answer space. 
4   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space and HITIQA proceeds by 
generating an answer from this space. Depending upon 
the presence of other frames outside of this set, the sys-
tem may initiate a dialogue with the user. HITIQA be-
gins asking the user questions on these near-miss frame 
groups, groups with one or more conflicts, with the 
largest group first. In order to keep the dialogue from 
getting too winded, we set thresholds on number of con-
flicts and group size that are considered by the dialogue 
manager.  
A 1-conflict frame has only a single attribute mis-
match with the Goal frame. This could be a mismatch 
on any of the general frame attributes, for example, LO-
CATION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, etc., or in one of the 
role-assigned attributes, TO, FROM, OBJECT, etc.  A spe-
cial case arises when the conflict occurs on the TOPIC 
attribute, which indicates the event type.  Since all other 
attributes match, we may be looking at potentially dif-
ferent events of the same kind involving the same enti-
ties, possibly occurring at the same location or time. 
The purpose of the clarification dialogue in this case is 
to probe which of these topics may be of interest to the 
user. Another special case arises when the Goal frame is 
of a different type than a data frame.  The purpose of the 
clarification dialogue in this case is to see if the user 
wishes to expand the answer space to include events of 
a different type. This situation is illustrated in the ex-
 change shown in Figure 4. Note that the user can exam-
ine a partial answer prior to answering clarification 
questions.   
User: ?Has Iraq been able to import uranium?? 
[a partial answer displayed in an answer window] 
HITIQA: ?Are you also interested in background information 
on the uranium development program in Iraq?? 
FIGURE 4:  Clarification question generated for the 
Iraq/uranium question 
The clarification question in Figure 4 is generated by 
comparing the Goal frame in Figure 2 to a partly match-
ing frame (Figure 5) generated from some other text 
passage. We note first that the Goal frame for this ex-
ample is of WMDTransfer type, while the data frame in 
Figure 5 is of the type WMDDevelop. Nonetheless, both 
frames match on their general-frame attributes WEAPON 
and LOCATION. Therefore, HITIQA asks the user if it 
should expand the answer space to include development 
of uranium in Iraq as well. 
During the dialogue, as new information is obtained 
from the user, the Goal frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated.  If the user re-
sponds the equivalent of ?yes? to the system clarifica-
tion question in the dialogue in Figure 4, a correspond-
ing WMDDevelop frame will be added to the set of ac-
tive Goal frames and all WMDDevelop frames obtained 
from text passages will be re-scored for possible inclu-
sion in the answer.  
FRAME TYPE: WMDDevelop    
DEV_TYPE (TOPIC): development, produced 
DEV_OBJECT (WEAPON): nuclear weapons, uranium 
DEV_AGENT (LOCATION): Iraq, Tuwaitha 
CONFLICT SCORE: 2 
Conflicts with FRAME_TYPE and TOPIC  
FIGURE 5: A 2-conflict frame against the Iraq/uranium ques-
tion that generated the dialogue in Figure 4. 
The user may end the dialogue at any point using the 
generated answer given the current state of the frames. 
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text pas-
sages from the zero conflict frames. In addition, 
HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for the text passages 
in the answer space.  This is done using a combination 
of text templates and simple grammar rules applied to 
the attributes of the passage frame.   
5   HITIQA Qualitative Evaluations 
In order to assess our progress thus far, and to also 
develop metrics to guide future evaluation, we invited a 
group of analysts employed by the US government to 
participate in two three-day workshops, held in Septem-
ber and October 2003.  
The two basic objectives of the workshops were: 
1. To perform a realistic assessment of the useful-
ness and usability of HITIQA as an end-to-end system, 
from the information seeker's initial questions to com-
pletion of a draft report.  
2. To develop metrics to compare the answers ob-
tained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of 
the support that HITIQA provides.     
The analysts' primary task was preparation of reports 
in response to scenarios - complex questions that usu-
ally encompassed multiple sub-questions. The scenarios 
were developed in conjunction with several U.S. gov-
ernment offices. These scenarios, detailing information 
required for the final report, were not normally used 
directly as questions to HITIQA, instead, they were 
treated as a basis to issues possibly leading to a series of 
questions, as shown in Figure 1a. 
The results of these evaluations strongly validated 
our approach to analytical QA. At the same time, we 
learned a great deal about how analysts work, and about 
how to improve the interface.  
Analysts completed several questionnaires de-
signed to assess their overall experience with the sys-
tem.  Many of the questions required the analysts to 
compare HITIQA to other tools they were currently 
using in their work. HITIQA scores were quite high, 
with mean score 3.73 out of 5.  We scored particularly 
high in comparison to current analytic tools. We have 
also asked the analysts to cross-evaluate their product 
reports obtained from interacting with HITIQA. Again, 
the results were quite good with a mean answer quality 
score of 3.92 out of 5. While this evaluation was only 
preliminary, it nonetheless gave us confidence that our 
design is ?correct? in a broad sense.5

Abstract
HITIQA is an interactive question answering 
technology designed to allow intelligence analysts 
and other users of information systems to pose 
questions in natural language and obtain relevant 
answers, or the assistance they require in order to 
perform their tasks. Our objective in HITIQA is to 
allow the user to submit exploratory, analytical, 
non-factual questions, such as ?What has been 
Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kosovo?? 
The distinguishing property of such questions is 
that one cannot generally anticipate what might 
constitute the answer. While certain types of things 
may be expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the 
answer is heavily conditioned by what information 
is in fact available on the topic. From a practical 
viewpoint, analytical questions are often under-
specified, thus casting a broad net on a space of 
possible answers. Therefore, clarification dialogue 
is often needed to negotiate with the user the exact 
scope and intent of the question. 
 
1   Introduction 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in 
the state of the art of automated question answer-
ing.  In this paper we focus on two aspects of our 
work: 
1. Question Semantics: how the system ?un-
derstands? user requests. 
2. Human-Computer Dialogue: how the user 
and the system negotiate this understand-
ing. 
     We will also discuss very preliminary evalua-
tion results from a series of pilot tests of the system 
conducted by intelligence analysts via a remote 
internet link.  
   
2   Factual vs. Analytical 
The objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit and obtain answers to exploratory, analyti-
cal, non-factual questions.  There are very signifi-
cant differences between factual, or fact-finding, 
and analytical question answering. A factual ques-
tion seeks pieces of information that would make a 
corresponding statement true (i.e., they become 
facts): ?How many states are in the U.S.?? / ?There 
are X states in the U.S.? In this sense, a factual 
question usually has just one correct answer that 
can generally, be judged for its truthfulness. By 
contrast, an analytical question is when the ?truth? 
of the answer is more a matter of opinion and may 
depend upon the context in which the question is 
asked. Answers to analytical questions are rarely 
unilateral, indeed, a mere ?correct? answer may 
have limited value, and in some cases may not 
even be determinate (?Which college is the best??, 
?How do I stop my baby?s crying??). Instead, an-
swers to analytical questions are often judged as 
helpful, or useful, or satisfactory, etc. ?Technically 
correct? answers (e.g., ?feed the baby milk?) may 
be considered as irrelevant or at best unresponsive.   
     The distinction between factual and analytical 
questions depends primarily on the intention of the 
person who is asking, however, the form of a ques-
tion is often indicative of which of the two classes 
it is more likely to belong to.  Factual questions 
can be classified into a number of syntactic formats 
(?question typology?) that aids in automatic proc-
essing. 
     Factual questions display a fairly distinctive 
?answer type?, which is the type of the information 
piece needed to fulfill the statement.  Recent auto-
mated systems for answering factual questions  
deduct  this expected answer type from the form of 
the question and a finite list of possible answer 
 types. For example, ?Who was the first man in 
space? expects a ?person? as the answer, while 
?How long was the Titanic?? expects some length 
measure as an answer, probably in yards and feet, 
or meters.  This is generally a very good strategy, 
that has been exploited successfully in a number of 
automated QA systems that appeared in recent 
years, especially in the context of TREC QA1 
evaluations (Harabagiu et al, 2000; Hovy et al, 
2000; Prager at al., 2001).     
     This process is not easily applied to analytical 
questions. This is because the type of an answer for 
analytical questions cannot always be anticipated 
due to their inherently exploratory character.  In 
contrast to a factual question, an analytical ques-
tion has an unlimited variety of syntactic forms 
with only a loose connection between their syntax 
and the expected answer.  Given the unlimited po-
tential of the formation of analytical questions, it 
would be counter-productive to restrict them to a 
limited number of question/answer types. Even 
finding a non-strictly factual answer to an other-
wise simple question about Titanic length (e.g., 
?two football fields?) would push the limits of the 
answer-typing approach. Therefore, the formation 
of an answer should instead be guided by the top-
ics the user is interested in, as recognized in the 
query and/or through the interactive dialogue, 
rather than by a single type as inferred from the 
query in a factual system.   
     This paper argues that the semantics of an ana-
lytical question is more likely to be deduced from 
the information that is considered relevant to the 
question than through a detailed analysis of their 
particular form. While this may sound circular, it 
needs not be. Determining ?relevant? information 
is not the same as finding an answer; indeed we 
can use relatively simple information retrieval 
methods (keyword matching, etc.) to obtain per-
haps 50 or 100 ?relevant? documents from a data-
base. This gives us an initial answer space to work 
on in order to determine the scope and complexity 
of the answer. In our project, we use structured 
templates, which we call frames to map out the 
content of pre-retrieved documents, and subse-
quently to delineate the possible meaning of the 
question (Section 6).

tion sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology www.trec.nist.gov. 
 
3   Document Retrieval 
When the user poses a question to a system sitting 
atop a huge database of unstructured data (text 
files), the first order of business is to reduce that 
pile to perhaps a handful of documents where the 
answer is likely to be found. This means, most of-
ten, document retrieval, using fast but non-exact 
selection methods.  Questions are tokenized and 
sent to a document retrieval engine, such as Smart 
(Buckley, 1985) or InQuery (Callan et al, 1992).  
Noun phrases and verb phrases are extracted from 
the question to give us a list of potential topics that 
the user may be interested in.   
    In the experiments with the HITIQA prototype, 
see Figure 1, we are retrieving the top fifty docu-
ments from three gigabytes of newswire 
(AQUAINT corpus plus web-harvested docu-
ments).

4   Data Driven Semantics of Questions 
The set of documents and text passages returned 
from the initial search is not just a random subset 
of the database. Depending upon the quality (recall 
and precision) of the text retrieval system avail-
 able, this set can be considered as a first stab at 
understanding the user?s question by the machine.  
Again, given the available resources, this is the 
best the system can do under the circumstances. 
Therefore, we may as well consider this collection 
of retrieved texts (the Retrieved Set) as the mean-
ing of the question as understood by the system. 
This is a fair assessment: the better our search ca-
pabilities, the closer this set would be to what the 
user may accept as an answer to the question.  
     We can do better, however. We can perform 
automatic analysis of the retrieved set, attempting 
to uncover if it is a fairly homogenous bunch (i.e., 
all texts have very similar content), or whether 
there are a number of diverse topics represented 
there, somehow tied together by a common thread. 
In the former case, we may be reasonably confi-
dent that we have the answer, modulo the retriev-
able information. In the latter case, we know that 
the question is more complex than the user may 
have intended, and a negotiation process is needed. 
     We can do better still. We can measure how 
well each of the topical groups within the retrieved 
set is ?matching up? against the question. This is 
accomplished through a framing process described 
later in this paper. The outcome of the framing 
process is twofold: firstly, the alternative interpre-
tations of the question are ranked within 3 broad 
categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers. 
Secondly, salient concepts and attributes for each 
topical group are extracted into topic frames. This 
enables the system to conduct a meaningful dia-
logue with the user, a dialogue which is wholly 
content oriented, and thus entirely data driven.  
ON-TARGET
OUTLIERS
NEAR-MISSES
 
Figure 2: Answer Space Topology.  The goal of interac-
tive QA it to optimize the ON-TARGET middle zone. 
 
5   Clustering 
We use n-gram-based clustering of text passages 
and concept extraction  to uncover the main topics, 
themes and entities in this set.  
     Retrieved documents are first broken into natu-
rally occurring paragraphs.  Duplicate paragraphs 
are filtered out and the remaining passages are 
clustered using a combination of hierarchical clus-
tering and n-bin classification (details of the clus-
tering algorithm can be found in Hardy et al, 
2002a).  Typically three to six clusters are gener-
ated out of the top 50 documents, which may yield 
as many as 1000 passages.  Each cluster represents 
a topic theme within the retrieved set: usually an 
alternative or complimentary interpretation of the 
user?s question. 
    A list of topic labels is assigned to each cluster. 
A topic label may come from one of two places:  
First, the texts in the cluster are compared against 
the list of key phrases extracted from the user?s 
query.  For each match found, the matching phrase 
is used as a topic label for the cluster. If a match 
with the key phrases from the question cannot be 
obtained, Wordnet is consulted to see if a common 
ancestor can be found. For example, ?rifle? and 
?machine gun? are kinds of ?weaponry? in Word-
net, which allows an indirect match between a 
question about weapon inspectors and a text re-
porting a discovery by the authorities of a cache of 
?rifles? and ?machine guns?.  
 
6   Framing 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to de-
lineate the gap between the meaning of the user?s 
question and the system ?understanding? of this 
question. The framing is an attempt to impose a 
partial structure on the text that would allow the 
system to systematically compare different text 
pieces against each other and against the question, 
and also to communicate with the user about this. 
In particular, the framing process may uncover 
topics and themes within the retrieved set which 
the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus may 
be unaware of their existence. Nonetheless these 
may carry important information ? the NEAR-
MISSES in Figure 2. 
     In the current version of the system, frames are 
fairly generic templates, consisting of a small 
number of attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, 
COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, etc.  Future versions of 
HITIQA will add domain specialized frames, for 
example, we are currently constructing frames for 
the Weapons Non-proliferation Domain. Most of 
the frame attributes are defined in advance, how-
 ever, dynamic frame expansion is also possible. 
Each of the attributes in a frame is equipped with 
an extractor function which specializes in locating 
and extracting instances of this attribute in the run-
ning text. The extractors are implemented using 
information extraction utilities which form the ker-
nel of Sheffield?s GATE2 system.  We have modi-
fied GATE to separate organizations into compa-
nies and other organizations, and we have also ex-
panded by adding new concepts such as industries.  
Therefore, the framing process resembles strongly 
the template filling task in information extraction 
(cf. MUC3 evaluations), with one significant ex-
ception: while the MUC task was to fill in a tem-
plate using potentially any amount of source text 
(Humphreys et al, 1998), the framing is essentially 
an inverse process. In framing, potentially multiple 
frames can be associated with a small chunk of text 
(a passage or a short paragraph). Furthermore, this 
chunk of text is part of a cluster of very similar text 
chunks that further reinforce some of the most sali-
ent features of these texts. This makes the frame 
filling a significantly less error-prone task ? our 
experience has been far more positive than the 
MUC evaluation results may indicate. This is be-
cause, rather than trying to find the most appropri-
ate values for attributes from among many poten-
tial candidates, we in essence fit the frames over 
small passages4.  
Therefore, data frames are built from the re-
trieved data, after clustering it into several topical 
groups. Since clusters are built out of small text 
passages, we associate a frame with each passage 
that serves as a seed of a cluster. We subsequently 
merge passages, and their associated frames when-
ever anaphoric and other cohesive links are de-
tected.   
     A very similar process is applied to the user?s 
question, resulting in a Goal Frame which can be 
subsequently compared to the data frames obtained 
from retrieved data. For example, the Goal Frame 
generated from the question, ?How has pollution in 
the Black Sea affected the fishing industry, and 
                                                 
2 GATE is Generalized Architecture for Text Engineering, an 
information extraction system developed at the University of 
Sheffield (Cunningham, 2000). 
3 MUC, the Message Understanding Conference, funded by 
ARPA, involved the evaluation of information extraction sys-
tems applied to a common task. 
4 We should note that selecting the right frame type for a pas-
sage is an important pre-condition to ?understanding?. 
what are the sources of this pollution?? is shown 
in Figure 3 below.

INDUSTRY :[fisheries, tourism] 
TEXT: [In a period of only three decades (1960's-1980's), 
the Black Sea has suffered the catastrophic degradation 
of a major part of its natural resources. Particularly acute 
problems have arisen as a result of pollution (notably 
from nutrients, fecal material, solid waste and oil), a 
catastrophic decline in commercial fish stocks, a severe 
decrease in tourism and an uncoordinated approach to-
wards coastal zone management. Increased loads of nutri-
ents from rivers and coastal sources caused an overpro-
duction of phytoplankton leading to extensive eutrophica-
tion and often extremely low dissolved oxygen concentra-
tions. The entire ecosystem began to collapse. This prob-
lem, coupled with pollution and irrational exploitation of 
fish stocks, started a sharp decline in fisheries resources.] 
RELEVANCE: Matches on all elements found in goalframe  
Figure 4: A HITIQA generated data frame.  Words in 
bold were used to fill the Frame. 
 
     The data frames are then compared to the Goal 
Frame. We pay particular attention to matching the 
topic attributes, before any other attributes are con-
sidered. If there is an exact match between a Goal 
Frame topic and the text being used to build the 
data frame, then this becomes the data frame?s 
topic as well.  If more than one match is found, the 
subsequent matches become the sub-topics of the 
data frame. On the other hand, if no match is pos-
sible against the Goal Frame topic, we choose the 
topic from the list of the Wordnet generated hy-
pernyms. An example data frame generated from 
the text retrieved in response to the query about the 
Black Sea is shown in Figure 4. After the initial 
framing is done, frames judged to be related to the 
same concept or event, are merged together and 
values of their attributes are combined. 
 
7   Judging Frame Relevance 
We judge a particular data frame as relevant, and 
subsequently the corresponding segment of text as 
relevant, by comparison to the Goal Frame. The 
 data frames are scored based on the number of 
conflicts found between them and the Goal Frame. 
The conflicts are mismatches on values of corre-
sponding attributes. If a data frame is found to 
have no conflicts, it is given the highest relevance 
rank, and a conflict score of zero.  All other data 
frames are scored with an incrementing conflict 
value, one for frames with one conflict with the 
Goal Frame, two for two conflicts etc.  Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the query are 
given a score of 99 indicating the lowest relevancy 
rank.  Currently, frames with a conflict score of 99  
are excluded from further processing. The frame in 
Figure 4 is scored as fully relevant to the question 
(0 conflicts). 
 
8   Enabling Dialogue with the User 
Framed information allows HITIQA to automati-
cally judge some text as relevant and to conduct a 
meaningful dialogue with the user as needed on 
other text. The purpose of the dialogue is to help 
the user to navigate the answer space and to solicit 
from the user more details as to what information 
he or she is seeking. The main principle here is that 
the dialogue is at the information semantic level, 
not at the information organization level. Thus, it is 
okay to ask the user whether information about the 
AIDS conference in Cape Town should be in-
cluded in the answer to a question about combating 
AIDS in Africa. However, the user should never be 
asked if a particular keyword is useful or not, or if 
a document is relevant or not. We have developed 
a 3-pronged strategy: 
1. Narrowing dialogue: ask questions that 
would allow the system to reduce the size 
of the answer set.  
2. Expanding dialogue: ask questions that 
would allow the system to decide if the an-
swer set needs to be expanded by informa-
tion just outside of it (near-misses). 
3. Fact seeking dialogue: allow the user to 
ask questions seeking additional facts and 
specific examples, or similar situations. 
Of the above, we have thus far implemented the 
first two options as part of the preliminary clarifi-
cation dialogue. The clarification dialogue is when 
the user and the system negotiate the task that 
needs to be performed. We can call this a ?triaging 
stage?, as opposed to the actual problem solving 
stage (point 3 above). In practice, these two stages 
are not necessarily separated and may be overlap-
ping throughout the entire interaction. Nonetheless, 
these two have decidedly distinct character and 
require different dialogue strategies on the part of 
the system. 
     Our approach to dialogue in HITIQA is mod-
eled to some degree upon the mixed-initiative dia-
logue management adopted in the AMITIES pro-
ject (Hardy et al, 2002b). The main advantage of 
the AMITIES model is its reliance on data-driven 
semantics which allows for spontaneous and mixed 
initiative dialogue to occur.  
     By contrast, the major approaches to implemen-
tation of dialogue systems to date rely on systems 
of functional transitions that make the resulting 
system much less flexible. In the grammar-based 
approach, which is prevalent in commercial sys-
tems, such as in various telephony products, as 
well as in practically oriented research prototypes5, 
(e.g., DARPA, 2002; Seneff and Polifoni, 2000; 
Ferguson and Allen, 1998) a complete dialogue 
transition graph is designed to guide the conversa-
tion and predict user responses, which is suitable 
for closed domains only. In the statistical variation 
of this approach, a transition graph is derived from 
a large body of annotated conversations (e.g., 
Walker, 2000; Litman and Pan, 2002). This latter 
approach is facilitated through a dialogue annota-
tion process, e.g., using Dialogue Act Markup in 
Several Layers (DAMSL) (Allen and Core, 1997), 
which is a system of functional dialogue acts.  
     Nonetheless, an efficient, spontaneous dialogue 
cannot be designed on a purely functional layer. 
Therefore, here we are primarily interested in the 
semantic layer, that is, the information exchange 
and information building effects of a conversation. 
In order to properly understand a dialogue, both 
semantic and functional layers need to be consid-
ered. In this paper we are concentrating exclusively 
on the semantic layer. 
 
9   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space. Depending upon the 
size of this set and the presence of other frames 
outside of it, the system either proceeds to generate 
the answer or initiates a dialogue with the user. For 
                                                 
5 A notable exception is CU Communicator developed 
at University of Colorado (Ward and Pellom, 1999) 
 example, if the answer space appears too large or 
varied, e.g. consists of many different topics, the 
system may ask the user how to narrow it. Alterna-
tively, the presence of large groups of texts frames 
with near-miss frames assigned to them (i.e., 
frames with 1 or 2 conflicts with the Goal Frame) 
may indicate that the answer space is actually lar-
ger, and the user will be consulted about a  possi-
ble broadening of the question. Currently, we only 
initiate a clarification dialogue for 1-conflict 
frames.  
     A 1-conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal Frame. This could be a 
mismatch on any attribute, for example, LOCA-
TION, or ORGANIZATION, or TIME, etc. A special 
case arises when the conflict occurs on the TOPIC 
attribute.  Since all other attributes match, we may 
be looking at potentially different events or situa-
tions involving the same entities, or occurring at 
the same location or time. The purpose of the clari-
fication dialogue in this case is to probe which of 
these topics may be of interest to the user.  This is 
illustrated in the exchange below recorded during 
an evaluation session with an intelligence analyst: 
 
User: ?Who is Elizardo Sanchez?? 
HITIQA: ?Are you interested in seeing information 
about civil rights as it is related to Elizardo Sanchez? 
 
ONE-CONFLICT FRAME 
TOPIC: civil_rights  
SUB-TOPIC: []  
LOCATION: [Cuba, Cuba, Cuba]  
COMPANIES: []  
PEOPLE: [Sanchez, Sanchez]  
DOCUMENT DATE: [2000, 1, 11]  
SOURCE: HAVANA (AP) ?  
TEXT: [``I consider that the situation for civil and political 
rights in Cuba has worsened over the past year... owing to 
that Cuba continues to be the only closed society in this hemi-
sphere,'' Sanchez said. ``There have been no significant re-
lease of prisoners, the number of people sanctioned or proc-
essed for political motives increased. Sanchez, who himself 
spent many years in Cuban prisons, is among the communist 
island's best known opposition activists. The commission he 
heads issues a report on civil rights every six months, along 
with a list of people it considers to be imprisoned for political 
motives. ] 
Figure 5: One of the Frames that were used in generat-
ing Sanchez  dialogue.  Words in bold were used to fill 
the Frame. 
 
    In order to understand what happened here, we 
need to note first that the Goal Frame for the user 
question does not have any specific value assigned 
to its TOPIC attribute. This of course is as we would 
expect it: the question does not give us a hint as to 
what information we need to look for or may be 
hoping to find about Sanchez. This also means that 
all the text frames obtained from the retrieved set 
for this question will have at least one conflict, 
near-misses. One such text frame is shown in Fig-
ure 5: its topic is ?civil rights? and it about San-
chez. HITIQA thus asks if ?civil rights? is a topic 
of interest to the user. If the user responds posi-
tively, this topic will be added to the answer space.    
     The above dialogue strategy is applicable to 
other attribute mismatch cases, and produces intel-
ligent-sounding responses from the system. During 
the dialogue, as new information is obtained from 
the user, the Goal Frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated. The system 
may interpret the new information as a positive or 
negative. Positives are added to the Goal Frame. 
Negatives are stored in a Negative-Goal Frame and 
will also be used in the re-scoring of the data 
frames, possibly causing conflict scores to in-
crease. The Negative-Goal Frame is created when 
HITIQA receives a negative response from the 
user. The Negative-Goal Frame includes informa-
tion that HITIQA has identified as being of no in-
terest to the user.  If the user responds the equiva-
lent of ?yes? to the system clarification question  in 
the Sanchez dialogue, civil_rights will be added to 
the topic list in the Goal Frame and all one-conflict 
frames with a civil_rights topic will be re-scored to 
Zero conflicts, two-conflict frames with 
civil_rights as a topic will be rescored to one, etc.  
If the user responds ?no?, the Negative-Goal 
Frame will be generated and all frames with 
civil_rights as a topic will be rescored to 99 in or-
der to remove them from further processing. 
     The clarification dialogue will continue on the 
topic level until all the significant sets of NEAR-
MISS frames are either included in the answer 
space (through user broadening the scope of the 
question that removes the initial conflicts) or dis-
missed as not relevant. When HITIQA reaches this 
point it will re-evaluate the data frames in its an-
swer space.  If there are too many answer frames 
now (more than a pre-determined upper threshold), 
the dialogue manager will offer to the user to nar-
row the question using another frame attribute. If 
the size of the new answer space is still too small 
(i.e., there are many unresolved near-miss  frames), 
 the dialogue manager will suggest to the user ways 
of further broadening the question, thus making 
more data frames relevant, or possibly retrieving 
new documents by adding terms acquired through  
the clarification dialogue.  When the number of 
frames is within the acceptable range, HITIQA will 
generate the answer using the text from the frames 
in the current answer space.  The user may end the 
dialogue at any point and have an answer gener-
ated given the current state of the frames. 
 
9.1   Narrowing Dialogue 
HITIQA attempts to reduce the number of frames 
judged to be relevant through a Narrowing Dia-
logue. This is done when the answer space con-
tains too many elements to form a succinct answer. 
This typically happens when the initial question 
turns out to be too vague or unspecific, with re-
spect to the available data. 
 
9.2   Broadening Dialogue 
As explained before, the system may attempt to 
increase the number of frames judged relevant 
through a Broadening Dialogue (BD), whenever 
the answer space appears too narrow, i.e., contains 
too few zero-conflict frames.  We are conducting 
further experiments to define this situation more 
precisely. Currently, the BD will only occur if 
there are one-conflict frames, or near misses. 
Broadening questions can be asked about any of 
the attributes which have values in the Goal Frame. 
 
10   Answer Generation 
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text 
passages from the zero conflict frames. The text of 
these frames are ordered by date and outputted to 
the user.  Typically the answer to these analytical 
type questions will require many pages of informa-
tion.  Example 1 below shows the first portion of 
the answer generated by HITIQA for the Black Sea 
query. Current work is focusing on answer genera-
tion. 
 
2002:  
The Black Sea is widely recognized as one of the re-
gional seas most damaged by human activity. Almost 
one third of the entire land area of continental Europe 
drains into this sea? major European rivers, the Da-
nube, Dnieper and Don, discharge into this sea while its 
only connection to the world's oceans is the narrow 
Bosphorus Strait. The Bosphorus is as little as 70 me-
ters deep and 700 meters wide but the depth of the 
Black Sea itself exceeds two kilometers in places. Con-
taminants and nutrients enter the Black Sea via river 
run-off mainly and by direct discharge from land-based 
sources. The management of the Black Sea itself is the 
shared responsibility of the six coastal countries: Bul-
garia, Georgia, Romania, Russian Federation, Turkey, 
and Ukraine? 
Example 1: Partial answer generated by HITIQA to the 
Black Sea query. 
 
11   Evaluations 
We have just completed the first round of a pilot 
evaluation for testing the interactive dialogue com-
ponent of HITIQA. The purpose of this first stage 
of evaluation is to determine what kind of dialogue 
is acceptable/tolerable to the user and whether an 
efficient navigation though the answer space is 
possible.  HITIQA was blindly tested by two dif-
ferent analysts on eleven different topics.  Five 
different groups participated, but no analyst tested 
more than one system, as system comparison was 
not a goal.  The analysts were given complete free-
dom in forming their queries and responses to 
HITIQA?s questions.  They were only provided 
with descriptions of the eleven topics the systems 
would be tested on.  The analysts were given 15 
minutes for each topic to arrive at what they be-
lieved to be an acceptable answer. During testing a 
Wizard (human) was allowed to intervene if 
HITIQA generated a dialogue question/response 
that was felt inappropriate. The Wizard was able to 
override the system and send a Wizard generated 
question/response to the analyst.  The HITIQA 
Wizard intervened an average of 13% of the time. 
     These results are for information purposes only 
as it was not a formal evaluation.  HITIQA earned 
an average score of 5.8 from both Analysts for dia-
logue, where 1 was ?extremely dissatisfied? and 7 
was ?completely satisfied?.  The highest score pos-
sible was a 7 for each dialogue.  The Analysts were 
asked to grade each scenario for success or failure.  
We divide the failures from both analysts into three 
categories: 
1) the user gives up on the system for the 
given scenario(9%) 
2) the 15 minute time limit was up(13%) 
3) the data was not in the database(9%) 
HITIQA had a 63% success rate for Analyst 1 and 
a 73% success rate for Analyst 2. It is unclear how 
 these results should be interpreted, if at all, as the 
evaluation was a mere pilot, mostly to test the me-
chanics of the setup. We know only that a human 
Wizard equipped with all necessary information 
can easily achieve 100% success in this test. What 
is still needed is a baseline performance, perhaps 
based on using an ordinary keyword-based search 
engine.  
12   Future Work 
This paper describes a work in progress. We ex-
pect that the initial specification of content frame 
will evolve as we subject the initial system to more 
demanding evaluations. Currently, the frames are 
not topically specialized, and this appears the most 
logical next refinement, i.e., develop several (10-
30) types of frames covering different classes of 
events, from politics to medicine to science to in-
ternational economics, etc. This is expected to in-
crease the accuracy of the dialogue as is the inter-
active visualization which is also under develop-
ment. Answer generation will involve fusion of 
information on the frame level, and is currently in 
an initial phase of implementation.

Abstract 
In this paper we describe some preliminary 
results of qualitative evaluation of the answer-
ing system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive 
Question Answering) which has been devel-
oped over the last 2 years as an advanced re-
search tool for information analysts. HITIQA 
is an interactive open-domain question an-
swering technology designed to allow analysts 
to pose complex exploratory questions in natu-
ral language and obtain relevant information 
units to prepare their briefing reports in order 
to satisfy a given scenario. The system uses 
novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clari-
fication dialogue with the user that explores 
the scope and the context of the desired answer 
space. The system has undergone extensive 
hands-on evaluations by a group of intelli-
gence analysts representing various foreign in-
telligence services. This evaluation validated 
the overall approach in HITIQA but also ex-
posed limitations of the current prototype.  
1   Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as ?What 
has been Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kos-
ovo?? The distinguishing property of such questions is 
that one cannot generally anticipate what might consti-
tute the answer. While certain types of things may be 
expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is 
heavily conditioned by what information is in fact avail-
able on the topic, background knowledge of the user, 
context in the scenario, intended audience, etc. From a 
practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often un-
derspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of pos-
sible answers. Therefore, clarification dialogue is often 
needed to negotiate with the user the exact scope and 
intent of the question, and clarify whether similar topics 
found might also be of interest to the user in order to 
complete their scenario report. This paper will present 
results from a series of evaluations conducted in a series 
of workshops with the intended end users of HITIQA 
(professional intelligence analysts) using the system to 
solve realistic analytic problems. 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in the 
state of the art of automated question answering.  In this 
paper we focus on our approach to analytical question 
answering in order to produce a report in response to a 
given scenario.  We also report on the user evaluations 
we conducted and their results with respect to our 
unique approach. 
2   Analytical QA Scenarios 
Analytical scenarios are information task directives 
assigned to analysts to support a larger foreign policy 
process. Scenarios thus contain the information need 
specifications at various levels of detail,  the type, for-
mat and timing of the response required (an intelligence 
report) as well as the primary recipient of the report 
(e.g., the Secretary of State). A hypothetical, but realis-
tic scenario is shown in Figure 1 below. This scenario, 
along with several others like it, was used in evaluating 
 HITIQA performance and fitness for supporting the 
analytical process.  
As can be readily assessed from the directives in 
Figure 1, scenarios are not merely tough questions; they 
are far too complex to be considered as a single question 
at all. It is equally clear that no simple answer can be 
expected and that preparing a report would mean find-
ing answers to a series of interlocking questions or vari-
ous granularities.  
 
Scenario: The al-Qaida Terrorist Group 
 
As an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, your pro-
fession entails knowledge of the al-Qaida terrorist group.  
Your division chief has ordered a detailed report on the al-
Qaida Terrorist Group due in three weeks. Provide as much 
information as possible on this militant organization. Eventu-
ally, this report should present information regarding the most 
essential concerns, including who are the key figures involved 
with al-Qaida along with other organizations, countries, and 
members that are affiliated, any trades that al-Qaida has made 
with organizations or countries, what facilities they possess, 
where they receive their financial support, what capabilities 
they have (CBW program, other weapons, etc.) and how have 
they acquired them, what is their possible future activity, how 
their training program operates, who their new members are. 
Also, include any other relevant information to your report as 
you see fit.  
 FIGURE 1: Scenario used during user evaluations 
  
We have organized a series of usability evaluations 
with active duty intelligence analysts to find out how 
they approach the problem of solving a scenario. The 
prerequisites for this were are follows: 
1. A robust, broadly functional analytical QA sys-
tem capable of sustaining realistic analytic 
tasks. 
2. A realistic corpus of ?raw intelligence? in form 
of varying quality and verity new-like reports. 
3. A set of realistic, average complexity analytic 
tasks or scenarios to be used. 
HITIQA has been developed over the past two years as 
an open-ended highly flexible interactive QA system to 
allow just this type of evaluation. The system supports a 
variety of information gathering functions without 
straight jacketing the user into any particular mode or 
interaction style. The system does not produce cut and 
dry ?answers?; instead it allows the analysts to build the 
answers the way they want them. While this open-
endedness may seem like unfinished business, we be-
lieve that further development must take into account 
the needs of analysts if they were ever to adopt this 
technology in their work. 
Our main hypothesis is that analysts employ a range 
of strategies to find the required information and that 
these strategies depend significantly upon the nature of 
the task and the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. Our experience with interactive systems also indi-
cated that real users are unlikely to follow any single 
information exploration strategy, but instead would use 
multiple, parallel, even overlapping approaches in order 
to maximize the returns and their confidence in the re-
sults. As a corollary we may expect that the scenario 
tasks are unlikely to be systematically decomposed into 
a series of smaller tasks ahead of actual search. In other 
words, the analytical process is a dialogue, not a se-
quence of commands. Moreover, questions actually 
submitted to the system during the analytical process 
seldom seek just the exact answer, instead they are often 
considered as ?light beams? through the data: focusing 
on the answer but also illuminating adjacent, related 
information which may prove just as valuable.  
AFRL, NIST, CNS and ARDA collaborated in the 
development of scenarios used in our evaluation ses-
sions.  
3   Data Driven Semantics of Questions 
When the user poses a question to a system having 
access to a huge database of unstructured data (text 
files), we need to first reduce the big pile to perhaps a 
handful of documents where the answer is likely to be 
found. The easiest way to do it is to convert the question 
into a search query (by removing stopwords and stem-
ming and tokenizing other words) and submitting this 
query to a fast but non-exact document retrieval system, 
e.g.,   Smart (Buckley, 1985) or InQuery (Callan et al, 
1992), or if you are on the web, Google, etc.   
In the current prototype of HITIQA, we use a com-
bination of Google and InQuery to retrieve the top 50 to 
200 documents from a large document database, con-
sisting of several smaller collections such as newspaper 
stories, documents from the Center of Nonproliferation 
Studies, as well as web mined files.  The retrieved 
documents are then broken down into passages, mostly 
exploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of 
the original sources. 
The set of text passages returned from the initial 
search is the first (very crude) approximation of the An-
swer Space for the user?s first question. In order to de-
termine what this answer space consists of we perform 
automatic analysis (a combination of hierarchical clus-
tering and classification) to uncover if what we got is a 
fairly homogenous collection (i.e., all texts have very 
similar content), or whether there are a number of di-
verse topics or aspects represented in there, somehow 
tied together by a common thread. In the former case, 
we may be reasonably confident that we have the an-
swer, modulo the retrievable information. In the latter 
case, we know that the question is more complex than 
the user may have intended, and a negotiation process is 
needed to clarify topics of interest for the scenario re-
port. 
 The next step is to measure how well each of the as-
pects within the answer space is ?matching up? against 
the original question. This is accomplished through the 
framing process described later in this paper. The out-
come of the framing process is twofold: first, the alter-
native interpretations of the question are ranked within 3 
broad categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers. 
Second, salient concepts and attributes for each topi-
cal/aspectual group are extracted into topic frames. This 
enables the system to conduct a meaningful dialogue 
with the user, a dialogue which is wholly content ori-
ented, and entirely data driven.  
4   Partial structuring of text data 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to de-
lineate the gap between the meaning of the user?s ques-
tion and the system ?understanding? of this question. 
The framing is an attempt to impose a partial structure 
on the text that would allow the system to systemati-
cally compare different text pieces against each other 
and against the question, and also to communicate with 
the user about this. In particular, the framing process 
may uncover topics or aspects within the answer space 
which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus 
may be unaware of their existence.  This approach is 
particularly beneficial to the needs of the scenario prob-
lem, where these similar aspects frequently are needed 
in completely ?answering? the scenario, with the sce-
nario report.   
In the current version of HITIQA, frames are pre-
defined structures representing various event types. We 
started with the General frame, which can represent any 
event or relation involving any number of entities such 
as people, locations, organizations, time, and so forth.  
In a specialized domain, or if the user interests are 
known to be limited to a particular set of topics, we de-
fine domain-specific frames. Current HITIQA prototype 
has three broad domain-specific frames, related to the 
Weapon of Mass Destruction proliferation domain 
(which was one of the domains of interest to our users). 
These frames are: WMDTransfer, WMDDevelop, 
WMDTreaty, and of course we keep the General frame.  
Obviously, these three frames do not cover the domain 
represented by our data set; they merely capture the 
most commonly occurring types of events. All frames 
contain a small number of core attributes, such as LO-
CATION, PERSON, COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, ETC., which 
are extracted using BBN?s Identifinder software, which 
extracts 24 types of entities.  Domain-specific frames 
add event specific attributes, which may require extract-
ing additional items from text, or assigning roles to ex-
isting attributes, or both.  For example, WMDTransfer?s 
attributes TRANSFER_TO and TRANSFER_FROM define 
roles of some COUNTRY or ORGANIZATION, while the 
TRANSFER_TYPE attribute scans the text for keywords 
that may indicate the type of transfer, e.g., export, sale, 
etc.  
HITIQA creates a Goal frame for the user?s ques-
tion, which can be subsequently compared to the data 
frames obtained from retrieved data. A Goal frame can 
be a General frame or any of the domain specific frames 
available in HITIQA.  For example, the Goal frame 
generated from the question, ?Where does al-Qaida 
have training facilities?? is a General frame as shown in 
Figure 2.  This was the first question generated by one 
of our analysts during the first evaluation while working 
on the al-Qaida scenario shown in Figure 1.

RELEVANCE:  Conflict: [Topic] 
FIGURE 3: A HITIQA generated data frame and the un-
derlying text passage. Words in bold were used to fill the 
Frame.   
 
HTIQA automatically judges a particular data frame 
as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding seg-
ment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal 
frame. The data frames are scored based on the number 
of conflicts found between them and the Goal frame. 
The conflicts are mismatches on values of correspond-
ing attributes. If a data frame is found to have no con-
flicts, it is given the highest relevance rank, and a con-
flict score of zero.  All other data frames are scored with 
 a decreasing value based on the number of conflicts, 
negative one for frames with one conflict with the Goal 
frame, negative two for two conflicts etc.  Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the question are 
given a score of -99 indicating the lowest relevancy 
rank.  Currently, frames with a conflict score of -99 are 
excluded from further processing as outliers. The frame 
in Figure 2 is scored as a near miss and will generate 
dialogue, where the user will decide whether or not it 
should be included in the answer space. 
5   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space. Depending upon the pres-
ence of other frames outside of this set, the system ei-
ther proceeds to generate the answer or initiates a dia-
logue with the user.  HITIQA begins asking the user 
questions on these near-miss frame groups, with the 
largest group first.  The groups must be at least groups 
of size N, where N is a user controlled setting.  This 
setting restricts all of HITIQA?s generated dialogue.   
A one conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal frame. This could be a mis-
match on any of the General attributes, for example, 
LOCATION, or ORGANIZATION, or TIME, etc., or in one of 
the domain specific attributes, TRANSFER_TO, or TRANS-
FER_TYPE, etc.  A special case arises when the conflict 
occurs on the TOPIC attribute.  Since all other attributes 
match, we may be looking at potentially different events 
or situations involving the same entities, or occurring at 
the same location or time. The purpose of the clarifica-
tion dialogue in this case is to probe which of these top-
ics may be of interest to the user.  Another special case 
arises when the Goal frame is of a different type than a 
data frame.  The purpose of the clarification dialogue in 
this case is to expand the user?s answer space into a 
different but possibly related event.  A combination of 
both of these cases is illustrated in the exchange in Fig-
ure 4 below.   
User: ?Where does al-Qaida have training facili-
ties?? 
HITIQA: ?Do you want to see material on the trans-
fer of weapons and intelligence to al-Qaida?? 
FIGURE 4: Dialogue generated by HITIQA for the al-Qaida 
training facilities question 
 
In order to understand what happened here, we need 
to note first that the Goal frame for this example is a 
General Frame, from Figure 2.  One of the data frames 
that caused this dialogue to be generated is shown in 
Figure 3 above.  While this frame is of a different frame 
type than the Goal frame, namely WMD Transfer, it 
matches on all of the General attributes except TOPIC, so 
HITIQA asks the user if they would like to expand their 
answer space to this other domain, namely to include 
the transfer of weapons involving this organization as 
well.

FIGURE 5: Partial answer generated by HITIQA to the al-
Qaida training facilities question 
 
During the dialogue, as new information is obtained 
from the user, the Goal frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated. The system may 
interpret the new information as a positive or negative. 
Positives are added to the Goal frame. Negatives are 
stored in a Negative-Goal frame and will also be used in 
the re-scoring of the data frames, possibly causing con-
flict scores to increase. If the user responds the equiva-
lent of ?yes? to the system clarification question in Fig-
ure 4, a corresponding WMD Transfer frame would be 
added to the Goal frame and all WMD Transfer frames 
will be re-scored.  If the user responds ?no?, the Nega-
tive-Goal frame will be generated and all WMD Trans-
fer frames will be rescored to 99 in order to remove 
them from further processing.  The user may end the 
dialogue, at any point and have an answer generated 
given the current state of the frames.   
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text 
passages from the zero conflict frames. In addition, 
HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for the text passages 
in all the Frames in the answer space.  This is done us-
ing grammar rules and the attributes of a frame.  Figure 
 5 shows a portion of the answer generated by HITIQA 
for the al-Qaida training facilities question. 
 
6   HITIQA Interface 
There are two distinct ways for the user to interact 
with HITIQA to explore their answer space.  The An-
swer Panel displays the user?s current answer at any 
given time during the interaction for a single question.  
Through this panel the user can read the paragraphs that 
are currently in their answer.  There are links on this 
panel so the user is able to view the full original source 
document from which the passage(s) were extracted. 
 The Visual panel offers the user an alternative to 
reading text by providing a tool for visually browsing 
the entire answer space.  Figure 6 shows a typical view 
of the visualization panel. The spheres are representa-
tive of single frames and groups of frames.  The user?s 
attention may be drawn to particular frames by the color 
coding or the attribute spikes.  The colors represent the 
frame?s score, so the user can quickly see what is in 
their answer, blue, and what is not, all other colors.  The 
attribute spikes may also be used as a navigation tool.  
The active attribute is chosen by the user through radio 
buttons. The current active attribute in Figure 6, is Lo-
cation.  This displays all instances of locations men-
tioned in the corresponding text. 
 
 
        Figure 6: Frame Level Display 
 
The underlying text that was used to build the frame 
may be displayed in the lower right hand window.  In 
this text display window there is a hyperlink that takes 
the user directly to the full source document. The user is 
able to interact with this panel by adding and removing 
information from their generated answer. Moving from 
the visualization to the textual dialogue, the generated 
answer, and back is seamless in a sense that any 
changes to the frame scores in one modality are imme-
diately accessible to the user in another modality. Users 
can add and remove frames from the answer space and 
HITIQA will always seamlessly pickup a new dialogue 
or generate a new answer.  
 
7   HITIQA Qualitative Evaluations 
In order to assess our progress thus far, and to also 
develop metrics to guide future evaluation, we invited a 
group of analysts employed by the US government to 
participate in two three-day workshops held in Septem-
ber and October 2003.  
The two basic objectives of the workshops were: 
1. To perform a realistic assessment of the useful-
ness and usability of HITIQA as an end-to-end system, 
from the information seeker's initial questions to com-
pletion of a draft report.  
2. To develop metrics to compare the answers ob-
tained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of 
the support that HITIQA provides.     
Each of these objectives entails a particular chal-
lenge. Performing a realistic assessment of HITIQA is 
difficult because many of the resources that the analysts 
use, as well as the reports they produce, are classified 
and therefore inaccessible to researchers.  
Assessing the quality of the support that the system 
provides is not easy because analytical questions rarely 
have a single right answer. It is not obvious how to de-
fine, for example, the precision of the system. We there-
fore conducted an 'information unit' exercise, whose 
purpose was to determine whether the analysts could 
identify information building blocks in their reports, so 
that we could compare and contrast different reports.  
To obtain an adequate supply of appropriate text 
data to support extensive question answering sessions 
(1, 2, 3 and 4 hours long), we prepared a new corpus of 
approximately 1.2 Gbytes. This new corpus consists of 
the reports from the Center for Non-Proliferation Stud-
ies (CNS) collected for the AQUAINT Program, aug-
mented with a much larger collection of texts on similar 
subject matter mined from the web using Google1. The 
final corpus proved to be sufficient to support about 
three hours of use of HITIQA to ?solve? each of the 
scenarios. 
The first day of the first workshop was devoted to 
training, including a two-part proficiency test. HITIQA 
is a fairly complex system, that includes multiple layers 
of data processing and user interaction, and it was criti-
cal that the users are sufficiently ?fluent? if we were to 
measure their productivity. The analysts' primary task 
on the second day was preparation of reports in re-
sponse to the scenarios. 
                                                 
1 Google has kindly agreed to temporarily extend our 
usage license so we could collect the data over a short 
time. 
  The third day was devoted to quantitative and quali-
tative evaluation, discussed later. In addition, we asked 
the analysts to score each others reports, as well as to 
identify key information units in them. These informa-
tion units could be later compared across different re-
ports in order to determine their completeness.  
8   Workshop Results 
The results of the quantitative evaluations strongly vali-
date the approach that we have taken. These conclusions 
are confirmed by analysts comments gleaned both from 
the formal qualitative assessment and from informal 
discussion. As one analyst said, ?the system as it stands 
now, in my mind, gave me enough information to try to 
put together a 80% solution but ?I don't think you're 
ever gonna reach that 100% state.? At the same time, we 
learned a great deal about how analysts work. 
It is important to determine the realism of the sce-
narios used during the workshop relative to the analysts? 
current work tasks in order for any results to be mean-
ingful. Each analyst was asked a series of five questions 
such as, ?How realistic was the scenario?  In other 
words did it resemble tasks you could imagine perform-
ing at work?? These 5 questions were all relative to the 
realism and difficulty of the scenario tasks.  Analysts 
used a scale of 1 to 5 based on their agreement with the 
statements, where 5 was complete agreement.  Our 
mean score was 3.84, indicating our scenarios were real-
istic and of about average difficulty when compared to 
the work they normally perform.   
We have classified the type of passages that an ana-
lyst copied to their report into two categories, answer 
passages and additional information passages, see Fig-
ure 7 below.  The answer passages either exactly an-
swered the user?s initial question or supplied supporting 
information.  The additional passages do not answer the 
original question posed, but may have been added to the 
answer through dialogue, or through the user?s explora-
tion of document links offered.  This could be a piece of 
information needed to satisfy some other aspect of the 
scenario that they had not asked about yet, or possibly a 
topic the user had not even considered but found rele-
vant when it was presented to them. As can be seen 
there was a very large amount of ?additional? informa-
tion that the user copied to their report.  The amounts 
reported here are the averages for all of the analysts for 
both workshops.  This supports our hypothesis that ana-
lysts seldom seek just the exact answer, but they are 
also looking at adjacent, related information, much of 
which they retain for their report.  Note that there were a 
small number of passages that contained a combination 
of answer and additional information; these were added 
to answer.

Figure 8: Number of Passages Copied Vs. Those Viewed 
 
We should now establish the number of passages 
copied versus those viewed, relative to links and the 
answer.  Figure 8 above shows the total number of pas-
sages copied versus the total number of passages 
viewed.  It is seen that many more passages need to be 
viewed through full document links before a useful pas-
sage is found.  In comparison a much smaller number of 
answer passages need to be viewed from the Answer 
panel in order to find useful passages.   
All of the analysts? sessions were recorded using 
Camtasia.  Figure 9 shows an annotation created for a 
typical session.  Analysts were observed to utilize a 
range of varying strategies as they worked different 
scenarios and even while working different queries of 
the same scenario.  Figure 10 shows the statistics for 
each Analyst?s use of HITIQA while working on the 
scenarios during the two workshops (note that Analyst-4 
was only able to attend the first workshop and Analyst-1 
did not create a report for Scenario 2).  Some of the 
variations in strategies among the analysts while work-
ing the same scenario are quite striking.  For example, 
Scenario 4 was  worked quite  differently  by  Analyst-1  
 versus Analyst-2.  While Analyst-1 spent almost all of 
his/her  time in  the Visual Panel, Analyst-2 spent virtu-
ally all of his/her time in the Answer panel.  Analyst-1 
produced his/her report copying 52 paragraphs while 
Analyst 2 copied only 35.  There are also large varia-
tions in the number of questions asked for the same sce-
nario.  Examine scenario 5, where Analyst-3 asked a 
total of 11 questions and Analyst-2 only needed to ask 2 
questions.  Relative to this, Analyst-3, who asked a 
much larger number of questions, copied only 28 pas-
sages, whereas Analyst-2 copied 31.  These variations, 
as stated earlier in the paper, could be due to the nature 
of the task, the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. For example, the difference in the number of 
questions asked between Analyst-2 and Analyst-3 for 
scenario 5 may be due to difference in search strategies 
employed, but may also reflect the amount of back-
ground knowledge of the topic.

There is, however, some consistency across the ana-
lysts in the amount of information retained per scenario. 
The charts are drawn in logarithmic scale, but it should 
be visible that scenarios 2 and 3 produced less interac-
tion and required less information to fulfill than scenar-
ios 4 and 5. It is also visible that scenario 1 required 
more questions to be asked and more exploration to be 
done in visual panel than other scenarios. 
Finally, it is important to provide some metric re-
garding the user?s overall satisfaction with their use of 
HITIQA.  At the end of each workshop Analysts were 
given a series of 17 questions, such as ?HITIQA helps 
me find important information?, shown in Figure 11, to 
assess their overall experience with the system.  Many 
of these questions were designed for the user to com-
pare HITIQA to the current tools they are using for this 
type of task.   Analysts again used a scale of 1 to 5 
based on their agreement with the statements.  The re-
sults were then converted, where 5 would always denote 
the best, and are shown in Figure 11 below.  It is impor-
tant to note that we scored highly overall, but addition-
ally we scored highly in the majority of questions rela-
tive to comparison of their current tools.  For example, 
for Question 14: ?Having HITIQA at work would help 
me find information faster than I can currently find it?, 
our mean score was 3.83.

In summary, the results from these two evaluations 
indicate that HITIQA, in its current state, is already 
competitive with the tools that the analysts are currently 
using in their work, supporting our overall approach to 
Analytical Question Answering.  HTIQA provides the 
user with a tool to find the passages needed to complete 
a report for a given scenario.  While working on a sce-
nario HITIQA has been shown to provide information 
which exactly answers the user?s question, and addi-
tionally HITIQA?s method brings to light other related 
information that the analyst retains in order to complete 
their report.
