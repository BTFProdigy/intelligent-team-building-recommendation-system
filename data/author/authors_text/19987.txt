Abstract 
While discussing a concrete controversial topic, most humans will find it challenging to swiftly raise a 
diverse set of convincing and relevant claims that should set the basis of their arguments. Here, we dem-
onstrate the initial capabilities of a system that, given a controversial topic, can automatically pinpoint 
relevant claims in Wikipedia, determine their polarity with respect to the given topic, and articulate them 
per the user's request. 
1 Introduction 
The ability to argue in a persuasive manner is an important aspect of human interaction that naturally 
arises in various domains such as politics, marketing, law, and health-care. Furthermore, good decision 
making relies on the quality of the arguments being presented and the process by which they are re-
solved. Thus, it is not surprising that argumentation has long been a topic of interest in academic re-
search, and different models have been proposed to capture the notion of an argument (Freeley and 
Steinberg, 2008). 
A fundamental component which is common to all these models is the concept of claim (or conclu-
sion). Specifically, at the heart of every argument lies a single claim, which is the assertion the argu-
ment aims to prove. Given a concrete topic, or context, most humans will find it challenging to swiftly 
raise a diverse set of convincing and relevant claims that should set the basis of their arguments.

In this work we demonstrate the initial capabilities of a system that, given a controversial topic, can 
automatically pinpoint relevant claims in Wikipedia, determine their polarity with respect to the given 
topic, and articulate them per the user's request. 
 
2 Basic concepts and associated challenges 
We define and rely on the following two concepts:  
Topic: Short, usually controversial statement that defines the subject of interest.  
Context Dependent Claim (CDC): General, and concise statement, that directly supports or contests 
the given Topic. 
Given these definitions, as well as a few more detailed criteria to reduce the variability in the manu-
ally labeled data, human labelers were asked to detect CDCs for a diverse set of Topics, in relevant 
Wikipedia articles.  The collected data were used to train and assess the performance of the statistical 
models that underlie our system. These data are freely available for academic research (Aharoni et al 
2014). 
The distinction between a CDC and other related texts can be quite subtle, as illustrated in Table 1.  
For example, automatically distinguishing a CDC like S1 from a statement that simply defines a rele-
vant concept like S4, from a claim which is not relevant enough to the given Topic like S5, from a 
statement like S6 that merely repeats the given Topic in different words, or from a statement that repre-
sents a relevant claim which is not general enough like S7, is clearly challenging. Further, CDCs can 
be of different flavors, ranging from factual assertions like S1 to statements that are more of a matter of 
opinion (Pang and Lee 2008) like S2, adding to the complexity of the task. Moreover, our data suggest 
that even if one focuses on Wikipedia articles that are highly relevant to the given Topic, only ?2% of 
their sentences include CDCs.  
Furthermore, since CDCs are by definition concise statements, they typically do not span entire 
Wikipedia sentences but rather sub-sentences. This is illustrated in Table 2. There are many optional 
boundaries to consider when trying to identify the exact boundaries of a CDC within a typical Wikipe-
dia sentence. This task further complicates the CDC detection problem. Thus, we are faced with a large 
number of candidate CDCs, of which only a tiny fraction represents positive examples that might be 
quite reminiscent of some of the negative examples. Finally, automatically determining the correct 
Pro/Con polarity of a candidate CDC with respect to the Topic poses additional unique challenges. 
Nonetheless, by breaking the problem into a set of modular tangible problems and by employing vari-
ous techniques - specifically designed to the problems at hand - we obtain promising results, demon-
strated by the capabilities of our system. 
 
Topic The sale of violent video games to minors should be banned 
(Pro) CDC S1: Violent video games can increase children?s aggression 
(Pro) CDC S2: Video game publishers unethically train children in the use of weapons 
Note, that a valid CDC is not necessarily factual.  
(Con) CDC S3: Violent games affect children positively 
Invalid 
CDC 1 
S4: Video game addiction is excessive or compulsive use of computer and video games 
that interferes with daily life. 
This statement defines a concept relevant to the Topic, not a relevant claim.  
Invalid 
CDC 2 
S5: Violent TV shows just mirror the violence that goes on in the real world.  
This statement is not relevant enough to the Topic. 
Invalid 
CDC 3 
S6: Violent video games should not be sold to children. 
This statement simply repeats the Topic, and thus is not considered a valid CDC.  
Invalid 
CDC 4 
S7: ?Doom? has been blamed for nationally covered school shooting. 
This statement is not general enough to represent a CDC, as it focuses on a specific 
single video game. 
Table 1. Examples of CDCs and invalid CDCs.

Because violence in video games is interactive and not passive, critics such as Dave Grossman and 
Jack Thompson argue that violence in games  hardens children to unethical acts, calling first-person 
shooter games ``murder simulators'', although no conclusive evidence has supported this belief. 
Table 2. A CDC is often only a small part of a single Wikipedia sentence - e.g., the part marked in bold 
in this example. 
 
 
Figure 1. High level architecture of the demonstrated system. 
3 High Level Architecture 
The demonstrated system relies on a cascade of engines, depicted in Figure 1. In general, these engines 
rely on various IR, NLP and ML technologies, as well as different resources and lexicons like 
WordNet (Miller, 1995). Some engines are more mature than others, and, correspondingly, already 
employ a complex inner architecture, that will be discussed in more detail elsewhere. Given a Topic, 
the Topic Analysis engine starts with initial semantic analysis of the Topic, aiming to identify the 
main concepts mentioned in this Topic and the sentiment towards each concept. Next, the CDC 
Oriented Article Retrieval engine employs IR and opinion mining techniques in order to retrieve 
Wikipedia articles that with high probability contain CDCs. Next, the CDC Detection engine relies on 
a combination of NLP and ML techniques to zoom-in within the retrieved articles and detect candidate 
CDCs. A detailed description of this engine can be found in (Levy et al 2014). Next, the CDC 
Pro/Con engine aims to automatically determine the polarity of the candidate CDC with respect to the 
given Topic by analyzing and contrasting the sentiment towards key concepts mentioned in the Topic 
and within the candidate CDC. Next, the CDC Equivalence engine uses techniques reminiscent of 
automatic paraphrase detection to identify whether two candidate CDCs are semantically equivalent, so 
to avoid redundancy in the generated output. Finally, the CDC Refinement engine aims to improve 
the precision of the generated output, based on the results collected thus far; e.g., using a simple rule-
based approach, we remove candidate CDCs for which the predicted Pro/Con polarity has low 
confidence. The remaining predictions are sent to the Text To Speech engine that articulates the top 
CDC predictions at the user's request.    
4 Summary 
Given a Topic, the demonstrated system is currently focused on detecting and articulating relevant 
CDCs. Combining this system with technologies that could automatically detect evidence to support 
these CDCs, may give rise to a new generation of automatic argumentation systems. In principle, such 
systems may swiftly detect relevant CDCs in massive corpora, and support these CDCs with evidence 
detected within other articles, or even within entirely different corpora, ending up with automatically 
8
generated arguments that were never explicitly proposed before in this form by humans. The system 
described herein represents an important step in pursuing this vision.

Abstract 
We describe a novel and unique argumenta-
tive structure dataset. This corpus consists of 
data extracted from hundreds of Wikipedia ar-
ticles using a meticulously monitored manual 
annotation process. The result is 2,683 argu-
ment elements, collected in the context of 33 
controversial topics, organized  under a simple 
claim-evidence structure. The obtained data 
are publicly available for academic research.  
1 Introduction 
One major obstacle in developing automatic ar-
gumentation mining techniques is the scarcity of 
relevant high quality annotated data. Here, we 
describe a novel and unique benchmark data that 
relies on a simple argument model and elabo-
rates on the associated annotation process. Most 
importantly, the argumentative elements were 
gathered in the context of pre-defined controver-
sial topics, which distinguishes our work from 
other previous related corpora. 1  Two recent

? Corresponding author, at noams@il.ibm.com 
works that are currently under review [Rinott et 
al, Levy et al] have reported first results over 
different subsets of this data, which is now pub-
lically available for academic research upon re-
quest. We believe that this novel corpus should 
be of practical importance to many researches, 
and in particular to the emerging community of 
argumentation mining. 
Unlike the classical Toulmin model (Freeley 
and Steinberg 2008), we considered a simple and 
robust argument structure comprising only two 
components ? claim and associated supporting 
evidence. The argumentative structures were 
carefully annotated under a pre-defined topic, 
introduced as a debate motion. As the collected 
data covers a diverse set of 33 motions, we ex-
pect it could be used to develop generic tools for 
automatic detection and construction of argu-
mentative structures in the context of new topics.  
2 Data Model 
We defined and implemented the following con-
cepts:  
Topic ? a short, usually controversial statement 
that defines the subject of interest. Context De-
                                                                         
1 E.g., AraucariaDB (Reed 2005, Moens et al 2007) and 
Vaccine/Injury Project (V/IP) Corpus (Ashley and Walker 
2013).  
64
pendent Claim (CDC) ? a general concise 
statement that directly supports or contests the 
Topic. Context Dependent Evidence (CDE) ? a 
text segment that directly supports a CDC in the 
context of a given Topic. Examples are given in 
Section 6. 
Furthermore, since one can support a claim us-
ing different types of evidence (Rieke et al 2012, 
Seech 2008), we defined and considered three 
CDE types: Study: Results of a quantitative 
analysis of data given as numbers or as conclu-
sions. Expert: Testimony by a person / group / 
committee / organization with some known ex-
pertise in or authority on the topic. Anecdotal: a 
description of specific event(s)/instance(s) or 
concrete example(s). 
3 Labeling Challenges and Approach 
The main challenge we faced in collecting the 
annotated data was the inherently elusive nature 
of concepts such as "claim" and "evidence." To 
address that we formulated two sets of criteria 
for CDC and CDE, respectively, and relied on a 
team of about 20 carefully trained in-house la-
belers whose work was closely monitored. To 
further enhance the quality of the collected data 
we adopted a two-stage labeling approach. First, 
a team of five labelers worked independently on 
the same text and prepared the initial set of can-
didate CDCs or candidate CDEs. Next, a team of 
five labelers?not necessarily the same five?
independently crosschecked the joint list of the 
detected candidates, each of which was either 
confirmed or rejected. Candidates confirmed by 
at least three labelers were included in the corpus.  
4 Labeling Guidelines 
The labeling guidelines defined the concepts of 
Topic, CDC, CDE, and CDE types, along with 
relevant examples. According to these guidelines, 
given a Topic, a text fragment should be labeled 
as a CDC if and only if it complies with all of 
the following five CDC criteria: Strength: 
Strong content that directly supports or contests 
the provided Topic. Generality: General content 
that deals with a relatively broad idea. Phrasing: 
Is well phrased, or requires at most a single and 
minor "allowed" change.2  Keeping text spirit: 
Keeps the spirit of the original text from which it 
was extracted. Topic unity: Deals with one, or at 
most two related topics. Four CDE criteria were 
defined in a similar way, given a Topic and a 
CDC, except for the generality criterion. 
5 Labeling Details 
The labeling process was carried out in the 
GATE environment (https://gate.ac.uk/). The 33 
Topics were selected at random from the debate 
motions at http://idebate.org/ database. The la-
beling process was divided into five stages:  
Search: Given a Topic, five labelers were 
asked to independently search English Wikipe-
dia3 for articles with promising content.  
Claim Detection: At this stage, five labelers 
independently detected candidate CDCs support-
ing or contesting the Topic within each article 
suggested by the Search team.  
Claim Confirmation: At this stage, five la-
belers independently cross-examined the candi-
date CDCs suggested at the Claim Detection 
stage, aiming to confirm a candidate and its sen-
timent as to the given Topic, or reject it by refer-
ring to one of the five CDC Criteria it fails to 
meet. The candidate CDCs confirmed by at least 
three labelers were forwarded to the next stage.  
Evidence Detection: At this stage, five la-
belers independently detected candidate CDEs 
supporting a confirmed CDC in the context of 
the given Topic. The search for CDEs was done 
                                                 
2 For example, anaphora resolution. The enclosed data set 
contains the corrected version as well, as proposed by the 
labelers.  
3 We considered the Wikipedia dump as of April 3, 2012. 
65
only in the same article where the corresponding 
CDC was found.  
Evidence Confirmation: This stage was car-
ried out in a way similar to Claim Confirmation. 
The only difference was that the labelers were 
required to classify accepted CDE under one or 
more CDE types.  
Labelers training and feedback: Before join-
ing actual labeling tasks, novice labelers were 
assigned with several completed tasks and were 
expected to show a reasonable degree of agree-
ment with a consensus solution prepared in ad-
vance by the project administrators. In addition, 
the results of each Claim Confirmation task were 
examined by one or two of the authors (AP and 
NS) to ensure the conformity to the guidelines. 
In case crude mistakes were spotted, the corre-
sponding labeler was requested to revise and 
resubmit. Due to the large numbers of CDE can-
didates, it was impractical to rely on such a rig-
orous monitoring process in Evidence Confirma-
tion. Instead, Evidence Consensus Solutions  
were created for selected articles by several ex-
perienced labelers, who first solved the tasks 
independently and then reached consensus in a 
joint meeting. Afterwards, the tasks were as-
signed to the rest of the labelers. Their results on 
these tasks were juxtaposed with the Consensus 
Solutions, and on the basis of this comparison 
individual feedback reports were drafted and 
sent to the team members. Each labeler received 
such a report on an approximately weekly basis.   
6 Data Summary 
For 33 debate motions, a total of 586 Wikipedia 
articles were labeled. The labeling process re-
sulted in 1,392 CDCs distributed across 321 ar-
ticles. In 12 debate motions, for which 350 dis-
tinct CDCs were confirmed across 104 articles, 
we further completed the CDE labeling, ending 
up with a total of 1,291 confirmed CDEs ? 431 
of type Study, 516 of type Expert, and 529 of 
type Anecdotal. Note that some CDEs were as-
sociated with more than one type (for example, 
118 CDEs were classified both under the type 
Study and Expert). 
Presented in Tables 1 and 2 are several exam-
ples of CDCs and CDEs gathered under the 
Topics we worked with, as well as some inac-
ceptable candidates illustrating some of the sub-
tleties of the performed work. 
Topic 
The sale of violent video games to mi-
nors should be banned 
(Pro) 
CDC 
Violent video games can increase chil-
dren?s aggression 
(Pro) 
CDC 
Video game publishers unethically train 
children in the use of weapons 
Note that a valid CDC is not necessarily fa c-
tual .  
(Con) 
CDC 
Violent games affect children positively 
Invalid  
CDC 1 
Video game addiction is excessive or 
compulsive use of computer and video 
games that interferes with daily life. 
This  statement defines  a concept relevant to 
the Topic, not a relevant claim.  
Invalid  
CDC 2 
Violent TV shows just mirror the vio-
lence that goes on in the real world.  
This  claim is not relevant enough to Topic. 
Invalid  
CDC 3 
Violent video games should not be sold 
to children. 
This candidate simply repeats the Topic and 
thus  is not considered a va lid CDC.  
Invalid  
CDC 4 
?Doom? has been blamed for nationally 
covered school shooting. 
This candidate fails the generali ty cri terion, 
as it focuses on a speci fic single video game. 
Note that i t could serve as CDE to a more 
general CDC.   
Table 1: Examples of CDCs and invalid CDCs.  
 
Topic 1 
The sale of vio lent video games to 
minors should be banned 
(Pro) CDC 
Violent video games increase youth 
violence 
CDE 
(Study) 
The most  recent large scale meta-
analysis?examining 130 studies with 
over 130,000 subjects worldwide?
concluded that exposure to violent 
66
video games causes both short term 
and long term aggression in players 
CDE 
(Anecdotal) 
In April 2000, a 16-year-old teenager 
murdered his father, mother and sister 
proclaiming that he was on an "aveng-
ing mission" for the main character of 
the video game Final Fantasy VIII 
Invalid 
CDE 
While most experts reject any link 
between video games content and re-
al-life violence, some media scholars 
argue that the connection exists. 
Invalid, because i t includes information 
that contests the CDC. 
Topic 2 
The use of performance enhancing 
drugs in sports should be permitted 
(Con) CDC 
Drug abuse can be harmful to one?s 
health and even deadly. 
CDE 
(Expert) 
According to some nurse practition-
ers, stopping substance abuse can 
reduce the risk of dying early and also 
reduce some health risks like heart 
disease, lung disease, and strokes  
Invalid 
CDE 
Suicide is very common in adolescent 
alcohol abusers, with 1 in 4 suicides 
in adolescents being related to alcohol 
abuse. 
Although the candidate CDE does support 
the CDC, the notion of adolescent alcohol 
abusers  is irrelevant to the Topic. There-
fore, the candidate is invalid. 
Table 2: Examples of CDE and invalid CDE.  
7 Agreement and Recall Results 
To evaluate the labelers? agreement we used Co-
hen?s kappa coefficient (Landis and Koch 1977). 
The average measure was calculated over all 
labelers' pairs, for each pair taking those articles 
on which the corresponding labelers worked to-
gether and omitting labeler pairs which labeled 
together less than 100 CDCs/CDEs. This strate-
gy was chosen since no two labelers worked on 
the exact same tasks, so standard multi-rater 
agreement measures could not be applied. The 
obtained average kappa was 0.39 and 0.4 in the 
Claim confirmation and Evidence confirmation 
stages, respectively, which we consider satisfac-
tory given the subtlety of the concepts involved 
and the fact that the tasks naturally required a 
certain extent of subjective decision making.  
We further employed a simple method to ob-
tain a rough estimate of the recall at the detection 
stages. For CDCs (and similarly for CDEs), let n 
be the number of CDCs detected and confirmed 
in a given article, and x be the unknown total 
number of CDCs in this article. Assuming the i-
th labeler detects a ratio  of x, and taking a 
strong assumption of independence between the 
labelers, we get:  
. 
We estimated  from the observed data, and 
computed x for each article. We were then able 
to compute the estimated recall per motion, end-
ing up with the estimated average recall of 
90.6% and 90.0% for CDCs and CDEs, respec-
tively.  
8 Future Work and Conclusion 
There are several natural ways to proceed further. 
First, a considerable increase in the quantity of 
gathered CDE data can be achieved by expand-
ing the search scope beyond the article in which 
the CDC is found. Second, the argument model 
can be enhanced ? for example, to include coun-
ter-CDE (i.e., evidence that contest the CDC). 
Third, one may look into ways to add more la-
beling layers on the top of the existing model 
(for example, distinguishing between factual 
CDCs, value CDCs, and so forth). Fourth, new 
topics and new sources besides Wikipedia can be 
considered.  
The data is released and available upon request 
for academic research. We hope that it will prove 
useful for different data mining communities, 
and particularly for various purposes in the field 
of Argumentation Mining.
