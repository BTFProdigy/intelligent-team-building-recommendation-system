Abstract
We present a summary of the first shared
task on automatic text correction for Ara-
bic text. The shared task received 18 sys-
tems submissions from nine teams in six
countries and represented a diversity of ap-
proaches. Our report includes an overview
of the QALB corpus which was the source
of the datasets used for training and eval-
uation, an overview of participating sys-
tems, results of the competition and an
analysis of the results and systems.
1 Introduction
The task of text correction has recently gained a
lot of attention in the Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) community. Most of the effort in this
area concentrated on English, especially on errors
made by learners of English as a Second Lan-
guage. Four competitions devoted to error cor-
rection for non-native English writers took place
recently: HOO (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale
et al., 2012) and CoNLL (Ng et al., 2013; Ng et
al., 2014). Shared tasks of this kind are extremely
important, as they bring together researchers who
focus on this problem and promote development
and dissemination of key resources, such as bench-
mark datasets.
Recently, there have been several efforts aimed
at creating data resources related to the correc-
tion of Arabic text. Those include human anno-
tated corpora (Zaghouani et al., 2014; Alfaifi and
Atwell, 2012), spell-checking lexicon (Attia et al.,
2012) and unannotated language learner corpora
(Farwaneh and Tamimi, 2012). A natural exten-
sion to these resource production efforts is the cre-
ation of robust automatic systems for error correc-
tion.

In this paper, we present a summary of the
QALB shared task on automatic text correction
for Arabic. The Qatar Arabic Language Bank
(QALB) project
1
is one of the first large scale data
and system development efforts for automatic cor-
rection of Arabic which has resulted in annota-
tion of the QALB corpus. In conjunction with the
EMNLP Arabic NLP workshop, the QALB shared
task is the first community effort for construction
and evaluation of automatic correction systems for
Arabic.
The results of the competition indicate that the
shared task attracted a lot of interest and generated
a diverse set of approaches from the participating
teams.
In the next section, we present the shared task
framework. This is followed by an overview of
the QALB corpus (Section 3). Section 4 describes
the shared task data, and Section 5 presents the ap-
proaches adopted by the participating teams. Sec-
tion 6 discusses the results of the competition. Fi-
nally, in Section 7, we offer a brief analysis and
present preliminary experiments on system com-
bination.
2 Task Description
The QALB shared task was created as a forum for
competition and collaboration on automatic error
correction in Modern Standard Arabic. The shared
task makes use of the QALB corpus (Zaghouani et
al., 2014), which is a manually-corrected collec-
tion of Arabic texts. The shared task participants
were provided with training and development data
to build their systems, but were also free to make
use of additional resources, including corpora, lin-
guistic resources, and software, as long as these
were publicly available.
For evaluation, a standard framework devel-
