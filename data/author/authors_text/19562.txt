Abstract
In this paper we present a readability assessment system for Basque, ErreXail, which is going
to be the preprocessing module of a Text Simplification system. To that end we compile two
corpora, one of simple texts and another one of complex texts. To analyse those texts, we imple-
ment global, lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic, syntactic and pragmatic features based
on other languages and specially considered for Basque. We combine these feature types and we
train our classifiers. After testing the classifiers, we detect the features that perform best and the
most predictive ones.
1 Introduction
Readability assessment is a research line that aims to grade the difficulty or the ease of the texts. It has
been a remarkable question in the educational domain during the last century and is of great importance
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) during the last decade. Classical readability formulae like Flesh
formula (Flesch, 1948), Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and The Gunning FOG index (Gun-
ning, 1968) take into account raw and lexical features and frequency counts. NLP techniques, on the
other hand, make possible the consideration of more complex features.
Recent research in NLP (Si and Callan, 2001; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Feng, 2009) has demon-
strated that classical readability formulae are unreliable. Moreover, those metrics are language specific.
Readability assessment is also used as a preprocess or evaluation in Text Simplification (TS) systems
e.g. for English (Feng et al., 2010), Portuguese (Alu??sio et al., 2010), Italian (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011),
German (Hancke et al., 2012) and Spanish (
?
Stajner and Saggion, 2013). Given a text the aim of these
systems is to decide whether a text is complex or not. So, in case of being difficult, the given text should
be simplified.
As far as we know no specific metric has been used to calculate the complexity of Basque texts. The
only exception we find is a system for the auto-evaluation of essays Idazlanen Autoebaluaziorako Sistema
(IAS) (Aldabe et al., 2012) which includes metrics similar to those used in readability assessment. IAS
analyses Basque texts after several criteria focused on educational correction such as the clause number
in a sentence, types of sentences, word types and lemma number among others. It was foreseen to use
this tool in the Basque TS system (Aranzabe et al., 2012). The present work means to add to IAS the
capacity of evaluating the complexity of texts by means of new linguistic features and criteria.
In this paper we present ErreXail, a readability assessment system for Basque, a Pre-Indo-European
agglutinative head-final pro-drop language, which displays a rich inflectional morphology and whose
orthography is phonemic. ErreXail classifies the texts and decides if they should be simplified or not.
This work has two objectives: to build a classifier which will be the preprocess of the TS system and to
know which are the most predictive features that differ in complex and simple texts. The study of the
most predictive features will help in the linguistic analysis of the complex structures of Basque as well.
This paper is organised as follows: In section 2 we offer an overview about this topic. We present the
corpora we gathered and its processing in section 3. In section 4 we summarise the linguistic features we

implemented and we present the experiments and their results in section 5. The present system, ErreXail,
is described in section 6 and in section 7 we compare our work with other studies. Finally, we conclude
and outline the future work (section 8).
2 Related work
In the last years new methods have been proposed to assess the readability in NLP. For English, Si
and Callan (2001) use statistical models, exactly unigram language models, combined with traditional
readability features like sentence length and number of syllables per word. Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al.,
2004) is a tool that analyses multiple characteristics and levels of language-discourse such us narrativity,
word concreteness or noun overlap. In the 3.0 version
1
108 indices are available. Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) use lexical, syntactic, and discourse features emphasising the importance of discourse features as
well. Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) combine features from statistical language models, parse features,
and other traditional features using support vector machines.
It is very interesting to take a look at readability systems for other languages as well. Some readability
metrics take them into account special characteristics linked to languages. For example, in Chinese the
number of strokes is considered (Pang, 2006), in Japanese the different characters (Sato et al., 2008), in
German the word formation (vor der Br?uck et al., 2008), in French the pass?e simple (Franc?ois and Fairon,
2012) and the orthographic neighbourhood (Gala et al., 2013) and in Swedish vocabulary resources
(Sj?oholm, 2012; Falkenjack et al., 2013) among many other features. For Portuguese, Coh-metrix has
been adapted (Scarton and Alu??sio, 2010) and in Arabic language-specific formulae have been used (Al-
Ajlan et al., 2008; Daud et al., 2013). Looking at free word order, head final and rich morphology
languages, Sinha et al. (2012) propose two new measures for Hindi and for Bangla based on English
formulae. Other systems use only machine learning techniques, e.g. for Chinese (Chen et al., 2011).
The systems whose motivation is Text Simplification analyse linguistic features of the text and then
they use machine learning techniques to build the classifiers. These systems have been created for English
(Feng et al., 2010), Portuguese (Alu??sio et al., 2010), Italian (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011) and German
(Hancke et al., 2012). We follow the similar methodology for Basque since we share the same aim.
Readability assessment can be focused on different domains such as legal, medical, education and so
on. Interesting points about readability are presented in DuBay (2004) and an analysis of the methods
and a review of the systems is presented in Benjamin (2012) and Zamanian and Heydari (2012).
3 Corpora
Being our aim to build a model to distinguish simple and complex texts and to know which are the
most predictive features based on NLP techniques, we needed to collect the corpora. We gathered texts
from the web and compiled two corpora. The first corpus, henceforth T-comp, is composed by 200
texts (100 articles and 100 analysis) from the Elhuyar aldizkaria
2
, a monthly journal about science and
technology in Basque. T-comp is meant to be the complex corpus. The second corpus, henceforth T-simp,
is composed by 200 texts from ZerNola
3
, a website to popularise science among children up to 12 years
and the texts we collected are articles. To find texts specially written for children was really challenging.
Main statistics about both corpora are presented in Table 1.

T-simp 200 2363 39565 12203 13447

This preprocess is necessary to perform the analysis of the features presented in section 4.
4 Linguistic features
In this section we summarise the linguistic features implemented to analyse the complexity of the texts.
We distinguish different groups of features: global, lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic, syntactic
and pragmatic features. There are in total 94 features. Most of the features we present have already been
included in systems for other languages but others have been specially considered for Basque.
4.1 Global features
Global features take into account the document as whole and serve to give an overview of the texts. They
are presented in Table 2.
Averages
Average of words per sentence
Average of clauses per sentence
Average of letters per word
Table 2: Global features
These features are based on classical readability formulae and in the criteria taken on the simplification
study (Gonzalez-Dios, 2011), namely the sentence length and the clause number per sentence. They are
also included in IAS (Aldabe et al., 2012).
4.2 Lexical features
Lexical features are based on lemmas. We calculate the ratios of all the POS tags and different kinds of
abbreviations and symbols. We concentrate on particular types of substantives and verbs as well. Part of
theses ratios are shown in Table 3. In total there are 39 ratios in this group.
Ratios
Unique lemmas / all the lemmas
Each POS / all the words
Proper Nouns / all the nouns
Named entities / all the nouns
Verbal nouns / all the verbs
Modal verbs / all the verbs
Causative verbs / all the verbs
Intransitive verbs with one arg. (Nor verbs) / all the verbs
Intransitive verbs with two arg. (Nor-Nori verbs) / all the verbs
Transitive verbs with two arg. (Nor-Nork verbs) / all the verbs
Transitive verbs with three arg. (Nor-Nori-Nork) verbs / all the verbs
Acronyms / all the words
Abbreviations / all the words
Symbols / all the words
Table 3: Lexical features
Among those features, we want to point out the causative verbs and the intransitive or transitive verbs
with one, two or three arguments (arg.) as features related to Basque. Causative verbs are verbs with the
336
suffix -arazi and they are usually translated as ?to make someone + verb?, e.g. edanarazi, that stands
for ?to make someone drink?. Other factitive verbs are translated without using that paraphrase like
jakinarazi that means ?to notify?, lit. ?to make know?. The transitivity classification is due to the fact
that Basque verb agrees with three grammatical cases (ergative Nork, absolutive Nor and dative Nori)
and therefore verbs are grouped according to the arguments they take in Basque grammars.
4.3 Morphological features
Morphological features analyse the different ways lemmas can be realised. These features are sum-
marised in Table 4 and there are 24 ratios in total.
Ratios
Each case ending / all the case endings
Each verb aspect / all the verbs
Each verb tense / all the verbs
Each verb mood / all the verbs
Words with ellipsis / all the words
Each type of words with ellipsis / all the words with ellipsis
Table 4: Morphological features
Basque has 18 case endings (absolutive, ergative, inessive, allative, genitive...), that is, 18 different
endings can be attached to the end of the noun phrases. For example, if we attach the inessive -n to
the noun phrase etxea ?the house?, we get etxean ?at home?. The verb features considered the forms
obtained with the inflection.
Verb morphology is very rich in Basque as well. The aspect is attached to the part of the verb which
contains the lexical information. There are 4 aspects: puntual (aoristic), perfective, imperfective and
future aspect. Verb tenses are usually marked in the auxiliary verb and there are four tenses: present,
past, irreal and archaic future
4
. The verbal moods are indicative, subjunctive, imperative and potential.
The latter is used to express permissibility or possible circumstances.
Due to the typology of Basque, ellipsis
5
is a normal phenomenon and ellipsis can be even found
within a word (verbs, nouns, adjective...); for instance, dioguna which means ?what we say?. This kind
of ellipsis occurs e.g. in English, Spanish, French and German as well but in these languages it is realised
as a sentence; but it is expressed only by a word in Basque.
4.4 Morpho-syntactic features
Morpho-syntactic features are based on the shallow parsing (chunks
6
) and in the apposition detection
(appositions). These features are presented in Table 5.
Ratios
Noun phrases (chunks) / all the phrases
Noun phrases (chunks) / all the sentences
Verb phrases / all the phrases
Appositions / all the phrases
Appositions / all the noun phrases (chunks)
Table 5: Morpho-syntactic features
Contrary to the features so far presented, the morpho-syntactic features take into account mainly more
than a word. About apposition, there are 2 types in Basque (Gonzalez-Dios et al., 2013) but we consider
all the instances together in this work.
4
The archaic future we also take into account is not used anymore, but it can be found in old texts. Nowadays, the aspect is
used to express actions in the future.
5
Basque is a pro-drop language and it is very normal to omit the subject, the object and the indirect object because they are
marked in the verb. We do not treat this kind of ellipsis in the present work.
6
Chunks are a continuum of elements with a head and syntactic sense that do not overlap (Abney, 1991).
337
4.5 Syntactic features
Syntactic features consider average of the subordinate clauses and types of subordinate clauses. They
are outlined in Table 6 and there are 10 ratios in total. The types of adverbial clauses are temporal,
causal, conditional, modal, concessive, consecutive and modal-temporal. The latter is a clause type
which expresses manner and simultaneity of the action in reference to the main clause.
Ratios
Subordinate clauses / all the clauses
Relative clauses / subordinate clauses
Completive clauses / subordinate clauses
Adverbial clauses / subordinate clauses
Each type of adverbial clause / subordinate clauses
Table 6: Syntactic features
In this first approach we decided not to use dependency based features like dependency depth or
distance from dependent to head because dependency parsing is time consuming and slows down the
preprocessing. Moreover, the importance of syntax is under discussion: Petersen and Ostendorf (2009)
find that syntax does not have too much influence while Sj?oholm (2012) shows that dependencies are
not necessary. Pitler and Nenkova (2008) pointed out the importance of syntax. but Dell?Orletta et
al. (2011) demonstrate that for document classification reliable results can be found without syntax.
Anyway, syntax is necessary for sentence classification.
4.6 Pragmatic features
In our cases, the pragmatic features we examine are the cohesive devices. These features are summed up
in Table 7. There are 12 ratios in total.
Ratios
Each type of conjunction / all the conjunctions
Each type of sentence connector / all the sentence connectors
Table 7: Pragmatic features
Conjunction types are additive, adversative and disjuntive. Sentence connector types are additive,
adversative, disjuntive, clarificative, causal, consecutive, concessive and modal.
5 Experiments
We performed two experiments, the first one to build a classifier and the second one to know which are
the most predictive features. For both tasks we used the WEKA tool (Hall et al., 2009).
In the first experiment we ran 5 classifiers and evaluated their performance. Those classifiers were
Random Forest (Breiman, 2001), the J48 decision tree (Quinlan, 1993), K-Nearest Neighbour, IBk (Aha
et al., 1991), Na??ve Bayes (John and Langley, 1995) and Support Vector Machine with SMO algorithm
(Platt, 1998). We used 10 fold cross-validation, similar to what has been done in other studies.
Taking into account all the features presented in section 4, the best results were obtained using SMO.
This way, 89.50 % of the instances were correctly classified. The F -measure for complex text was 0.899
%, for simple texts was 0.891 % and the MAE was 0.105 %. The results using all the features are shown
in Table 8.

88.50 84.75 72.00 84.50 89.50
Table 8: Classification results using all the features
We classified each feature type on their own as well and the best results were obtained using only
lexical features, 90.75 %. The classification results according to their feature group are presented in
Table 9. We only present the classifiers with the best results and these are remarked in bold.

Table 9: Classification results of each feature type
We also made different combinations of feature types and the accuracy was improved. The best com-
bination group was the one formed by lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic and syntactic features
and they obtain 93.50 % with SMO. Best results are show in Table 10.

Lex+Morph+Morph-sint+Sintax+Prag 88.50 90.25
Sintax+Prag 78.25 73.50
Table 10: Classification results using different feature combinations
Combining the feature types, SMO is the best classifier in most of the cases but Random Forest out-
performs the results when there are no lexical features.
In the second experiment, we analysed which were the most predictive linguistic features in each
group. We used Weka?s Information Gain (InfoGain AttributeEval) to create the ranking and we ran it
for each feature group. In Table 11 we present the 10 most predictive features taking all the features
groups into account.
The results of this experiment are interesting for the linguistic studies on Text Simplification. It shows
us indeed which phenomena we should work on next. In these experiment we notice as well the relevance
of the lexical features and that syntactic features are not so decisive in document classification.
The features with relevance 0 have been analysed as well. Some of them are e.g. the ratio of the
inessive among all the case endings, the ratio of the indicative mood among all the verbal moods, the
ratio of the adjectives among all the words and the ratio of the ratio of the present tense among all the
verbal tenses.
We also performed a classification experiment with the top 10 features and J48 is the best classifier
(its best performance as well). These results are presented in Table 12.
To sum up, our best results are obtained using a combination of features (Lex+Morph+Morph-
sint+Sintax). We want to remark the importance of lexical features as well, since they alone outperform
all the features and 5 of them are among the top ten features.
6 System overview
The readability system for Basque ErreXail has a three-stage architecture (Figure 1).
So, given a Basque written text, we follow next steps:
1. The linguistic analysis will be carried out, that is, morpho-syntactic tagging, lemmatisation, syntac-
tic function identification, named entity recognition, shallow parsing, sentence and clause bound-
aries determination and apposition identification will be performed. We will use the tools presented
in section 3.
339
Feature and group Relevance
Proper nouns / common nouns ratio (Lex.) 0.2744
Appositions / noun phrases ratio (Morpho-synt.) 0.2529
Appositions / all phrases ratio (Morpho-synt.) 0.2529
Named entities / common nouns ratio (Lex.) 0.2436
Unique lemmas / all the lemmas ratio (Lex.) 0.2394
Acronyms / all the words ratio (Lex.) 0.2376
Causative verbs / all the verbs ratio (Lex.) 0.2099
Modal-temporal clauses / subordinate clauses ratio (Synt.) 0.2056
Destinative case endings / all the case endings ratio (Morph.) 0.1968
Connectors of clarification / all the connectors ratio (Prag.) 0.1957

2. Texts will be analysed according to the features and measures presented in section 4.
3. We will use the SMO Support Vector Machine as classification model, since that was the best
classifier in the experiments exposed in section 5. To speed up the process for Text Simplification,
we will analyse only the combination of lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic and syntactic
(Lex+Morph+Morph-sint+Sintax) features.
Although the first application of this system will be the preprocessing of texts for the Basque TS
system, the system we present in this paper is independent and can be used for any other application. We
want to remark that this study, as it is based on other languages, could be applied to any other language
as well provided that the text could be analysed similar to us.
7 Discussion
The task of text classification has been carried out by several studies before. Due to our small corpus
we were only able to discriminate between complex and simple texts like Dell?Orletta et al. (2011) and
Hancke et al. (2012), other studies have classified more complexity levels (Schwarm and Ostendorf,
2005; Alu??sio et al., 2010; Franc?ois and Fairon, 2012). In this section we are going to compare our
system with other systems that share our same goal, namely to know which texts should be simplified.
Comparing our experiment with studies that classify two grades and use SMO, Hancke et al. (2012)
obtain an accuracy of 89.7 % with a 10 fold cross-validation. These results are very close to ours, al-
though their data compiles 4603 documents and ours 400. According to the feature type, their best type
is the morphological, obtaining 85.4 % of accuracy. Combining lexical, language model and morpho-
logical features they obtain 89.4 % of accuracy. To analyse their 10 most predictive features, they use
Information Gain as well but we do not share any feature in common.
Dell?Orletta et al. (2011) perform three different experiments but only their first experiment is similar
to our work. For that classification experiment they use 638 documents and follow a 5 fold cross-
validation process of the Euclidian distance between vectors. Taking into account all the features the
accuracy of their system is 97.02 %. However, their best performance is 98.12 % when they only use the
combination of raw, lexical and morpho-syntactic features.
340
Alu??sio et al. (2010) assess the readability of the texts according to three levels: rudimentary, basic
and advanced. In total they compile 592 texts. Using SMO, 10 fold cross-validation and standard classi-
fication, they obtain 0.276 MAE taking into account all the features. The F -measure for original texts is
0.913, for natural simplification 0.483 and for strong simplification 0.732. They experiment with feature
types as well but they obtain their best results using all the features. Among their highly correlated fea-
tures they present the incidence of apposition in second place as we do here. We do not have any other
feature in common.
Among other readability assessment whose motivation is TS, Feng et al. (2010) use LIBSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2001) and Logistic Regression from WEKA and 10 fold cross-validation. They assess the
readability of grade texts and obtain as best results 59.63 % with LIBSVM and 57.59 % with Logistic
Regression. Since they assess different grades and use other classifiers it is impossible to compare with
our results but we find that we share predictive features. They found out that named entity density and
and nouns have predictive power as well.
8 Conclusion and perspectives
In this paper we have presented the first readability assessment system for the Basque language. We
have implemented 94 ratios based on linguistic features similar to those used in other languages and
specially defined for Basque and we have built a classifier which is able to discriminate between difficult
and easy texts. We have also determined which are the most predictive features. From our experiments
we conclude that using only lexical features or a combination of features types we obtain better results
than using all the features. Moreover, we deduce that we do not need to use time consuming resources
like dependency parsing or big corpora to obtain good results.
For the future, we could implement new features like word formation or word ordering both based in
other languages and in neurolinguistic studies that are being carried out for Basque. Other machine learn-
ing techniques can be used, e.g. language models and in the case of getting a bigger corpora or a graded
one, we could even try to differentiate more reading levels. We also envisage readability assessment at
sentence level in near future.

Multilingual Approach

Abstract
In this paper we present Biografix, a pattern based tool that simplifies parenthetical structures with
biographical information, whose aim is to create simple, readable and accessible sentences. To
that end, we analysed the parenthetical structures that appear in the first paragraph of the Basque
Wikipedia, and concentrated on biographies. Although it has been designed and developed for
Basque we adapted it and evaluated with other five languages. We also perform an extrinsic
evaluation with a question generation system to see if Biografix improve its results.
1 Introduction and motivation
Parentheticals are expressions, somehow structurally independent, that integrated in a text function as
modifiers of phrases, sentences..., and add information or comments to the text. Therefore, it has been
argued that they interrupt the prosodic flow, breaking the intonation. According to Deh?e and Kavalova
(2007), parentheticals can be realised in different ways: one-word parentheticals, sentence adverbials,
comment clauses and reporting verbs, nominal apposition and non-restrictive relative clauses, question
tags, clauses and backtracking. Besides, the authors argue that sometimes the parentheticals are not
related to the host sentence neither semantically nor pragmatically, but they are understood in the text
due to the situational context.
Some parentheticals can be the result of a stylistic choice (Blakemore, 2006) and that is the case of par-
enthetical information found in the first paragraph of some Wikipedia articles. As stated in the Wikipedia
guidelines
1
the first paragraph of the articles should contain resuming and important information. That
is why the information is there so condensed. Apart from condensing the information parentheticals
cause long sentences, which are more difficult to process both for humans and for advanced applications.
Moreover, web writting style books (Amatria et al., 2013) suggest not to use parenthetical constructs be-
cause they make more difficult the access to the information. Simple wikipedia guidelines
2
recommend
also not to use two sets of brackets next to each other.
NLP applications such as question generation systems (QG) for educational domain
3
may fail when
finding important information in brackets. For example, if we want to create questions, systems such
as the presented in Aldabe et al. (2013) will look for a verb
4
. In the case of parenthetical biographical
information there is no verb which makes explicit when the person is born or when she or he died. So,
no question will be created based on that information.
The study of parentheticals in Basque has been limited to the analysis of the irony in the narrativity
of Koldo Mitxelena (Azpeitia, 2011). In the present study we analyse the parentheticals that are used
in the first paragraph of the Basque Wikipedia and developed a rule-based tool Biografix to detect these

structures and to create new sentences out of them. To be more concrete, we concentrate on biographical
information since there are not explicit words in text that give a clue about what type of information it is.
Our aim is to make more readable sentences and, consequently, to eliminate the interruption they cause.
About the domain of biographies, their automatic generation has been studied (Duboue et al., 2003) in
Natural Language Generation (NLG). In this research line, referring expressions to people have been
studied for automatic summarisation of news (Siddharthan et al., 2011). The quality of the biographies
(linguistic and content) has been recently analysed in the English Wikipedia (Flekova et al., 2014).
We want also to make a first step towards the simplification of Basque Wikipedia, since English sim-
ple wikipedia has been a great resource for Text Simplification (TS) and Readability Assessement (RA).
Efforts for simple wikipedia have also been made for Portuguese (Junior et al., 2011) using TS tech-
niques. Although Biografix has been specially developed for Basque, being pattern-based, we have also
evaluated its adaptation to other languages. This work is not limited to wikipedia, Biografix can be used
on other types of text as well, since these structures can be found in educational texts, newspapers and
so on.
This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction we report in section 2 the treatment of
parentheticals in TS and in Wikipedia. In section 3 we describe Biografix and in section 4 we report its
evaluation. Finally, we conclude and outline the future work in section 5.
2 Parenthetical Structures
In this section we report the treatment that parenthentical structures have undergone in TS and other NLP
applications. We also describe the parentheticals found in Basque Wikipedia.
Parentheticals have been object of study in TS and three main operations have been proposed: a)
parentheticals have been removed out of the texts (Drndarevi?c et al., 2013), b) parentheticals have been
removed but they have been kept in another form (Aranzabe et al., 2012; Seretan, 2012) or c) paren-
theticals have been added to explain the meaning by short paraphrases (Hallett and Hardcastle, 2008) or
hyperonyms (Leroy et al., 2013). In any case, it is usually recommended to avoid them (Alu??sio et al.,
2008). In other NLP applications such as summarisation they are usually removed and even some QG
works follow the same strategy, in case they are not relevant (Heilman and Smith, 2010).
2.1 Parenthetical Structures in Basque Wikipedia
Wikipedia guidelines emphasise the importance of the first paragraph. It should indeed contain a sum-
mary of the most significant information. To concentrate all the information, stylistic resources such as
parenthentical structures are used. The information that is written in brackets in the Basque Wikipedia
can be classified in two groups: a) information about people and b) information about concepts. About
people biographical data and mandates are usually found and about concepts the etymology of words is
frequent. Translations or transliterations of the named entity or the concept is found for both groups.
On the other hand, there are other frequent parenthetical structures that are found in the first paragraph,
but they are not written in brackets. This is the case of the nicknames, which are written in commas. This
kind of information is also found in other languages. After this analysis, we decided to concentrate on
biographical data to create new sentences out of that information.
Biographical data Contrary to English Wikipedia, in Basque Wikipedia the information contained in
bracket is, if known, birthplace (town, province, state), date of birth, and if the person is dead, date of
death and place of dead. This is the case as well of the Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German
and French Wikipedia among others, although sometimes paraphrases are found in brackets. For French
there is, for example, more than a way to write the biographical data
5
.
In Basque Wikipedia guidelines
6
it is stated that biographical data should be written as in examples 1
and 2. If the person is dead, we see in example 1 that the birth data (town, state and date) and the death
data (town, state and date) are linked by a dash.

(1) Ernest Rutherford, Nelsongo lehenengo baroia, (Brightwater, Zeelanda Berria, 1871ko abuztu-
aren 30a - Cambridge, Ingalaterra, 1937ko urriaren 19a) fisika nuklearraren aita izan zen.
?Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, (Brightwater, New Zeeland, 30th August,
1871 - Cambridge, England, 19th October, 1937) was the father of the nuclear Physics.?
And if the person is alive, only birth data (town, province, date) is provided as in example 2.
(2) Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, nazioartean Karlos Argui?nano grafiaz ezagunagoa, (Beasain,
Gipuzkoa, 1948ko irailaren 6a) sukaldari, aktore eta enpresaburu euskalduna da.
?Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, internationally known with the Karlos Argui?nano spelling, (Beasain,
Gipuzkoa, 6th September, 1948) is a basque chef, actor and businessman.?
In both cases, the places (if known) should precede the date and these should be separated by commas.
However, biographical data is not frequently written uniformly. Places do not precede the date, the date
is incomplete (only year) and sometimes other characters like the question mark appear to denote that
the place or the date is known.
Taking into account this guidelines and the articles we have analysed, we have developed Biografix, a
pattern based tool that detects biographical data and creates new sentences with this information. This
tool was originally developed for Basque but it has been adapted to other languages. An adaptation
of this tool, moreover, could be used as a first step into Text Summarisation, if we only remove the
parentheticals and do not create new sentences.
Biographical information is contained in brackets in other Wikipedias as well but formats may be
different. The way of writing, for example, in Catalan, German and Portuguese is similar to Basque. In
Spanish, French, and Italian that format is also used but, as mentioned beforehand, other formats are also
accepted.
3 Inside Biografix
Biografix is a pattern-based tool that simplifies the biographical data and creates new sentences out of that
information. Having as an input the example 1 in subsection 2.1, Biografix will produce the sentences 3,
4, 5, 6 and 7.
(3) Ernest Rutherford, Nelsongo lehenengo baroia, fisika nuklearraren aita izan zen.
?Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, was the father of the nuclear Physics.?
(4) Ernest Rutherford 1871ko abuztuaren 30ean Brightwateren jaio zen.
?Ernest Rutherford was born on the 30th of August, 1871 in Brightwater.?
(5) Brightwater Zeelanda Berrian dago.
?Brightwater is in New Zeeland.?
(6) Ernest Rutherford 1937ko urriaren 19an Cambridgen hil zen.
?Ernest Rutherford died on the 19th of October, 1937 in Cambridge.?
(7) Cambridge Ingalaterran dago.
?Cambridge is in England.?
So, if the person is dead, Biografix will write first the main sentence (3) followed by a new sentence (4)
with the information about the birth. If the birthplace is composed by more than a place entity, sentences
like (5) will be written. After the birth information, a sentence will contain the information about the
death (6). For the cases that more than a place appear, those will be rewritten (7).
If the person is alive like in example 2 in subsection 2.1, the same process will take place, but no death
information will appear by creating the new sentences 8, 9 and 10.
(8) Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, nazioartean Karlos Argui?nano grafiaz ezagunagoa, sukaldari, aktore
eta enpresaburu euskalduna da.
?Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, internationally known with the Karlos Argui?nano spelling, is a basque
chef, actor and businessman.?
13
(9) Karlos Argi?nano 1948ko irailaren 6an Beasainen jaio zen.
?Karlos Argi?nano was born on the 6th of September, 1948 in Beasain.?
(10) Beasain Gipuzkoan dago.
?Beasain is in Gipuzkoa.?
So, first, main information will be kept (8) and then the information about the birth will appear (9). As
a second place information (the province) original sentence (2), it will be rewritten as well (10).
We have to mention that we use the title of the article as the subject of the sentences containing the
biographical information. That is way we see that in sentences 9 and 10 the subject is Karlos Argi?nano
and the subject in sentence 8 is Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola. We took this decision for cases where the
real name of person is not so known, e.g. Cherilyn Sarkisian. Had we used Cherilyn Sarkisian in all the
sentences, would someone have known we are talking about Cher?
To carry out these simplifying transformations Biografix follows the simplification process explained
in Aranzabe et al. (2012):
? Splitting: In this stage we get the parts of the sentences we are going to work with. To that end,
three steps take place: a) the parenthetical structure is removed from the original sentence; b) the
type of parenthetical expression is checked looking at whether there are birth and death data or only
the former; c) dates and places are split. We use simple patterns to detect the dates and the places.
As it is possible to find more than a place, they will be split by the commas. This stage is common
for all the languages.
? Reconstruction: The new simplified sentences are created in this stage. This part is language-
dependent, since we add the verbs, determinants, prepositions and case markers. In the case of
Basque we also remove the absolutive case that is found in some articles
7
. Anyway, we create three
kind of sentences that are common for all the languages with the constructs obtained in the splitting
stage: a) sentences indicating birth data, b) sentences indicating death data and c) sentences indicat-
ing place specifications. The main sentence will be kept as in the original version (the parenthetical
has been removed in the splitting stage).
? Reordering: The sentences will be ordered in text. First, the main sentence; second, the information
about the birth; if there is more than a place, the following sentences will contain that information
(place specifications); third, the information about the death (if dead) and finally, the death place
specifications.
? Correction: The aim of this stage is to check if there are any mistake in the new sentences and to
correct them. As one of our goals is to know the correctness of Biografix?s output this stage has not
been implemented yet.
Biografix has been designed for Basque and then the reconstruction stage has been adapted to other 7
languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese. To develop the Basque
version we implemented the guidelines in Wikipedia (see subsection 2.1) and we used a small corpus
of 50 sentences to find possible cases, where the guidelines are not fulfilled. These 50 sentences were
randomly crawled.
For other languages, we did not make any change in the splitting stage but for German. According
to German Wikipedia guidelines birth and death data are separated by a semicolon and not by a dash.
Although French, Spanish and Italian have other options to express the biographical information between
bracket we did not implement them. Our aim is not to create a tool specially for these languages, but to
see if the design for Basque can be applicable to other languages. That is why, the adaptations to other
languages are available at our website
8
, if someone wants to improve them.
7
The absolutive case is used according to the format of the date.
8
https://ixa.si.ehu.es/Ixa/Produktuak/1403535629
14
Other improvements could be done in the reconstruction stage. To rewrite the sentences we have used
the most familiar past tense in each language. The only exception was French. The most familiar past
tense according to the context is the pass?e compos?e but this tense requires the agreement of the gender
between subject and verb
9
. As the pass?e simple is not very familiar we decided to use the present tense
to avoid the concordance problem. So, this could be one of the things to take into account for future
developers.
No other changes should be done in the reordering stage but the correction has to be adapted to each
language. No training was performed for the other languages. Only 3-5 sentences were used to check
that there were no errors.
4 Evaluation
In order to evaluate Biografix we crawled the first sentence of 30 Wikipedia articles. The method to
select these articles was the following: a) we used CatScan V2.0?
10
to get a list of the Biographies in
Basque Wikipedia; b) we randomised that list and make another list to see which articles were written
in 8 languages (Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish); c) we
selected the first 32 articles. The first two articles were used to explain and train the annotators. The final
test-sample had, therefore, 30 items.
Having that sample, we performed two evaluations: a manual evaluation (section 4.1) and a extrinsic
evaluation with a question generation system (section 4.2).
4.1 Manual evaluation
The manual evaluation was carried out for 6 languages: Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German
and Spanish. 10 linguists took part in the evaluation process and they evaluated three aspects of the
task: the original sentences (JatTestua), Biografix performance (Prog) and the grammaticality of the new
simplified sentences (Gram). In total they answered nine yes/no questions. This evaluation method we
are proposing is useful to perform an error analysis and find out which are the weak points of our tool.
To evaluate the performance and the adaptation of Biografix we chose six languages according to the
format of the biographical data: i) Basque (the language Biografix has been designed for) ii) Catalan
(same format as Basque), iii) German (same format but a slightly variation), iv) Spanish (same format as
Basque but other options as well), v) French (same format as Basque in one of the parenthetical formats
and other options), vi) Galician (without defined format). Portuguese and Italian were not evaluated be-
cause their case studies were already evaluated with Catalan and Spanish. All the sample were evaluated
by two annotators except for Catalan and Galician, because Catalan has the same case study as Basque
and Galician has not a predefined format that could cause confusion.
Questions concerning the original sentences (JatTestua) Three questions were presented in regards
to the original sentence in Wikipedia. The aim is to know if the original sentences do have parenthetical
structures and therefore, how many of them are candidates to simplification (coverage).
1. Are there parenthetical structures written between brackets?
2. Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard?
3. Is the punctuation correct?
We asked about the grammaticality and the punctuation of original sentences (correctness) because it
was shown in Aldabe et al. (2013) that many source sentences were incorrect and that fact decreased the
performance of the question generators and the correctness of the created questions.
9
e.g. Cher est n?ee en Californie., but Ernest Rutherford est n?e? en Angleterre.
10

15
Questions concerning the performance of Biografix (Prog) Four questions were designed to check if
Biografix carries out the process it has been implemented for (precision).
1. Have parenthetical structures been removed?
2. Is all the information kept?
3. Taking into account the original sentence, is all the information correct?
4. Is there new information?
Second and third questions are essential to know if at rewriting in the reconstruction stage no informa-
tion has been omitted or changed. The aim of the forth question is to know, for example, if sentences with
other kind of information like translations have been added and treated as biographical or if a sentence
referring to the death of a living person has been created.
Questions concerning the grammaticality of the new simplified sentences (Gram) Two questions
were prepared to check the correctness of the simplified questions, since to create correct sentences is
very important to understand the text. These questions should be answered for each simplified sentence
(grammatical precision).
1. Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard?
2. Is the punctuation correct?
If these questions get negative results, we cannot forget that in our simplification study we consider the
correction as a last step. This way, the output of Biografix will be checked and, were there any mistakes,
they would be corrected.
4.1.1 Results of the manual evaluation
In table 1 we present the results obtained in the manual evaluation and it shows the results considering
the following measures:
1. The coverage is the percentages out of 30 (the size of the sample) Biografix processed, that is, the
sentences that had parentheticals.
2. The correctness is the percentage of the source sentences whose grammar and punctuation is correct.
3. The recall is the division between the number of the created simple sentences and the number of the
sentences it should have created taking into account all the information in the original sentences.
4. The precision is the division between the correct performed, that is, all the Prog questions have been
correctly answered and the processed sentences. We call this precision at performance.
5. The grammatical precision is the correctly created sentences among the created sentences.
In the second-last column we show the ? agreement of the evaluators (Cohen, 1960). As we have few
examples, the expected agreement is very high and it causes low scores. That is the reason why we also
show the percentage agreement (observed agreement) in the last column.
Taking a look at the results for Basque, we see that Biografix is able to create almost all the sentences
(recall: 0.94) and that they are correct (grammatical precision: 0.87), although there are little problems
keeping all the information and keeping it right (precision: 0.79). Taking into account that the percentage
of the correct source sentences is low (82.76), we follow Aldabe et al. (2013) and recalculate the results
without the incorrect sentences. This way, recall is 0.93, precision is 0.80, grammatical precision is
0.88. As we see, results do not vary that much, since the grammaticality of the source sentence has
only influence in the first of the created sentences. About the agreement between annotators, we see that
? is really low (0.37) due to the few disagreements that annotators had above all about the grammar.
However, the observed agreement is high (90.63).

Table 1: Results of Biografix language by language
In the case of Catalan, we see that Biografix is not able to create as many sentences as information in
the original source (recall: 0.77) and this tendency occurs in the other languages as well. Precision at
performance goes down (0.53) due to added and lost information but grammatical precision is acceptable
(0.78). We think, that this is a quite satisfactory adaptation.
The results for French indicate that something went wrong. There is more than a way to express the
biographical information and, as expected, the performance goes down. The precision is very low (0.18)
due to the fact that a lot of information is lost and as sometime paraphrases do appear in the original
sentence, this fact implies grammatical error. Anyhow, the recall is acceptable (0.80) and that is a good
starting point for the further development of French version. The average of the obtained ? measures
is really low (0.39) and that is why having few instances Cohen?s kappa penalises the disagreement too
much.
The case of Galician is quite different. It is not stated in the guidelines how biographical data should
be written and the parentheticals we found are few (coverage: 43.00) and different from the Basque.
However, we wanted to try Biografix and what we see is, that, although its precision at performance is
really low (0.15), the created sentences are quite correct (0.62). We think the Galician Wikipedia should
be analysed thoroughly and then Biografix should be adjusted.
The German version of Biografix was able to simplify all the sentences found in the test-sample and
its recall is high (0.88). Its weak point is the precision at performance (0.60), as in other languages, due
to the fact that the second question of Prog is not satisfied. The sentence it creates are quite acceptable
(0.71) as well. Surprisingly, both linguists agreed in all the cases and questions. So, we conclude that
the German adaptation was successful.
Finally, in the case of the Spanish adaptation, we see that the precision is very low (0.33) since there
was an important information loss. However, the grammatical precision (0.67) is acceptable. Although
? is higher (0.52) than in other languages, observed agreement is not far from Basque (88.76). It is
remarkable as well that being Spanish a long time normalised language only the 85.00 % of the source
sentence are correct and that although there are other formats to express the biographical information the
coverage is absolute (100.00).
The main disagreement was found when evaluating the grammar and the punctuation due to different
criteria of the annotators. For some of them sentences without verb were correct because they considered
that there was an elided verb. In our opinion, as we are trying to simplify, we think that all the sentences
should have a finite verb. Annotators did not have to much trouble to answer the four Prog questions,
so we think that this is a good methodology, and, moreover, it makes easy to perform error analysis. We
want to point out that ? has not been the best measure but we have used it as we consider that it is a
standard to measure data reliability.
To conclude, we find that there is room to improve the versions in other languages, above all trying not
to lose information but the adaptation of Biografix has been a good starting point. In fact, the adaptation
has been quite satisfactory for German and Catalan, because they share the format with Basque but they
should be further analysed. As foreseen, the languages with different formats like Galician, Spanish and
French require a bigger analysis.

4.2 Extrinsic evaluation
To evaluate the performance of Biografix throughout another NLP advanced application, we used the web
application Seneko (Lopez-Gazpio and Maritxalar, 2013)
11
, the application of the chunk-based question
generation system for educational purposes presented in Aldabe et al. (2013). This kind of evaluation
was only performed for Basque.
We ran Seneko with the original sentences and the simplified sentences. The number of the generated
questions is presented in table 2. We break down the results on the basis of the case markers as well.
In agglutinative languages like Basque case markers are the morphemes that express the grammatical
functions.
Source file Total Absolutive Inessive Genitive Other
Original sentences 34 23 7 2 2
Simplified sentences 142 65 66 8 3
Table 2: Questions generated by Seneko using the original and the simplified sentences
Using as input the original sentences Seneko is able to create 34 questions, more or less a question
per sentence. 23 of them have been generated for the absolutive case, that is, for the subject and the
predicative, and only 7 of them have been generated for the inessive. Taking into account that we are
working with biographical information, this is a bad result because the inessive case in Basque is used
to express time and place relations. That is, the inessive is used to create questions with the question
words When and Where. On the other hand, using as source the simplified sentences, 65 questions have
been generated for the absolutive and 66 for the inessive. This way, we see that using Biografix?s output
Seneko has been able to generate questions about place and time expressions.
Next, in 11 and 12 we show an example of the questions generated by Seneko. In 11 we find that using
the original input it was only able to create a question, and it makes no sense but using the simplified text
(example 12) Seneko creates two correct questions.
(11) a. Source text: Eduardo Hughes Galeano (Montevideo, 1940ko irailaren 3a - ) Uruguaiko
kazetari eta idazlea da.
?Eduardo Hughes Galeano (Montevideo, 3rd of September, 1940 - ) is an Uruguayan jour-
nalist and writer.?
b. Generated question: Nor da Eduardo Hughes Galeano Montevideo 1940ko irailaren 3a?
?Who is Eduardo Hughes Galeano Montevideo 3rd of September, 1940??
(12) a. Simplified text: Eduardo Hughes Galeano Uruguaiko kazetari eta idazlea da. Eduardo
Galeano 1940ko irailaren 3an Montevideon jaio zen.
?Eduardo Hughes Galeano is an Uruguayan journalist and writer. Eduardo Hughes Galeano
was born the 3rd of September, 1940 in Montevideo.?
b. Generated questions: Nor jaio zen 1940ko irailaren 3an Montevideon? Non jaio zen Ed-
uardo Galeano 1940ko irailaren 3an?
?Who was born on the 3rd of September, 1940 in Montevideo? Where was born Eduardo
Hughes Galeano on the 3rd of September, 1940??
This way, we conclude that Biografix is an useful tool to improve the performance of question gener-
ation systems like Seneko.
5 Conclusion and future work
In this paper we have presented Biografix, a tool that detects parenthetical structures and simplifies
the biographical data in order to create new more readable sentences. Although Biografix has been
11
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/seneko/ (last accessed: March, 2014)
18
designed and developed for Basque, we have applied it to the parenthetical biographical information
written in other seven languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese.
The results of the evaluation show that the Basque version obtains very good results but the adaptations
should be further developed. Anyway, good results have been obtained for Catalan and German and
promising for Spanish and French. Besides, we have shown its validity through an extrinsic evaluation
with Seneko, a question generation system. These systems are important for the educational domain,
and the improvement Biografix offers is considerable. Although we have used Wikipedia to develop and
evaluate Biografix, it can be used for other kind of text with parenthetical biographical information.
For the future, we plan to continue analysing and implementing rules for other kind of parenthetical
structures like etymology, translations of named entities or mandates of relevant people. We also plan
to link the entities to the their articles in Wikipedia to offer additional information. Patterns could also
be improved using previously developed analysers or tools, but this way the splitting stage will become
language-dependent. Moreover, we cannot forget that this work is included in the main framework of
the TS system for Basque that we are developing and this is another step towards the main aim of getting
easier and more readable Basque texts.
