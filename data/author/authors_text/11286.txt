Abstract
This paper investigates the claim that a di-
alogue manager modelled as a Partially Ob-
servable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
can achieve improved robustness to noise
compared to conventional state-based dia-
logue managers. Using the Hidden Infor-
mation State (HIS) POMDP dialogue man-
ager as an exemplar, and an MDP-based dia-
logue manager as a baseline, evaluation results
are presented for both simulated and real dia-
logues in a Tourist Information Domain. The
results on the simulated data show that the
inherent ability to model uncertainty, allows
the POMDP model to exploit alternative hy-
potheses from the speech understanding sys-
tem. The results obtained from a user trial
show that the HIS system with a trained policy
performed significantly better than the MDP
baseline.
1 Introduction
Conventional spoken dialogue systems operate by
finding the most likely interpretation of each user
input, updating some internal representation of the
dialogue state and then outputting an appropriate re-
sponse. Error tolerance depends on using confidence
thresholds and where they fail, the dialogue manager
must resort to quite complex recovery procedures.
Such a system has no explicit mechanisms for rep-
resenting the inevitable uncertainties associated with
speech understanding or the ambiguities which natu-
rally arise in interpreting a user?s intentions. The re-
sult is a system that is inherently fragile, especially
in noisy conditions or where the user is unsure of
how to use the system.
It has been suggested that Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a nat-
ural framework for building spoken dialogue sys-
tems which can both model these uncertainties
and support policies which are robust to their ef-
fects (Young, 2002; Williams and Young, 2007a).
The key idea of the POMDP is that the underlying
dialogue state is hidden and dialogue management
policies must therefore be based not on a single state
estimate but on a distribution over all states.
Whilst POMDPs are attractive theoretically, in
practice, they are notoriously intractable for any-
thing other than small state/action spaces. Hence,
practical examples of their use were initially re-
stricted to very simple domains (Roy et al, 2000;
Zhang et al, 2001). More recently, however, a num-
ber of techniques have been suggested which do al-
low POMDPs to be scaled to handle real world tasks.
The two generic mechanisms which facilitate this
scaling are factoring the state space and perform-
ing policy optimisation in a reduced summary state
space (Williams and Young, 2007a; Williams and
Young, 2007b).
Based on these ideas, a number of real-world
POMDP-based systems have recently emerged. The
most complex entity which must be represented in
the state space is the user?s goal. In the Bayesian
Update of Dialogue State (BUDS) system, the user?s
goal is further factored into conditionally indepen-
dent slots. The resulting system is then modelled
as a dynamic Bayesian network (Thomson et al,
2008). A similar approach is also developed in
112
(Bui et al, 2007a; Bui et al, 2007b). An alterna-
tive approach taken in the Hidden Information State
(HIS) system is to retain a complete representation
of the user?s goal, but partition states into equiva-
lence classes and prune away very low probability
partitions (Young et al, 2007; Thomson et al, 2007;
Williams and Young, 2007b).
Whichever approach is taken, a key issue in a real
POMDP-based dialogue system is its ability to be
robust to noise and that is the issue that is addressed
in this paper. Using the HIS system as an exem-
plar, evaluation results are presented for a real-world
tourist information task using both simulated and
real users. The results show that a POMDP system
can learn noise robust policies and that N-best out-
puts from the speech understanding component can
be exploited to further improve robustness.
The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, in Sec-
tion 2 a brief overview of the HIS system is given.
Then in Section 3, various POMDP training regimes
are described and evaluated using a simulated user at
differing noise levels. Section 4 then presents results
from a trial in which users conducted various tasks
over a range of noise levels. Finally, in Section 5,
we discuss our results and present our conclusions.
2 The HIS System
2.1 Basic Principles
A POMDP-based dialogue system is shown in Fig-
ure 1 where sm denotes the (unobserved or hidden)
machine state which is factored into three compo-
nents: the last user act au, the user?s goal su and
the dialogue history sd. Since sm is unknown, at
each time-step the system computes a belief state
such that the probability of being in state sm given
belief state b is b(sm). Based on this current belief
state b, the machine selects an action am, receives
a reward r(sm, am), and transitions to a new (un-
observed) state s?m, where s?m depends only on sm
and am. The machine then receives an observation
o? consisting of an N-best list of hypothesised user
actions. Finally, the belief distribution b is updated
based on o? and am as follows:
b?(s?m) = kP (o?|s?m, am)
?
sm?Sm
P (s?m|am, sm)b(sm)
(1)
where k is a normalisation constant (Kaelbling et al,
1998). The first term on the RHS of (1) is called the
observation model and the term inside the summa-
tion is called the transition model. Maintaining this
belief state as the dialogue evolves is called belief
monitoring.

At each time step t, the machine receives a reward
r(bt, am,t) based on the current belief state bt and the
selected action am,t. Each action am,t is determined
by a policy ?(bt) and building a POMDP system in-
volves finding the policy ?? which maximises the
discounted sum R of the rewards
R =

?tr(bt, am,t) (2)
where ?t is a discount coefficient.
2.2 Probability Models
In the HIS system, user goals are partitioned and
initially, all states su ? Su are regarded as being
equally likely and they are placed in a single par-
tition p0. As the dialogue progresses, user inputs
result in changing beliefs and this root partition is
repeatedly split into smaller partitions. This split-
ting is binary, i.e. p ? {p?, p ? p?} with probability
P (p?|p). By replacing sm by its factors (su, au, sd)
and making reasonable independence assumptions,
it can be shown (Young et al, 2007) that in parti-
113
tioned form (1) becomes

(3)
where p is the parent of p?.
In this equation, the observation model is approx-
imated by the normalised distribution of confidence
measures output by the speech recognition system.
The user action model allows the observation prob-
ability that is conditioned on a?u to be scaled by the
probability that the user would speak a?u given the
partition p? and the last system prompt am. In the
current implementation of the HIS system, user dia-
logue acts take the form act(a = v) where act is the
dialogue type, a is an attribute and v is its value [for
example, request(food=Chinese)]. The user action
model is then approximated by
P (a?u|p?, am) ? P (T (a?u)|T (am))P (M(a?u)|p?)
(4)
where T (?) denotes the type of the dialogue act
and M(?) denotes whether or not the dialogue act
matches the current partition p?. The dialogue
model is a deterministic encoding based on a simple
grounding model. It yields probability one when the
updated dialogue hypothesis (i.e., a specific combi-
nation of p?, a?u, sd and am) is consistent with the
history and zero otherwise.
2.3 Policy Representation
Policy representation in POMDP-systems is non-
trivial since each action depends on a complex prob-
ability distribution. One of the simplest approaches
to dealing with this problem is to discretise the state
space and then associate an action with each dis-
crete grid point. To reduce quantisation errors, the
HIS model first maps belief distributions into a re-
duced summary space before quantising. This sum-
mary space consists of the probability of the top
two hypotheses plus some status variables and the
user act type associated with the top distribution.
Quantisation is then performed using a simple dis-
tance metric to find the nearest grid point. Ac-
tions in summary space refer specifically to the top
two hypotheses, and unlike actions in master space,
they are limited to a small finite set: greet, ask, ex-
plicit confirm, implicit confirm, select confirm, of-
fer, inform, find alternative, query more, goodbye.
A simple heuristic is then used to map the selected
next system action back into the full master belief
space.

Figure 2: Overview of the HIS system dialogue cycle
The dialogue manager is able to support nega-
tions, denials and requests for alternatives. When the
selected summary action is to offer the user a venue,
the summary-to-master space mapping heuristics
will normally offer a venue consistent with the most
likely user goal hypothesis. If this hypothesis is then
rejected its belief is substantially reduced and it will
no longer be the top-ranking hypothesis. If the next
system action is to make an alternative offer, then
the new top-ranking hypothesis may not be appro-
priate. For example, if an expensive French restau-
rant near the river had been offered and the user asks
for one nearer the centre of town, any alternative of-
fered should still include the user?s confirmed de-
sire for an expensive French restaurant. To ensure
this, all of the grounded features from the rejected
hypothesis are extracted and all user goal hypothe-
ses are scanned starting at the most likely until an
alternative is found that matches the grounded fea-
tures. For the current turn only, the summary-to-
master space heuristics then treat this hypothesis as
if it was the top-ranking one. If the system then of-
fers a venue based on this hypothesis, and the user
accepts it, then, since system outputs are appended
to user inputs for the purpose of belief updating, the
114
alternative hypothesis will move to the top, or near
the top, of the ranked hypothesis list. The dialogue
then typically continues with its focus on the newly
offered alternative venue.
2.4 Summary of Operation
To summarise, the overall processing performed by
the HIS system in a single dialogue turn (i.e. one cy-
cle of system output and user response) is as shown
in Figure 2. Each user utterance is decoded into an
N-best list of dialogue acts. Each incoming act plus
the previous system act are matched against the for-
est of user goals and partitions are split as needed.
Each user act au is then duplicated and bound to
each partition p. Each partition will also have a
set of dialogue histories sd associated with it. The
combination of each p, au and updated sd forms a
new dialogue hypothesis hk whose beliefs are eval-
uated using (3). Once all dialogue hypotheses have
been evaluated and any duplicates merged, the mas-
ter belief state b is mapped into summary space b?
and the nearest policy belief point is found. The as-
sociated summary space machine action a?m is then
heuristically mapped back to master space and the
machine?s actual response am is output. The cycle
then repeats until the user?s goal is satisfied.
3 Training and Evaluation with a
Simulated User
3.1 Policy optimisation
Policy optimisation is performed in the discrete
summary space described in the previous section us-
ing on-line batch ?-greedy policy iteration. Given
an existing policy ?, dialogs are executed and ma-
chine actions generated according to ? except that
with probability ? a random action is generated. The
system maintains a set of belief points {b?i}. At each
turn in training, the nearest stored belief point b?k to
b? is located using a distance measure. If the distance
is greater than some threshold, b? is added to the set
of stored belief points. The sequence of points b?k
traversed in each dialogue is stored in a list. As-
sociated with each b?i is a function Q(b?i, a?m) whose
value is the expected total reward obtained by choos-
ing summary action a?m from state b?i. At the end
of each dialogue, the total reward is calculated and
added to an accumulator for each point in the list,
discounted by ? at each step. On completion of a
batch of dialogs, the Q values are updated accord-
ing to the accumulated rewards, and the policy up-
dated by choosing the action which maximises each
Q value. The whole process is then repeated until
the policy stabilises.
In our experiments, ? was fixed at 0.1 and ? was
fixed at 0.95. The reward function used attempted
to encourage short successful dialogues by assign-
ing +20 for a successful dialogue and ?1 for each
dialogue turn.
3.2 User Simulation
To train a policy, a user simulator is used to gen-
erate responses to system actions. It has two main
components: a User Goal and a User Agenda. At
the start of each dialogue, the goal is randomly
initialised with requests such as ?name?, ?addr?,
?phone? and constraints such as ?type=restaurant?,
?food=Chinese?, etc. The agenda stores the di-
alogue acts needed to elicit this information in a
stack-like structure which enables it to temporarily
store actions when another action of higher priority
needs to be issued first. This enables the simulator
to refer to previous dialogue turns at a later point. To
generate a wide spread of realistic dialogs, the sim-
ulator reacts wherever possible with varying levels
of patience and arbitrariness. In addition, the sim-
ulator will relax its constraints when its initial goal
cannot be satisfied. This allows the dialogue man-
ager to learn negotiation-type dialogues where only
an approximate solution to the user?s goal exists.
Speech understanding errors are simulated at the di-
alogue act level using confusion matrices trained on
labelled dialogue data (Schatzmann et al, 2007).
3.3 Training and Evaluation
When training a system to operate robustly in noisy
conditions, a variety of strategies are possible. For
example, the system can be trained only on noise-
free interactions, it can be trained on increasing lev-
els of noise or it can be trained on a high noise level
from the outset. A related issue concerns the gener-
ation of grid points and the number of training itera-
tions to perform. For example, allowing a very large
number of points leads to poor performance due to
over-fitting of the training data. Conversely, having
too few point leads to poor performance due to a lack
115
of discrimination in its dialogue strategies.
After some experimentation, the following train-
ing schedule was adopted. Training starts in a
noise free environment using a small number of grid
points and it continues until the performance of the
policy levels off. The resulting policy is then taken
as an initial policy for the next stage where the noise
level is increased, the number of grid points is ex-
panded and the number of iterations is increased.
This process is repeated until the highest noise level
is reached. This approach was motivated by the ob-
servation that a key factor in effective reinforcement
learning is the balance between exploration and ex-
ploitation. In POMDP policy optimisation which
uses dynamically allocated grid points, maintaining
this balance is crucial. In our case, the noise intro-
duced by the simulator is used as an implicit mech-
anism for increasing the exploration. Each time ex-
ploration is increased, the areas of state-space that
will be visited will also increase and hence the num-
ber of available grid points must also be increased.
At the same time, the number of iterations must be
increased to ensure that all points are visited a suf-
ficient number of times. In practice we found that
around 750 to 1000 grid points was sufficient and
the total number of simulated dialogues needed for
training was around 100,000.
A second issue when training in noisy conditions
is whether to train on just the 1-best output from the
simulator or train on the N-best outputs. A limit-
ing factor here is that the computation required for
N-best training is significantly increased since the
rate of partition generation in the HIS model in-
creases exponentially with N. In preliminary tests,
it was found that when training with 1-best outputs,
there was little difference between policies trained
entirely in no noise and policies trained on increas-
ing noise as described above. However, policies
trained on 2-best using the incremental strategy did
exhibit increased robustness to noise. To illustrate
this, Figures 3 and 4 show the average dialogue suc-
cess rates and rewards for 3 different policies, all
trained on 2-best: a hand-crafted policy (hdc), a pol-
icy trained on noise-free conditions (noise free) and
a policy trained using the incremental scheme de-
scribed above (increm). Each policy was tested us-
ing 2-best output from the simulator across a range
of error rates. In addition, the noise-free policy was
also tested on 1-best output.
Figure 3: Average simulated dialogue success rate as a
function of error rate for a hand-crafted (hdc), noise-free
and incrementally trained (increm) policy.
Figure 4: Average simulated dialogue reward as a func-
tion of error rate for a hand-crafted (hdc), noise-free and
incrementally trained (increm) policy.
As can be seen, both the trained policies improve
significantly on the hand-crafted policies. Further-
more, although the average rewards are all broadly
similar, the success rate of the incrementally trained
policy is significantly better at higher error rates.
Hence, this latter policy was selected for the user
trial described next.
4 Evaluation via a User Trial
The HIS-POMDP policy (HIS-TRA) that was incre-
mentally trained on the simulated user using 2-best
lists was tested in a user trial together with a hand-
crafted HIS-POMDP policy (HIS-HDC). The strat-
egy used by the latter was to first check the most
likely hypothesis. If it contains sufficient grounded
116
keys to match 1 to 3 database entities, then offer is
selected. If any part of the hypothesis is inconsis-
tent or the user has explicitly asked for another sug-
gestion, then find alternative action is selected. If
the user has asked for information about an offered
entity then inform is selected. Otherwise, an un-
grounded component of the top hypothesis is identi-
fied and depending on the belief, one of the confirm
actions is selected.
In addition, an MDP-based dialogue manager de-
veloped for earlier trials (Schatzmann, 2008) was
also tested. Since considerable effort has been put in
optimising this system, it serves as a strong baseline
for comparison. Again, both a trained policy (MDP-
TRA) and a hand-crafted policy (MDP-HDC) were
tested.
4.1 System setup and confidence scoring
The dialogue system consisted of an ATK-based
speech recogniser, a Phoenix-based semantic parser,
the dialogue manager and a diphone based speech
synthesiser. The semantic parser uses simple phrasal
grammar rules to extract the dialogue act type and a
list of attribute/value pairs from each utterance.
In a POMDP-based dialogue system, accurate
belief-updating is very sensitive to the confidence
scores assigned to each user dialogue act. Ideally
these should provide a measure of the probability of
the decoded act given the true user act. In the evalu-
ation system, the recogniser generates a 10-best list
of hypotheses at each turn along with a compact con-
fusion network which is used to compute the infer-
ence evidence for each hypothesis. The latter is de-
fined as the sum of the log-likelihoods of each arc
in the confusion network and when exponentiated
and renormalised this gives a simple estimate of the
probability of each hypothesised utterance. Each ut-
terance in the 10-best list is passed to the semantic
parser. Equivalent dialogue acts output by the parser
are then grouped together and the dialogue act for
each group is then assigned the sum of the sentence-
level probabilities as its confidence score.
4.2 Trial setup
For the trial itself, 36 subjects were recruited (all
British native speakers, 18 male, 18 female). Each
subject was asked to imagine himself to be a tourist
in a fictitious town called Jasonville and try to find
particular hotels, bars, or restaurants in that town.
Each subject was asked to complete a set of pre-
defined tasks where each task involved finding the
name of a venue satisfying a set of constraints such
as food type is Chinese, price-range is cheap, etc.,
and getting the value of one or more additional at-
tributes of that venue such as the address or the
phone number.
For each task, subjects were given a scenario to
read and were then asked to solve the task via a di-
alogue with the system. The tasks set could either
have one solution, several solutions, or no solution
at all in the database. In cases where a subject found
that there was no matching venue for the given task,
he/she was allowed to try and find an alternative
venue by relaxing one or more of the constraints.
In addition, subjects had to perform each task at
one of three possible noise levels. These levels cor-
respond to signal/noise ratios (SNRs) of 35.3 dB
(low noise), 10.2 dB (medium noise), or 3.3 dB
(high noise). The noise was artificially generated
and mixed with the microphone signal, in addition
it was fed into the subject?s headphones so that they
were aware of the noisy conditions.
An instructor was present at all times to indicate
to the subject which task description to follow, and
to start the right system with the appropriate noise-
level. Each subject performed an equal number of
tasks for each system (3 tasks), noise level (6 tasks)
and solution type (6 tasks for each of the types 0, 1,
or multiple solutions). Also, each subject performed
one task for all combinations of system and noise
level. Overall, each combination of system, noise
level, and solution type was used in an equal number
of dialogues.
4.3 Results
In Table 1, some general statistics of the corpus re-
sulting from the trial are given. The semantic error
rate is based on substitutions, insertions and dele-
tions errors on semantic items. When tested after the
trial on the transcribed user utterances, the semantic
error rate was 4.1% whereas the semantic error rate
on the ASR input was 25.2%. This means that 84%
of the error rate was due to the ASR.

line systems. For the success rates, also the stan-
dard deviation (std.dev) is given, assuming a bino-
mial distribution. The success rate is the percentage
of successfully completed dialogues. A task is con-
sidered to be fully completed when the user is able to
find the venue he is looking for and get al the addi-
tional information he asked for; if the task has no so-
lution and the system indicates to the user no venue
could be found, this also counts as full completion.
A task is considered to be partially completed when
only the correct venue has been given. The results on
partial completion are given in Table 2, and the re-
sults on full completion in Table 3. To mirror the re-
ward function used in training, the performance for
each dialogue is computed by assigning a reward of
20 points for full completion and subtracting 1 point
for the number of turns up until a successful recom-
mendation (i.e., partial completion).

The results show that the trained HIS dialogue
manager significantly outperforms both MDP based
dialogue managers. For success rate on partial com-
pletion, both HIS systems perform better than the
MDP systems.
4.3.1 Subjective Results
In the user trial, the subjects were also asked for
a subjective judgement of the systems. After com-
pleting each task, the subjects were asked whether
they had found the information they were looking
for (yes/no). They were also asked to give a score
on a scale from 1 to 5 (best) on how natural/intuitive
they thought the dialogue was. Table 4 shows the
results for the 4 systems used. The performance of
the HIS systems is similar to the MDP systems, with
a slightly higher success rate for the trained one and
a slightly lower score for the handcrafted one.

5 Conclusions
This paper has described recent work in training a
POMDP-based dialogue manager to exploit the ad-
ditional information available from a speech under-
standing system which can generate ranked lists of
hypotheses. Following a brief overview of the Hid-
den Information State dialogue manager and pol-
icy optimisation using a user simulator, results have
been given for both simulated user and real user di-
alogues conducted at a variety of noise levels.
The user simulation results have shown that al-
though the rewards are similar, training with 2-best
rather than 1-best outputs from the user simulator
yields better success rates at high noise levels. In
view of this result, we would have liked to inves-
tigate training on longer N-best lists, but currently
computational constraints prevent this. We hope in
the future to address this issue by developing more
efficient state partitioning strategies for the HIS sys-
tem.
118
The overall results on real data collected from the
user trial clearly indicate increased robustness by the
HIS system. We would have liked to be able to
plot performance and success scores as a function
of noise level or speech understanding error rate,
but there is great variability in these kinds of com-
plex real-world dialogues and it transpired that the
trial data was insufficient to enable any statistically
meaningful presentation of this form. We estimate
that we need at least an order of magnitude more
trial data to properly investigate the behaviour of
such systems as a function of noise level. The trial
described here, including transcription and analysis
consumed about 30 man-days of effort. Increasing
this by a factor of 10 or more is not therefore an
option for us, and clearly an alternative approach is
needed.
We have also reported results of subjective suc-
cess rate and opinion scores based on data obtained
from subjects after each trial. The results were only
weakly correlated with the measured performance
and success rates. We believe that this is partly due
to confusion as to what constituted success in the
minds of the subjects. This suggests that for subjec-
tive results to be meaningful, measurements such as
these will only be really useful if made on live sys-
tems where users have a real rather than imagined
information need. The use of live systems would
also alleviate the data sparsity problem noted earlier.
Finally and in conclusion, we believe that despite
the difficulties noted above, the results reported in
this paper represent a first step towards establish-
ing the POMDP as a viable framework for develop-
ing spoken dialogue systems which are significantly
more robust to noisy operating conditions than con-
ventional state-based systems.

Abstract
In real-world applications, modelling di-
alogue as a POMDP requires the use of
a summary space for the dialogue state
representation to ensure tractability. Sub-
optimal estimation of the value func-
tion governing the selection of system re-
sponses can then be obtained using a grid-
based approach on the belief space. In
this work, the Monte-Carlo control tech-
nique is extended so as to reduce training
over-fitting and to improve robustness to
semantic noise in the user input. This tech-
nique uses a database of belief vector pro-
totypes to choose the optimal system ac-
tion. A locally weighted k-nearest neigh-
bor scheme is introduced to smooth the de-
cision process by interpolating the value
function, resulting in higher user simula-
tion performance.
1 Introduction
In the last decade dialogue modelling as a Partially
Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
has been proposed as a convenient way to improve
spoken dialogue systems (SDS) trainability, nat-
uralness and robustness to input errors (Young et
al., 2009). The POMDP framework models dia-
logue flow as a sequence of unobserved dialogue
states following stochastic moves, and provides a
principled way to model uncertainty.
However, to deal with uncertainty, POMDPs
maintain distributions over all possible states. But
then training an optimal policy is an NP hard
problem and thus not tractable for any non-trivial
application. In recent works this issue is ad-
dressed by mapping the dialog state representation
?Fabrice Lefe`vre is currently on leave from the Univer-
sity of Avignon, France.
space (the master space) into a smaller summary
space (Williams and Young, 2007). Even though
optimal policies remain out of reach, sub-optimal
solutions can be found by means of grid-based al-
gorithms.
Within the Hidden Information State (HIS)
framework (Young et al, 2009), policies are rep-
resented by a set of grid points in the summary be-
lief space. Beliefs in master space are first mapped
into summary space and then mapped into a sum-
mary action via the dialogue policy. The resulting
summary action is then mapped back into master
space and output to the user.
Methods which support interpolation between
points are generally required to scale well to large
state spaces (Pineau et al, 2003). In the current
version of the HIS framework, the policy chooses
the system action by associating each new belief
point with the single, closest, grid point. In the
present work, a k-nearest neighbour extension is
evaluated in which the policy decision is based on
a locally weighted regression over a subset of rep-
resentative grid points. This method thus lies be-
tween a strictly grid-based and a point-based value
iteration approach as it interpolates the value func-
tion around the queried belief point. It thus re-
duces the policy?s dependency on the belief grid
point selection and increases robustness to input
noise.
The next section gives an overview of the
CUED HIS POMDP dialogue system which we
extended for our experiments. In Section 3, the
grid-based approach to policy optimisation is in-
troduced followed by a presentation of the k-
nn Monte-Carlo policy optimization in Section 4,
along with an evaluation on a simulated user.

2 The CUED Spoken Dialogue System
2.1 System Architecture
The CUED HIS-based dialogue system pipelines
five modules: the ATK speech recogniser, an
SVM-based semantic tuple classifier, a POMDP
dialogue manager, a natural language generator,
and an HMM-based speech synthesiser. During
an interaction with the system, the user?s speech
is first decoded by the recogniser and an N-best
list of hypotheses is sent to the semantic classifier.
In turn the semantic classifier outputs an N-best
list of user dialogue acts. A dialogue act is a se-
mantic representation of the user action headed by
the user intention (such as inform, request,
etc) followed by a list of items (slot-value pairs
such as type=hotel, area=east etc). The
N-best list of dialogue acts is used by the dialogue
manager to update the dialogue state. Based on
the state hypotheses and the policy, a machine ac-
tion is determined, again in the form of a dialogue
act. The natural language generator translates the
machine action into a sentence, finally converted
into speech by the HMM synthesiser. The dia-
logue system is currently developed for a tourist
information domain (Towninfo). It is worth not-
ing that the dialogue manager does not contain any
domain-specific knowledge.
2.2 HIS Dialogue Manager
The unobserved dialogue state of the HIS dialogue
manager consists of the user goal, the dialogue his-
tory and the user action. The user goal is repre-
sented by a partition which is a tree structure built
according to the domain ontology. The nodes in
the partition consist mainly of slots and values.
When querying the venue database using the par-
tition, a set of matching entities can be produced.
The dialogue history consists of the grounding
states of the nodes in the partition, generated us-
ing a finite state automaton and the previous user
and system action. A hypothesis in the HIS ap-
proach is then a triple combining a partition, a user
action and the respective set of grounding states.
The distribution over all hypotheses is maintained
throughout the dialogue (belief state monitoring).
Considering the ontology size for any real-world
problem, the so-defined state space is too large for
any POMDP learning algorithm. Hence to obtain a
tractable policy, the state/action space needs to be
reduced to a smaller scale summary space. The set
of possible machine dialogue acts is also reduced
in summary space. This is mainly achieved by re-

Abstract
Most previous work on trainable language
generation has focused on two paradigms:
(a) using a statistical model to rank a
set of generated utterances, or (b) using
statistics to inform the generation deci-
sion process. Both approaches rely on
the existence of a handcrafted generator,
which limits their scalability to new do-
mains. This paper presents BAGEL, a sta-
tistical language generator which uses dy-
namic Bayesian networks to learn from
semantically-aligned data produced by 42
untrained annotators. A human evalua-
tion shows that BAGEL can generate nat-
ural and informative utterances from un-
seen inputs in the information presentation
domain. Additionally, generation perfor-
mance on sparse datasets is improved sig-
nificantly by using certainty-based active
learning, yielding ratings close to the hu-
man gold standard with a fraction of the
data.
1 Introduction
The field of natural language generation (NLG) is
one of the last areas of computational linguistics to
embrace statistical methods. Over the past decade,
statistical NLG has followed two lines of research.
The first one, pioneered by Langkilde and Knight
(1998), introduces statistics in the generation pro-
cess by training a model which reranks candi-
date outputs of a handcrafted generator. While
their HALOGEN system uses an n-gram language
model trained on news articles, other systems have
used hierarchical syntactic models (Bangalore and
Rambow, 2000), models trained on user ratings of
?This research was partly funded by the UK EPSRC un-
der grant agreement EP/F013930/1 and funded by the EU
FP7 Programme under grant agreement 216594 (CLASSiC
project: www.classic-project.org).
utterance quality (Walker et al, 2002), or align-
ment models trained on speaker-specific corpora
(Isard et al, 2006).
A second line of research has focused on intro-
ducing statistics at the generation decision level,
by training models that find the set of genera-
tion parameters maximising an objective function,
e.g. producing a target linguistic style (Paiva and
Evans, 2005; Mairesse and Walker, 2008), gener-
ating the most likely context-free derivations given
a corpus (Belz, 2008), or maximising the expected
reward using reinforcement learning (Rieser and
Lemon, 2009). While such methods do not suffer
from the computational cost of an overgeneration
phase, they still require a handcrafted generator to
define the generation decision space within which
statistics can be used to find an optimal solution.
This paper presents BAGEL (Bayesian networks
for generation using active learning), an NLG sys-
tem that can be fully trained from aligned data.
While the main requirement of the generator is to
produce natural utterances within a dialogue sys-
tem domain, a second objective is to minimise the
overall development effort. In this regard, a major
advantage of data-driven methods is the shift of
the effort from model design and implementation
to data annotation. In the case of NLG systems,
learning to produce paraphrases can be facilitated
by collecting data from a large sample of annota-
tors. Our meaning representation should therefore
(a) be intuitive enough to be understood by un-
trained annotators, and (b) provide useful gener-
alisation properties for generating unseen inputs.
Section 2 describes BAGEL?s meaning represen-
tation, which satisfies both requirements. Sec-
tion 3 then details how our meaning representation
is mapped to a phrase sequence, using a dynamic
Bayesian network with backoff smoothing.
Within a given domain, the same semantic
concept can occur in different utterances. Sec-
tion 4 details how BAGEL exploits this redundancy
1552
to improve generation performance on sparse
datasets, by guiding the data collection process
using certainty-based active learning (Lewis and
Catlett, 1994). We train BAGEL in the informa-
tion presentation domain, from a corpus of utter-
ances produced by 42 untrained annotators (see
Section 5.1). An automated evaluation metric is
used to compare preliminary model and training
configurations in Section 5.2, while Section 5.3
shows that the resulting system produces natural
and informative utterances, according to 18 hu-
man judges. Finally, our human evaluation shows
that training using active learning significantly im-
proves generation performance on sparse datasets,
yielding results close to the human gold standard
using a fraction of the data.
2 Phrase-based generation from
semantic stacks
BAGEL uses a stack-based semantic representa-
tion to constrain the sequence of semantic con-
cepts to be searched. This representation can be
seen as a linearised semantic tree similar to the
one previously used for natural language under-
standing in the Hidden Vector State model (He
and Young, 2005). A stack representation provides
useful generalisation properties (see Section 3.1),
while the resulting stack sequences are relatively
easy to align (see Section 5.1). In the context of
dialogue systems, Table 1 illustrates how the input
dialogue act is first mapped to a set of stacks of
semantic concepts, and then aligned with a word
sequence. The bottom concept in the stack will
typically be a dialogue act type, e.g. an utterance
providing information about the object under dis-
cussion (inform) or specifying that the request
of the user cannot be met (reject). Other con-
cepts include attributes of that object (e.g., food,
area), values for those attributes (e.g., Chinese,
riverside), as well as special symbols for negat-
ing underlying concepts (e.g., not) or specifying
that they are irrelevant (e.g., dontcare).
The generator?s goal is thus finding the
most likely realisation given an unordered
set of mandatory semantic stacks Sm derived
from the input dialogue act. For example,
s =inform(area(centre)) is a mandatory stack
associated with the dialogue act in Table 1 (frame
8). While mandatory stacks must all be conveyed
in the output realisation, Sm does not contain the
optional intermediary stacks Si that can refer to
(a) general attributes of the object under discus-
sion (e.g., inform(area) in Table 1), or (b) to
concepts that are not in the input at all, which are
associated with the singleton stack inform (e.g.,
phrases expressing the dialogue act type, or clause
aggregation operations). For example, the stack
sequence in Table 1 contains 3 intermediary stacks
for t = 2, 5 and 7.
BAGEL?s granularity is defined by the semantic
annotation in the training data, rather than external
linguistic knowledge about what constitutes a unit
of meaning, i.e. contiguous words belonging to
the same semantic stack are modelled as an atomic
observation unit or phrase.1 In contrast with word-
level models, a major advantage of phrase-based
generation models is that they can model long-
range dependencies and domain-specific idiomatic
phrases with fewer parameters.
3 Dynamic Bayesian networks for NLG
Dynamic Bayesian networks have been used suc-
cessfully for speech recognition, natural language
understanding, dialogue management and text-to-
speech synthesis (Rabiner, 1989; He and Young,
2005; Lefe`vre, 2006; Thomson and Young, 2010;
Tokuda et al, 2000). Such models provide a
principled framework for predicting elements in a
large structured space, such as required for non-
trivial NLG tasks. Additionally, their probabilistic
nature makes them suitable for modelling linguis-
tic variation, i.e. there can be multiple valid para-
phrases for a given input.
BAGEL models the generation task as finding
the most likely sequence of realisation phrases
R? = (r1...rL) given an unordered set of manda-
tory semantic stacks Sm, with |Sm| ? L. BAGEL
must thus derive the optimal sequence of semantic
stacks S? that will appear in the utterance given
Sm, i.e. by inserting intermediary stacks if needed
and by performing content ordering. Any num-
ber of intermediary stacks can be inserted between
two consecutive mandatory stacks, as long as all
their concepts are included in either the previous
or following mandatory stack, and as long as each
stack transition leads to a different stack (see ex-
ample in Table 1). Let us define the set of possi-
ble stack sequences matching these constraints as
Seq(Sm) ? {S = (s1...sL) s.t. st ? Sm ? Si}.
We propose a model which estimates the dis-

P (R|S)P (S|Sm) (1)
Inference over the model defined in (1) requires
the decoding algorithm to consider all possible or-
derings over Seq(Sm) together with all possible
realisations, which is intractable for non-trivial do-
mains. We thus make the additional assumption
that the most likely sequence of semantic stacks
S? given Sm is the one yielding the optimal reali-
sation phrase sequence:
P (R|Sm) ? P (R|S
?)P (S?|Sm) (2)
with S? = argmax
S?Seq(Sm)
P (S|Sm) (3)
The semantic stacks are therefore decoded first
using the model in Fig. 1 to solve the argmax
in (3). The decoded stack sequence S? is then
treated as observed in the realisation phase, in
which the model in Fig. 2 is used to find the real-
isation phrase sequence R? maximising P (R|S?)
over all phrase sequences of length L = |S?| in
our vocabulary:
R? = argmax
R=(r1...rL)

torise our model by conditioning the realisation

stacks. The semantic stack st at time t is assumed

While dynamic Bayesian networks typically
take sequential inputs, mapping a set of seman-
tic stacks to a sequence of phrases is achieved
by keeping track of the mandatory stacks that
were visited in the current sequence (see stack set
tracker variable in Fig. 1), and pruning any se-
quence that has not included all mandatory input
stacks on reaching the final frame (see observed
stack set validator variable in Fig. 1). Since the
number of intermediary stacks is not known at de-
coding time, the network is unrolled for a fixed
number of frames T defining the maximum num-
ber of phrases that can be generated (e.g., T =
50). The end of the stack sequence is then deter-
mined by a special end symbol, which can only
be emitted within the T frames once all mandatory
stacks have been visited. The probability of the re-
sulting utterance is thus computed over all frames
up to the end symbol, which determines the length
1554
L of S? and R?. While the decoding constraints
enforce that L > |Sm|, the search for S? requires
comparing sequences of different lengths. A con-
sequence is that shorter sequences containing only
mandatory stacks are likely to be favoured. While
future work should investigate length normalisa-
tion strategies, we find that the learned transition
probabilities are skewed enough to favour stack
sequences including intermediary stacks.
Once the topology and the decoding constraints
of the network have been defined, any inference al-
gorithm can be used to search for S? and R?. We
use the junction tree algorithm implemented in the
Graphical Model ToolKit (GMTK) for our exper-
iments (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002), however both
problems can be solved using a standard Viterbi
search given the appropriate state representation.
In terms of computational complexity, it is impor-
tant to note that the number of stack sequences
Seq(Sm) to search over increases exponentially
with the number of input mandatory stacks. Nev-
ertheless, we find that real-time performance can
be achieved by pruning low probability sequences,
without affecting the quality of the solution.
3.1 Generalisation to unseen semantic stacks
In order to generalise to semantic stacks which
have not been observed during training, the re-
alisation phrase r is made dependent on under-
specified stack configurations, i.e. the tail l
and the head h of the stack. For example, the
last stack in Table 1 is associated with the head
centre and the tail inform(area). As a re-
sult, BAGEL assigns non-zero probabilities to re-
alisation phrases in unseen semantic contexts, by
backing off to the head and the tail of the stack.
A consequence is that BAGEL?s lexical realisa-
tion can generalise across contexts. For exam-
ple, if reject(area(centre)) was never ob-
served at training time, P (r = centre of town|s =
reject(area(centre))) will be estimated by
backing off to P (r = centre of town|h =
centre). BAGEL can thus generate ?there are
no venues in the centre of town? if the phrase
?centre of town? was associated with the con-
cept centre in a different context, such as
inform(area(centre)). The final realisation
model is illustrated in Fig. 2:

Conditional probability distributions are repre-
sented as factored language models smoothed us-
ing Witten-Bell interpolated backoff smoothing
(Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003), according to the
backoff graphs in Fig. 3. Variables which are the
furthest away in time are dropped first, and par-
tial stack variables are dropped last as they are ob-
served the most.
It is important to note that generating unseen se-
mantic stacks requires all possible mandatory se-
mantic stacks in the target domain to be prede-
fined, in order for all stack unigrams to be assigned
a smoothed non-zero probability.
3.2 High cardinality concept abstraction
While one should expect a trainable generator
to learn multiple lexical realisations for low-
cardinality semantic concepts, learning lexical
realisations for high-cardinality database entries
(e.g., proper names) would increase the number of
model parameters prohibitively. We thus divide
pre-terminal concepts in the semantic stacks into
two types: (a) enumerable attributes whose val-
ues are associated with distinct semantic stacks in
1555
our model (e.g., inform(pricerange(cheap))),
and (b) non-enumerable attributes whose values
are replaced by a generic symbol before train-
ing in both the utterance and the semantic stack
(e.g., inform(name(X)). These symbolic values
are then replaced in the surface realisation by the
corresponding value in the input specification. A
consequence is that our model can only learn syn-
onymous lexical realisations for enumerable at-
tributes.
4 Certainty-based active learning
A major issue with trainable NLG systems is the
lack of availability of domain-specific data. It is
therefore essential to produce NLG models that
minimise the data annotation cost.
BAGEL supports the optimisation of the data
collection process through active learning, in
which the next semantic input to annotate is de-
termined by the current model. The probabilis-
tic nature of BAGEL allows the use of certainty-
based active learning (Lewis and Catlett, 1994),
by querying the k semantic inputs for which the
model is the least certain about its output real-
isation. Given a finite semantic input space I
representing all possible dialogue acts in our do-
main (i.e., the set of all sets of mandatory seman-
tic stacks Sm), BAGEL?s active learning training
process iterates over the following steps:
1. Generate an utterance for each semantic input Sm ? I
using the current model.2
2. Annotate the k semantic inputs {S1m...S
k
m} yielding
the lowest realisation probability, i.e. for q ? (1..k)
Sqm = argmin
Sm?I\{S1m...S
q?1
m }
(max
R
P (R|Sm)) (9)
with P (R|Sm) defined in (2).
3. Retrain the model with the additional k data points.
The number of utterances to be queried k should
depend on the flexibility of the annotators and the
time required for generating all possible utterances
in the domain.
5 Experimental method
BAGEL?s factored language models are trained us-
ing the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), and de-
coding is performed using GMTK?s junction tree
inference algorithm (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002).
2Sampling methods can be used if I is infinite or too
large.
Since each active learning iteration requires gen-
erating all training utterances in our domain, they
are generated using a larger clique pruning thresh-
old than the test utterances used for evaluation.
5.1 Corpus collection
We train BAGEL in the context of a dialogue
system providing information about restaurants
in Cambridge. The domain contains two dia-
logue act types: (a) inform: presenting infor-
mation about a restaurant (see Table 1), and (b)
reject: informing that the user?s constraints can-
not be met (e.g., ?There is no cheap restaurant
in the centre?). Our domain contains 8 restau-
rant attributes: name, food, near, pricerange,
postcode, phone, address, and area, out of
which food, pricerange, and area are treated
as enumerable.3 Our input semantic space is ap-
proximated by the set of information presentation
dialogue acts produced over 20,000 simulated di-
alogues between our statistical dialogue manager
(Young et al, 2010) and an agenda-based user
simulator (Schatzmann et al, 2007), which results
in 202 unique dialogue acts after replacing non-
enumerable values by a generic symbol. Each di-
alogue act contains an average of 4.48 mandatory
semantic stacks.
As one of our objectives is to test whether
BAGEL can learn from data provided by a large
sample of untrained annotators, we collected a
corpus of semantically-aligned utterances using
Amazon?s Mechanical Turk data collection ser-
vice. A crucial aspect of data collection for
NLG is to ensure that the annotators under-
stand the meaning of the semantics to be con-
veyed. Annotators were first asked to provide
an utterance matching an abstract description
of the dialogue act, regardless of the order in
which the constraints are presented (e.g., Offer
the venue Taj Mahal and provide the information
type(restaurant), area(riverside), food(Indian),
near(The Red Lion)). The order of the constraints
in the description was randomised to reduce the
effect of priming. The annotators were then asked
to align the attributes (e.g., Indicate the region of
the utterance related to the concept ?area?), and
the attribute values (e.g., Indicate only the words
related to the concept ?riverside?). Two para-
phrases were collected for each dialogue act in
our domain, resulting in a total of 404 aligned ut-

terances produced by 42 native speakers of En-
glish. After manually checking and normalising
the dataset,4 the layered annotations were auto-
matically mapped to phrase-level semantic stacks
by splitting the utterance into phrases at annotation
boundaries. Each annotated utterance is then con-
verted into a sequence of symbols such as in Ta-
ble 2, which are used to estimate the conditional
probability distributions defined in (6) and (8).
The resulting vocabulary consists of 52 distinct se-
mantic stacks and 109 distinct realisation phrases,
with an average of 8.35 phrases per utterance.
5.2 BLEU score evaluation
We first evaluate BAGEL using the BLEU auto-
mated metric (Papineni et al, 2002), which mea-
sures the word n-gram overlap between the gen-
erated utterances and the 2 reference paraphrases
over a test corpus (with n up to 4). While BLEU
suffers from known issues such as a bias towards
statistical NLG systems (Reiter and Belz, 2009), it
provides useful information when comparing sim-
ilar systems. We evaluate BAGEL for different
training set sizes, model dependencies, and active
learning parameters. Our results are averaged over
a 10-fold cross-validation over distinct dialogue
acts, i.e. dialogue acts used for testing are not seen
at training time,5 and all systems are tested on the
same folds. The training and test sets respectively
contain an average of 181 and 21 distinct dialogue
acts, and each dialogue act is associated with two
paraphrases, resulting in 362 training utterances.
4The normalisation process took around 4 person-hour for
404 utterances.
5We do not evaluate performance on dialogue acts used
for training, as the training examples can trivially be used as
generation templates.

Figure 4: BLEU score averaged over a 10-fold
cross-validation for different training set sizes and
network topologies, using random sampling.
Results: Fig. 4 shows that adding a dependency
on the future semantic stack improves perfor-
mances for all training set sizes, despite the added
model complexity. Backing off to partial stacks
also improves performance, but only for sparse
training sets.
Fig. 5 compares the full model trained using
random sampling in Fig. 4 with the same model
trained using certainty-based active learning, for
different values of k. As our dataset only con-
tains two paraphrases per dialogue act, the same
dialogue act can only be queried twice during the
active learning procedure. A consequence is that
the training set used for active learning converges
towards the randomly sampled set as its size in-
creases. Results show that increasing the train-
ing set one utterance at a time using active learn-
ing (k = 1) significantly outperforms random
sampling when using 40, 80, and 100 utterances
(p < .05, two-tailed). Increasing the number of
utterances to be queried at each iteration to k = 10
results in a smaller performance increase. A possi-

Figure 6: BLEU score averaged over a 10-fold
cross-validation for different query selection cri-
teria, using the full model with k = 1.
ble explanation is that the model is likely to assign
low probabilities to similar inputs, thus any value
above k = 1 might result in redundant queries
within an iteration.
As the length of the semantic stack sequence
is not known before decoding, the active learn-
ing selection criterion presented in (9) is biased
towards longer utterances, which tend to have a
lower probability. However, Fig. 6 shows that
normalising the log probability by the number of
semantic stacks does not improve overall learn-
ing performance. Although a possible explanation
is that longer inputs tend to contain more infor-
mation to learn from, Fig. 6 shows that a base-
line selecting the largest remaining semantic input
at each iteration performs worse than the active
learning scheme for training sets above 20 utter-
ances. The full log probability selection criterion
defined in (9) is therefore used throughout the rest
of the paper (with k = 1).
5.3 Human evaluation
While automated metrics provide useful informa-
tion for comparing different systems, human feed-
back is needed to assess (a) the quality of BAGEL?s
outputs, and (b) whether training models using ac-
tive learning has a significant impact on user per-
ceptions. We evaluate BAGEL through a large-
scale subjective rating experiment using Amazon?s
Mechanical Turk service.
For each dialogue act in our domain, partici-
pants are presented with a ?gold standard? human
utterance from our dataset, which they must com-
pare with utterances generated by models trained
with and without active learning on a set of 20, 40,
100, and 362 utterances (full training set), as well
as with the second human utterance in our dataset.
See example utterances in Table 3. The judges are
then asked to evaluate the informativeness and nat-
uralness of each of the 8 utterances on a 5 point
likert-scale. Naturalness is defined as whether the
utterance could have been produced by a human,
and informativeness is defined as whether it con-
tains all the information in the gold standard utter-
ance. Each utterance is taken from the test folds of
the cross-validation experiment presented in Sec-
tion 5.2, i.e. the models are trained on up to 90%
of the data and the training set does not contain the
dialogue act being tested.
Results: Figs. 7 and 8 compare the naturalness
and informativeness scores of each system aver-
aged over all 202 dialogue acts. A paired t-test
shows that models trained on 40 utterances or
less produce utterances that are rated significantly
lower than human utterances for both naturalness
and informativeness (p < .05, two-tailed). How-
ever, models trained on 100 utterances or more do
not perform significantly worse than human utter-
ances for both dimensions, with a mean difference
below .10 over 202 comparisons. Given the large
sample size, this result suggests that BAGEL can
successfully learn our domain using a fraction of
our initial dataset.
As far as the learning method is concerned, a
paired t-test shows that models trained on 20 and
40 utterances using active learning significantly
outperform models trained using random sam-
pling, for both dimensions (p < .05). The largest
increase is observed using 20 utterances, i.e. the
naturalness increases by .49 and the informative-
ness by .37. When training on 100 utterances, the
effect of active learning becomes insignificant. In-

Figure 7: Naturalness mean opinion scores for dif-
ferent training set sizes, using random sampling
and active learning. Differences for training set
sizes of 20 and 40 are all significant (p < .05).
terestingly, while models trained on 100 utterances
outperform models trained on 40 utterances using
random sampling (p < .05), they do not signifi-
cantly outperform models trained on 40 utterances
using active learning (p = .15 for naturalness and
p = .41 for informativeness). These results sug-
gest that certainty-based active learning is benefi-
cial for training a generator from a limited amount
of data given the domain size.
Looking back at the results presented in Sec-
tion 5.2, we find that the BLEU score correlates
with a Pearson correlation coefficient of .42 with
the mean naturalness score and .35 with the mean
informativeness score, over all folds of all systems
tested (n = 70, p < .01). This is lower than
previous correlations reported by Reiter and Belz
(2009) in the shipping forecast domain with non-
expert judges (r = .80), possibly because our do-
main is larger and more open to subjectivity.

6 Related work
While most previous work on trainable NLG re-
lies on a handcrafted component (see Section 1),
recent research has started exploring fully data-
driven NLG models.
Factored language models have recently been
used for surface realisation within the OpenCCG
framework (White et al, 2007; Espinosa et al,
2008). More generally, chart generators for
different grammatical formalisms have been
trained from syntactic treebanks (White et al,
2007; Nakanishi et al, 2005), as well as from
semantically-annotated treebanks (Varges and
Mellish, 2001). However, a major difference with
our approach is that BAGEL uses domain-specific
data to generate a surface form directly from se-
mantic concepts, without any syntactic annotation
(see Section 7 for further discussion).
1559
This work is strongly related to Wong and
Mooney?s WASP?1 generation system (2007),
which combines a language model with an in-
verted synchronous CFG parsing model, effec-
tively casting the generation task as a translation
problem from a meaning representation to natu-
ral language. WASP?1 relies on GIZA++ to align
utterances with derivations of the meaning repre-
sentation (Och and Ney, 2003). Although early
experiments showed that GIZA++ did not perform
well on our data?possibly because of the coarse
granularity of our semantic representation?future
work should evaluate the generalisation perfor-
mance of synchronous CFGs in a dialogue system
domain.
Although we do not know of any work on ac-
tive learning for NLG, previous work has used
active learning for semantic parsing and informa-
tion extraction (Thompson et al, 1999; Tang et al,
2002), spoken language understanding (Tur et al,
2003), speech recognition (Hakkani-Tu?r et al,
2002), word alignment (Sassano, 2002), and more
recently for statistical machine translation (Blood-
good and Callison-Burch, 2010). While certainty-
based methods have been widely used, future work
should investigate the performance of committee-
based active learning for NLG, in which examples
are selected based on the level of disagreement be-
tween models trained on subsets of the data (Fre-
und et al, 1997).
7 Discussion and conclusion
This paper presents and evaluates BAGEL, a sta-
tistical language generator that can be trained en-
tirely from data, with no handcrafting required be-
yond the semantic annotation. All the required
subtasks?i.e. content ordering, aggregation, lex-
ical selection and realisation?are learned from
data using a unified model. To train BAGEL in a di-
alogue system domain, we propose a stack-based
semantic representation at the phrase level, which
is expressive enough to generate natural utterances
from unseen inputs, yet simple enough for data to
be collected from 42 untrained annotators with a
minimal normalisation step. A human evaluation
over 202 dialogue acts does not show any differ-
ence in naturalness and informativeness between
BAGEL?s outputs and human utterances. Addition-
ally, we find that the data collection process can
be optimised using active learning, resulting in a
significant increase in performance when training
data is limited, according to ratings from 18 hu-
man judges.6 These results suggest that the pro-
posed framework can largely reduce the develop-
ment time of NLG systems.
While this paper only evaluates the most likely
realisation given a dialogue act, we believe that
BAGEL?s probabilistic nature and generalisation
capabilities are well suited to model the linguis-
tic variation resulting from the diversity of annota-
tors. Our first objective is thus to evaluate the qual-
ity of BAGEL?s n-best outputs, and test whether
sampling from the output distribution can improve
naturalness and user satisfaction within a dialogue.
Our results suggest that explicitly modelling
syntax is not necessary for our domain, possi-
bly because of the lack of syntactic complexity
compared with formal written language. Never-
theless, future work should investigate whether
syntactic information can improve performance in
more complex domains. For example, the reali-
sation phrase can easily be conditioned on syntac-
tic constructs governing that phrase, and the recur-
sive nature of syntax can be modelled by keeping
track of the depth of the current embedded clause.
While syntactic information can be included with
no human effort by using syntactic parsers, their
robustness to dialogue system utterances must first
be evaluated.
Finally, recent years have seen HMM-based
synthesis models become competitive with unit se-
lection methods (Tokuda et al, 2000). Our long
term objective is to take advantage of those ad-
vances to jointly optimise the language genera-
tion and the speech synthesis process, by combin-
ing both components into a unified probabilistic
concept-to-speech generation model.

Abstract
This paper presents an agenda-based user
simulator which has been extended to be
trainable on real data with the aim of more
closely modelling the complex rational be-
haviour exhibited by real users. The train-
able part is formed by a set of random de-
cision points that may be encountered dur-
ing the process of receiving a system act
and responding with a user act. A sample-
based method is presented for using real
user data to estimate the parameters that
control these decisions. Evaluation results
are given both in terms of statistics of gen-
erated user behaviour and the quality of
policies trained with different simulators.
Compared to a handcrafted simulator, the
trained system provides a much better fit
to corpus data and evaluations suggest that
this better fit should result in improved di-
alogue performance.
1 Introduction
In spoken dialogue systems research, modelling
dialogue as a (Partially Observable) Markov Deci-
sion Process ((PO)MDP) and using reinforcement
learning techniques for optimising dialogue poli-
cies has proven to be an effective method for de-
veloping robust systems (Singh et al, 2000; Levin
et al, 2000). However, since this kind of optimi-
sation requires a simulated user to generate a suffi-
ciently large number of interactions to learn from,
this effectiveness depends largely on the quality
of such a user simulator. An important require-
ment for a simulator is for it to be realistic, i.e., it
should generate behaviour that is similar to that of
real users. Trained policies are then more likely to
perform better on real users, and evaluation results
on simulated data are more likely to predict results
on real data more accurately.
?This research was partly funded by the UK EPSRC un-
der grant agreement EP/F013930/1 and by the EU FP7 Pro-
gramme under grant agreement 216594 (CLASSiC project:
www.classic-project.org).
This is one of the reasons why learning user
simulation models from data on real user be-
haviour has become an important direction of re-
search (Scheffler and Young, 2001; Cuaya?huitl et
al., 2005; Georgila et al, 2006). However, the data
driven user models developed so far lack the com-
plexity required for training high quality policies
in task domains where user behaviour is relatively
complex. Handcrafted models are still the most
effective in those cases.
This paper presents an agenda-based user simu-
lator which is handcrafted for a large part, but ad-
ditionally can be trained with data from real users
(Section 2). As a result, it generates behaviour that
better reflects the statistics of real user behaviour,
whilst preserving the complexity and rationality
required to effectively train dialogue management
policies. The trainable part is formed by a set of
random decision points, which, depending on the
context, may or may not be encountered during
the process of receiving a system act and decid-
ing on a response act. If such a point is encoun-
tered, the simulator makes a random decision be-
tween a number of options which may directly or
indirectly influence the resulting output. The op-
tions for each random decision point are reason-
able in the context in which it is encountered, but
a uniform distribution of outcomes might not re-
flect real user behaviour.
We will describe a sample-based method for es-
timating the parameters that define the probabili-
ties for each possible decision, using data on real
users from a corpus of human-machine dialogues
(Section 3). Evaluation results will be presented
both in terms of statistics on generated user be-
haviour and the quality of dialogue policies trained
with different user simulations (Section 4).
2 Agenda-based user simulation
In agenda-based user simulation, user acts are gen-
erated on the basis of a user goal and an agenda
(Schatzmann et al, 2007a). The simulator pre-
sented here is developed and used for a tourist in-
116
formation application, but is sufficiently generic to
accommodate slot-filling applications in any do-
main.1 The user goal consists of the type of venue,
for example hotel, bar or restaurant, a list
of constraints in the form of slot value pairs, such
as food=Italian or area=east, and a list
of slots the user wants to know the value of, such
as the address (addr), phone number (phone),
or price information (price) of the venue. The
user goals for the simulator are randomly gener-
ated from the domain ontology describing which
combinations of venue types and constraints are
allowed and what are the possible values for each
slot. The agenda is a stack-like structure contain-
ing planned user acts. When the simulator receives
a system act, the status of the user goal is updated
as well as the agenda, typically by pushing new
acts onto it. In a separate step, the response user
act is selected by popping one or more items off
the agenda.
Although the agenda-based user simulator in-
troduced by Schatzmann et al (2007a) was en-
tirely handcrafted, it was realistic enough to suc-
cessfully test a prototype POMDP dialogue man-
ager and train a dialogue policy that outperformed
a handcrafted baseline (Young et al, 2009). A
method to train an agenda-based user simula-
tor from data was proposed by Schatzmann et
al. (2007b). In this approach, operations on
the agenda are controlled by probabilities learned
from data using a variation of the EM algorithm.
However, this approach does not readily scale to
more complex interactions in which users can, for
example, change their goal midway through a dia-
logue.
2.1 Random decision parameters
Each time the user simulator receives a system act,
a complex, two-fold process takes place involving
several decisions, made on the basis of both the
nature of the incoming system act and the infor-
mation state of the user, i.e., the status of the user
goal and agenda. The first phase can be seen as
an information state update and involves actions
like filling requested slots or checking whether the
provided information is consistent with the user
goal constraints. In the second phase, the user de-
cides which response act to generate, based on the
updated agenda. Many of the decisions involved
are deterministic, allowing only one possible op-
tion given the context. Other decisions allow for
some degree of variation in the user behaviour and
are governed by probability distributions over the
1We have to date also implemented systems in appoint-
ment scheduling and bus timetable inquiries.
options allowed in that context. For example, if
the system has offered a venue that matches the
user?s goal, the user can randomly decide to either
change his goal or to accept the venue and ask for
additional information such as the phone number.
The non-deterministic part of the simulator is
formalised in terms of a set of random decision
points (RDPs) embedded in the decision process.
If an RDP is encountered (depending on the con-
text), a random choice between the options de-
fined for that point is made by sampling from a
probability distribution. Most of the RDPs are
controlled by a multinomial distribution, such as
deciding whether or not to change the goal after
a system offer. Some RDPs are controlled by a
geometric distribution, like in the case where the
user is planning to specify one of his constraints
(with an inform act popped from the agenda) and
then repeatedly adds an additional constraint to the
act (by combining it with an additional inform act
popped from the agenda) until it randomly decides
not to add any more constraints (or runs out of
constraints to specify). The parameter for this dis-
tribution thus controls how cautious the user is in
providing information to the system.
Hence, the user simulator can be viewed as
a ?decision network?, consisting of deterministic
and random decision points. This is illustrated in
Figure 1 for the simplified case of a network with
only four RDPs; the actual simulator has 23 RDPs,
with 27 associated parameters in total. Each time
the simulator receives a system act, it follows a
path through the network, which is partly deter-
mined by that system act and the user goal and
agenda, and partly by random decisions made ac-
cording to the probability distributions for each
random decision point i given by its parameters
?i.
3 Training the simulator from data
The parameterisation of the user simulator as de-
scribed in Section 2.1 forms the basis for a method
for training the simulator with real user data. The
parameters describing the probability distributions
for each RDP are estimated in order to generate
user behaviour that fits the user behaviour in the
corpus as closely as possible. In order to do so,
a sample based maximum likelihood approach is
taken, in which the simulator is run repeatedly
against the system acts in the corpus, and the ran-
dom decisions that lead to simulated acts matching
the true act in the corpus are recorded. The param-
eters are then estimated using the counts for each
of the random decision points.

points; round nodes indicate random decision points, and have associated parameters ?i; the loop on one

3.1 Parameter estimation
Before starting the process of matching simulated
acts with true acts and collecting counts for the
RDPs, the parameters are initialised to values cor-
responding to uniform distributions. Then, the
simulator is run against all dialogues in the cor-
pus in such a way that for each turn in a dialogue
(consisting of a system act and a user act), the user
simulator is provided with the system act and is
run repeatedly to generate several simulated user
response acts for that turn. For the first turn of a di-
alogue, the simulator is initialised with the correct
user state (see Section 3.2). For each response, the
simulator may make different random decisions,
generally leading to different user acts. The deci-
sions that lead to a simulated act that matches the
true act are recorded as successful. By generating
a sufficiently large number of simulated acts, all
possible combinations of decisions are explored to
find a matching act. Given the high complexity of
the simulator, this sampling approach is preferred
over directly enumerating all decision combina-
tions to identify the successful ones. If none of
the combinations are successful, then either a) the
processing of the dialogue is ended, or b) the cor-
rect context is set for the next turn and processing
is continued. Whereas the former approach aims at
matching sequences of turns, the latter only aims
at matching each user turn separately. In either
case, after all data is processed, the parameters are
estimated using the resulting counts of successful
decisions for each of the RDPs.
For each RDP i, let DPi represent the decision
taken, and dij the j?th possible decision. Then, for
each decision point i that is controlled by a multi-
nomial distribution, the corresponding parameter
estimates ?ij are obtained as follows from the de-
cision frequencies c(DPi = dij):
?ij =
c(DPi = dij)
?
j c(DPi = dij)
(1)
Random decision points that are controlled
by geometric distributions involve potentially
multiple random decisions between two options
(Bernoulli trials). The parameters for such RDPs
are estimated as follows:
?i =
(
1
n
n
?
k=1
bik
)?1
(2)
where bik is the number of Bernoulli trials re-
quired at the k?th time decision point i was en-
countered. In terms of the decision network, this
estimate is correlated with the average number of
times the loop of the node was taken.
3.2 User goal inference
In order to be able to set the correct user goal
state in any given turn, a set of update rules is
used to infer the user?s goals from a dialogue be-
forehand, on the basis of the entire sequence of
system acts and ?true? user acts (see Section 4.1)
in the corpus. These update rules are based on
the notion of dialogue act preconditions, which
specify conditions of the dialogue context that
must hold for a dialogue agent to perform that
act. For example, a precondition for the act
inform(area=central) is that the speaker
wants a venue in the centre. The user act model
118
of the HIS dialogue manager is designed accord-
ing to this same notion (Keizer et al, 2008). In this
model, the probability of a user act in a certain dia-
logue context (the last system act and a hypothesis
regarding the user goal) is determined by checking
the consistency of its preconditions with that con-
text. This contributes to updating the system?s be-
lief state on the basis of which it determines its re-
sponse action. For the user goal inference model,
the user act is given and therefore its precondi-
tions can be used to directly infer the user goal.
So, for example, in the case of observing the user
act inform(area=central), the constraint
(area=central) is added to the user goal.
In addition to using the inferred user goals, the
agenda is corrected in cases where there is a mis-
match between real and simulated user acts in the
previous turn.
In using this offline goal inference model, our
approach takes a position between (Schatzmann et
al., 2007b), in which the user?s goal is treated as
hidden, and (Georgila et al, 2006), in which the
user?s goal is obtained directly from the corpus an-
notation.
4 Evaluation
The parameter estimation technique for training
the user simulator was evaluated in two differ-
ent ways. The first evaluation involved compar-
ing the statistics of simulated and real user be-
haviour. The second evaluation involved compar-
ing dialogue manager policies trained with differ-
ent simulators.
4.1 Data
The task of the dialogue systems we are develop-
ing is to provide tourist information to users, in-
volving venues such as bars, restaurants and hotels
that the user can search for and ask about. These
venues are described in terms of features such as
price range, area, type of food, phone number,
address, and so on. The kind of dialogues with
these systems are commonly called slot-filling di-
alogues.
Within the range of slot-filling applications the
domain is relatively complex due to its hierarchi-
cal data structure and relatively large number of
slots and their possible values. Scalability is in-
deed one of the primary challenges to be addressed
in statistical approaches to dialogue system devel-
opment, including user simulation.
The dialogue corpus that was used for training
and evaluating the simulator was obtained from
the evaluation of a POMDP spoken dialogue sys-
tem with real users. All user utterances in the
resulting corpus were transcribed and semanti-
cally annotated in terms of dialogue acts. Dia-
logue acts consist of a series of semantic items,
including the type (describing the intention of
the speaker, e.g., inform or request) and a
list of slot value pairs (e.g., food=Chinese or
area=south). An extensive analysis of the an-
notations from three different people revealed a
high level of inter-annotator agreement (ranging
from 0.81 to 0.94, depending on which pair of an-
notations are compared), and a voting scheme for
selecting a single annotation for each turn ensured
the reliability of the ?true? user acts used for train-
ing the simulator.
4.2 Corpus statistics results
A first approach to evaluating user simulations is
to look at the statistics of the user behaviour that
is generated by a simulator and compare it with
that of real users as observed in a dialogue cor-
pus. Several metrics for such evaluations have
been considered in the literature, all of which have
both strong points and weaknesses. For the present
evaluation, a selection of metrics believed to give
a reasonable first indication of the quality of the
user simulations was considered2 .
4.2.1 Metrics
The first corpus-based evaluation metric is the Log
Likelihood (LL) of the data, given the user simu-
lation model. This is what is in fact maximised by
the parameter estimation algorithm. The log like-
lihood can be computed by summing the log prob-
abilities of each user turn du in the corpus data D:
ll(D|{?ij}, {?i}) =
?
u
log P (du|{?ij}, {?i})
(3)
The user turn probability is given by the prob-
ability of the decision paths (directed paths in the
decision network of maximal length, such as the
one indicated in Figure 1 in bold) leading to a sim-
ulated user act in that turn that matches the true
user act. The probability of a decision path is ob-
tained by multiplying the probabilities of the de-
cisions made at each decision point i that was en-
countered, which are given by the parameters ?ij
2Note that not all selected metrics are metrics in the strict
sense of the word; the term should therefore be interpreted as
a more general one.
119
and ?i:
logP (du|{?ij}, {?i}) =
?
i?Im(u)
log
(
?
j
?ij ? ?ij(u)
)
+ (4)
?
i?Ig(u)
log
(
?
k
(1 ? ?i)k?1 ? ?i ? ?ik(u)
)
where Im(u) = {i ? Im|?j ?ij(u) > 0} and
Ig(u) = {i ? Ig|
?
k ?ik(u) > 0} are the subsets
of the multinomial (Im) and geometric (Ig) de-
cision points respectively containing those points
that were encountered in any combination of deci-
sions resulting in the given user act:
?ij(u) =
?
?
?
?
?
1 if decision DPi = dij was
taken in any of the
matching combinations
0 otherwise
(5)
?ik(u) =
?
?
?
?
?
1 if any of the matching
combinations required
k > 0 trials
0 otherwise
(6)
It should be noted that the log likelihood only
represents those turns in the corpus for which the
simulated user can produce a matching simulated
act with some probability. Hence, it is impor-
tant to also take into account the corpus cover-
age when considering the log likelihood in cor-
pus based evaluation. Dividing by the number of
matched turns provides a useful normalisation in
this respect.
The expected Precision (PRE), Recall (RCL),
and F-Score (FS) are obtained by comparing the
simulated user acts with the true user acts in the
same context (Georgila et al, 2006). These scores
are obtained by pairwise comparison of the simu-
lated and true user act for each turn in the corpus
at the level of the semantic items:
PRE = #(matched items)#(items in simulated act) (7)
RCL = #(matched items)#(items in true act) (8)
FS = 2 ? PRE ? RCLPRE + RCL (9)
By sampling a sufficient number of simulated
acts for each turn in the corpus and comparing
them with the corresponding true acts, this results
in an accurate measure on average.
The problem with precision and recall is that
they are known to heavily penalise unseen data.
Any attempt to generalise and therefore increase
the variability of user behaviour results in lower
scores.
Another way of evaluating the user simulator
is to look at the global user act distributions it
generates and compare them to the distributions
found in the real user data. A common metric
for comparing such distributions is the Kullback-
Leibler (KL) distance. In (Cuaya?huitl et al,
2005) this metric was used to evaluate an HMM-
based user simulation approach. The KL dis-
tance is computed by taking the average of the
two KL divergences3 DKL(simulated||true) and
DKL(true||simulated), where:
DKL(p||q) =
?
i
pi ? log2(
pi
qi
) (10)
KL distances are computed for both full user act
distributions (taking into account both the dia-
logue act type and slot value pairs) and user act
type distributions (only regarding the dialogue act
type), denoted by KLF and KLT respectively.
4.2.2 Results
For the experiments, the corpus data was ran-
domly split into a training set, consisting of 4479
user turns in 541 dialogues, used for estimat-
ing the user simulator parameters, and a test set,
consisting of 1457 user turns in 175 dialogues,
used for evaluation only. In the evaluation, the
following parameter settings were compared: 1)
non-informative, uniform parameters (UNIF); 2)
handcrafted parameters (HDC); 3) parameters es-
timated from data (TRA); and 4) deterministic pa-
rameters (DET), in which for each RDP the prob-
ability of the most probable decision according to
the estimated parameters is set to 1, i.e., at all
times, the most likely decision according to the es-
timated parameters is chosen.
For both trained and deterministic parameters,
a distinction is made between the two approaches
to matching user acts during parameter estimation.
Recall that in the turn-based approach, in each
turn, the simulator is run with the corrected con-
text to find a matching simulated act, whereas in
the sequence-based approach, the matching pro-
cess for a dialogue is stopped in case a turn
is encountered which cannot be matched by the
simulator. This results in estimated parameters
TRA-T and deterministic parameters DET-T for

applied in order to avoid zero-probabilities.

the turn-based approach and analogously TRA-S
and DET-S for the sequence-based approach. The
corresponding normalised (see Section 4.2.1) log-
likelihoods are indicated by nLL-T and nLL-S.
Tables 1 and 2 give the results on the training
and test data respectively. The results show that in
terms of log-likelihood and KL-distances, the es-
timated parameters outperform the other settings,
regardless of the matching method. In terms of
precision/recall (given in percentages with 95%
confidence intervals), the estimated parameters
are worse than the handcrafted parameters for
turn-based matching, but have similar scores for
sequence-based matching.
The results for the deterministic parameters il-
lustrate that much better precision/recall scores
can be obtained, but at the expense of variability as
well as the KL-distances. It will be easier to train
a dialogue policy on such a deterministic simula-
tor, but that policy is likely to perform significantly
worse on the more varied behaviour generated by
the trained simulator, as we will see in Section 4.3.
Out of the two matching approaches, the
sequence-based approach gives the best results:
TRA-S outperforms TRA-T on all scores, except
for the coverage which is much lower for the
sequence-based approach (33% vs. 59%).
4.3 Policy evaluation results
Although the corpus-based evaluation results give
a useful indication of how realistic the behaviour
generated by a simulator is, what really should be
evaluated is the dialogue management policy that
is trained using that simulator. Therefore, differ-
ent parameter sets for the simulator were used to
train and evaluate different policies for the Hidden
Information State (HIS) dialogue manager (Young
et al, 2009). Four different policies were trained:
one policy using handcrafted simulation param-
eters (POL-HDC); two policies using simulation
parameters estimated (using the sequence-based
matching approach) from two data sets that were
obtained by randomly splitting the data into two
parts of 358 dialogues each (POL-TRA1 and POL-
TRA2); and finally, a policy using a determin-
istic simulator (POL-DET) constructed from the
trained parameters as discussed in Section 4.2.2.
The policies were then each evaluated on the sim-
ulator using the four parameter settings at different
semantic error rates.
The performance of a policy is measured in
terms of a reward that is given for each dialogue,
i.e. a reward of 20 for a successful dialogue, mi-
nus the number of turns. A dialogue is consid-
ered successful if the system has offered a venue
matching the predefined user goal constraints and
has given the correct values of all requested slots
for this venue. During the policy optimisation, in
which a reinforcement learning algorithm tries to
optimise the expected long term reward, this dia-
logue scoring regime was also used.
In Figures 2, 3, and 4, evaluation results are
given resulting from running 3000 dialogues at
each of 11 different semantic error rates. The
curves show average rewards with 95% confidence
intervals. The error rate is controlled by a hand-

crafted error model that converts the user act gen-
erated by the simulator into an n-best list of dia-
logue act hypotheses.
The policy that was trained using the hand-
crafted simulator (POL-HDC) outperforms the
other policies when evaluated on that same sim-
ulator (see Figure 2), and both policies trained us-
ing the trained simulators (POL-TRA1 and POL-
TRA2) outperform the other policies when evalu-
ated on either trained simulator (see Figure 3 for
the evaluation on UM-TRA1; the evaluation on
UM-TRA2 is very similar and therefore omitted).
There is little difference in performance between
policies POL-TRA1 and POL-TRA2, which can
be explained by the fact that the two trained
parameter settings are quite similar, in contrast
to the handcrafted parameters. The policy that
was trained on the deterministic parameters (POL-
DET) is competitive with the other policies when
evaluated on UM-DET (see Figure 4), but per-
forms significantly worse on the other parameter
settings which generate the variation in behaviour
that the dialogue manager did not encounter dur-
ing training of POL-DET.
In addition to comparing the policies when eval-
uated on each simulator separately, another com-
parison was made in terms of the average perfor-
mance across all simulators. For each policy and
each simulator, we first computed the difference
between the policy?s performance and the ?maxi-
mum? performance on that simulator as achieved
by the policy that was also trained on that simu-
lator, and then averaged over all simulators. To
avoid biased results, only one of the trained simu-
lators was included. The results in Figure 5 show
that the POL-TRA2 policy is more robust than
POL-DET, and has similar robustness as POL-
HDC. Similar results are obtained when including
UM-TRA1 only.
Given that the results of Section 4.2 show that
the dialogues generated by the trained simulator
more closely match real corpus data, and given
that the above simulation results show that the
POL-TRA policies are at least as robust as the
122
other policies, it seems likely that policies trained
using the trained user simulator will show im-
proved performance when evaluated on real users.
However, this claim can only be properly
demonstrated in a real user evaluation of the di-
alogue system containing different dialogue man-
agement policies. Such a user trial would also be
able to confirm whether the results from evalua-
tions on the trained simulator can more accurately
predict the actual performance expected with real
users.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented an agenda-based user
simulator extended to be trainable on real user
data whilst preserving the necessary rationality
and complexity for effective training and evalu-
ation of dialogue manager policies. The exten-
sion involved the incorporation of random deci-
sion points in the process of receiving and re-
sponding to a system act in each turn. The deci-
sions made at these points are controlled by prob-
ability distributions defined by a set of parameters.
A sample-based maximum likelihood approach
to estimating these parameters from real user data
in a corpus of human-machine dialogues was dis-
cussed, and two kinds of evaluations were pre-
sented. When comparing the statistics of real ver-
sus simulated user behaviour in terms of a selec-
tion of different metrics, overall, the estimated pa-
rameters were shown to give better results than
the handcrafted baselines. When evaluating dia-
logue management policies trained on the simula-
tor with different parameter settings, it was shown
that: 1) policies trained on a particular parame-
ter setting outperform other policies when evalu-
ated on the same parameters, and in particular, 2)
a policy trained on the trained simulator outper-
forms other policies on a trained simulator. With
the general goal of obtaining a dialogue manager
that performs better in practice, these results are
encouraging, but need to be confirmed by an eval-
uation of the policies on real users.
Additionally, there is still room for improving
the quality of the simulator itself. For example,
the variation in user behaviour can be improved by
adding more random decision points, in order to
achieve better corpus coverage. In addition, since
there is no clear consensus on what is the best met-
ric for evaluating user simulations, additional met-
rics will be explored in order to get a more bal-
anced indication of the quality of the user simu-
lator and how the various metrics are affected by
modifications to the simulator. Perplexity (related
to the log likelihood, see (Georgila et al, 2005)),
accuracy (related to precision/recall, see (Zuker-
man and Albrecht, 2001; Georgila et al, 2006)),
and Crame?r-von Mises divergence (comparing di-
alogue score distributions, see (Williams, 2008))
are some of the metrics worth considering.

Abstract
Modelling dialogue as a Partially Observ-
able Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
enables a dialogue policy robust to speech
understanding errors to be learnt. How-
ever, a major challenge in POMDP pol-
icy learning is to maintain tractability, so
the use of approximation is inevitable.
We propose applying Gaussian Processes
in Reinforcement learning of optimal
POMDP dialogue policies, in order (1) to
make the learning process faster and (2) to
obtain an estimate of the uncertainty of the
approximation. We first demonstrate the
idea on a simple voice mail dialogue task
and then apply this method to a real-world
tourist information dialogue task.
1 Introduction
One of the main challenges in dialogue manage-
ment is effective handling of speech understand-
ing errors. Instead of hand-crafting the error han-
dler for each dialogue step, statistical approaches
allow the optimal dialogue manager behaviour
to be learnt automatically. Reinforcement learn-
ing (RL), in particular, enables the notion of plan-
ning to be embedded in the dialogue management
criteria. The objective of the dialogue manager is
for each dialogue state to choose such an action
that leads to the highest expected long-term re-
ward, which is defined in this framework by the Q-
function. This is in contrast to Supervised learn-
ing, which estimates a dialogue strategy in such a
way as to make it resemble the behaviour from a
given corpus, but without directly optimising over-
all dialogue success.
Modelling dialogue as a Partially Observable
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) allows action
selection to be based on the differing levels of un-
certainty in each dialogue state as well as the over-
all reward. This approach requires that a distribu-
tion of states (belief state) is maintained at each
turn. This explicit representation of uncertainty in
the POMDP gives it the potential to produce more
robust dialogue policies (Young et al, 2010).
The main challenge in the POMDP approach is
the tractability of the learning process. A dis-
crete state space POMDP can be perceived as a
continuous space MDP where the state space con-
sists of the belief states of the original POMDP.
A grid-based approach to policy optimisation as-
sumes discretisation of this space, allowing for
discrete space MDP algorithms to be used for
learning (Brafman, 1997) and thus approximating
the optimal Q-function. Such an approach takes
the order of 100, 000 dialogues to train a real-
world dialogue manager. Therefore, the training
normally takes place in interaction with a simu-
lated user, rather than real users. This raises ques-
tions regarding the quality of the approximation
as well as the potential discrepancy between sim-
ulated and real user behaviour.
Gaussian Processes have been successfully used
in Reinforcement learning for continuous space
MDPs, for both model-free approaches (Engel et
al., 2005) and model-based approaches (Deisen-
roth et al, 2009). We propose using GP Rein-
forcement learning in a POMDP dialogue man-
ager to, firstly, speed up the learning process and,
secondly, obtain the uncertainty of the approxima-
tion. We opt for the model-free approach since it
has the potential to allow the policy obtained in
interaction with the simulated user to be further
refined in interaction with real users.
In the next section, the core idea of the method is
explained on a toy dialogue problem where differ-
ent aspects of GP learning are examined. Follow-
ing that, in Section 3, it is demonstrated how this
methodology can be effectively applied to a real
world dialogue. We conclude with Section 4.
2 Gaussian Process RL on a Toy Problem
2.1 Gaussian Process RL
A Gaussian Process is a generative model of
Bayesian inference that can be used for function
regression (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005). A
Gaussian Process is fully defined by a mean and a
kernel function. The kernel function defines prior
function correlations, which is crucial for obtain-
ing good posterior estimates with just a few ob-
servations. GP-Sarsa is an on-line reinforcement
learning algorithm for both continuous and dis-
crete MDPs that incorporates GP regression (En-
201
gel et al, 2005). Given the observation of rewards,
it estimates the Q-function utilising its correlations
in different parts of the state and the action space
defined by the kernel function. It also gives a vari-
ance of the estimate, thus modelling the uncer-
tainty of the approximation.
2.2 Voice Mail Dialogue Task
In order to demonstrate how this methodology
can be applied to a dialogue system, we first ex-
plain the idea on the voice mail dialogue prob-
lem (Williams, 2006).
The state space of this task consists of three states:
the user asked for the message either to be saved
or deleted, or the dialogue ended. The system
can take three actions: ask the user what to do,
save or delete the message. The observation of
what the user wants is corrupted with noise, there-
fore we model this as a three-state POMDP. This
POMDP can be viewed as a continuous MDP,
where the MDP state is the POMDP belief state,
a 3-dimensional vector of probabilities. For both
learning and evaluation, a simulated user is used
which makes an error with probability 0.3 and ter-
minates the dialogue after at most 10 turns. In the
final state, it gives a positive reward of 10 or a
penalty of ?100 depending on whether the system
performed a correct action or not. Each interme-
diate state receives the penalty of ?1. In order to
keep the problem simple, a model defining tran-
sition and observation probabilities is assumed so
that the belief can be easily updated, but the policy
optimisation is performed in an on-line fashion.
2.3 Kernel Choice for GP-Sarsa
The choice of kernel function is very important
since it defines the prior knowledge about the Q-
function correlations. They have to be defined on
both states and actions. In the voice mail dialogue
problem the action space is discrete, so we opt for
a simple ? kernel over actions:
k(a, a?) = 1 ? ?a(a?), (1)
where ?a is the Kronecker delta function. The
state space is a 3-dimensional continuous space
and the kernel functions over the state space that
we explore are given in Table 1. Each kernel func-
kernel function expression

Table 1: Kernel functions
tion defines a different correlation. The polyno-
mial kernel views elements of the state vector as
features, the dot-product of which defines the cor-
relation. They can be given different relevance ri
in the parametrised version. The Gaussian ker-
nel accounts for smoothness, i.e., if two states are
close to each other the Q-function in these states
is correlated. The scaled norm kernel defines posi-
tive correlations in the points that are close to each
other and a negative correlation otherwise. This
is particularly useful for the voice mail problem,
where, if two belief states are very different, tak-
ing the same action in these states generates a neg-
atively correlated reward.
2.4 Optimisation of Kernel Parameters
Some kernel functions are in a parametrised
form, such as Gaussian or parametrised polyno-
mial kernel. These parameters, also called the
hyper-parameters, are estimated by maximising
the marginal likelihood1 on a given corpus (Ras-
mussen and Williams, 2005). We adapted the
available code (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005)
for the Reinforcement learning framework to ob-
tain the optimal hyper-parameters using a dialogue
corpus labelled with states, actions and rewards.
2.5 Grid-based RL Algorithms
To assess the performance of GP-Sarsa, it was
compared with a standard grid-based algorithm
used in (Young et al, 2010). The grid-based ap-
proach discretises the continuous space into re-
gions with their representative points. This then
allows discrete MDP algorithms to be used for pol-
icy optimisation, in this case the Monte Carlo Con-
trol (MCC) algorithm (Sutton and Barto, 1998).
2.6 Optimal POMDP Policy
The optimal POMDP policy was obtained us-
ing the POMDP solver toolkit (Cassandra, 2005),
which implements the Point Based Value Itera-
tion algorithm to solve the POMDP off-line using
the underlying transition and observation proba-
bilities. We used 300 sample dialogues between
the dialogue manager governed by this policy and
the simulated user as data for optimisation of the
kernel hyper-parameters (see Section 2.4).
2.7 Training set-up and Evaluation
The dialogue manager was trained in interaction
with the simulated user and the performance was
compared between the grid-based MCC algorithm
and GP-Sarsa across different kernel functions
from Table 1.
The intention was, not only to test which algo-
rithm yields the best policy performance, but also
to examine the speed of convergence to the opti-
mal policy. All the algorithms use an ?-greedy
approach where the exploration rate ? was fixed
at 0.1. The learning process greatly depends on
1Also called evidence maximisation in the literature.

the actions that are taken during exploration. If
early on during the training, the systems discovers
a path that generates high rewards due to a lucky
choice of actions, then the convergence is faster.
To alleviate this, we adopted the following proce-
dure. For every training set-up, exactly the same
training iterations were performed using 1000 dif-
ferent random generator seedings. After every 20
dialogues the resulting 1000 partially optimised
policies were evaluated. Each of them was tested
on 1000 dialogues. The average reward of these
1000 dialogues provides just one point in Fig. 1.

Grid?based Monte Carlo Control
Figure 1: Evaluation results on Voice Mail task
The grid-based MCC algorithm used a Euclid-
ian distance to generate the grid by adding every
point that was further than 0.01 from other points
as a representative of a new region. As can be
seen from Fig 1, the grid-Based MCC algorithm
has a relatively slow convergence rate. GP-Sarsa
with the polynomial kernel exhibited a learning
rate similar to MCC in the first 300 training di-
alogues, continuing with a more upward learning
trend. The parametrised polynomial kernel per-
forms slightly better. The Gaussian kernel, how-
ever, achieves a much faster learning rate. The
scaled norm kernel achieved close to optimal per-
formance in 400 dialogues, with a much higher
convergence rate then the other methods.
3 Gaussian Process RL on a Real-world
Task
3.1 HIS Dialogue Manager on CamInfo
Domain
We investigate the use of GP-Sarsa in a real-
world task by extending the Hidden Information
State (HIS) dialogue manager (Young et al, 2010).
The application domain is tourist information for
Cambridge, whereby the user can ask for informa-
tion about a restaurant, hotel, museum or another
tourist attraction in the local area. The database
consists of more than 400 entities each of which
has up to 10 attributes that the user can query.
The HIS dialogue manager is a POMDP-based di-
alogue manager that can tractably maintain belief
states for large domains. The key feature of this
approach is the grouping of possible user goals
into partitions, using relationships between differ-
ent attributes from possible user goals. Partitions
are combined with possible user dialogue actions
from the N-best user input as well as with the di-
alogue history. This combination forms the state
space ? the set of hypotheses, the probability dis-
tribution over which is maintained during the di-
alogue. Since the number of states for any real-
world problem is too large, for tractable policy
learning, both the state and the action space are
mapped into smaller scale summary spaces. Once
an adequate summary action is found in the sum-
mary space, it is mapped back to form an action in
the original master space.
3.2 Kernel Choice for GP-Sarsa
The summary state in the HIS system is a four-
dimensional space consisting of two elements that
are continuous (the probability of the top two hy-
potheses) and two discrete elements (one relating
the portion of the database entries that matches the
top partition and the other relating to the last user
action type). The summary action space is discrete
and consists of eleven elements.
In order to apply the GP-Sarsa algorithm, a kernel
function needs to be specified for both the sum-
mary state space and the summary action space.
The nature of this space is quite different from the
one described in the toy problem. Therefore, ap-
plying a kernel that has negative correlations, such
as the scaled norm kernel (Table 1) might give un-
expected results. More specifically, for a given
summary action, the mapping procedure finds the
most appropriate action to perform if such an ac-
tion exists. This can lead to a lower reward if
the summary action is not adequate but would
rarely lead to negatively correlated rewards. Also,
parametrised kernels could not be used for this
task, since there was no corpus available for hyper-
parameter optimisation. The polynomial kernel
(Table 1) assumes that the elements of the space
are features. Due to the way the probability is
maintained over this very large state space, the
continuous variables potentially encode more in-
formation than in the simple toy problem. There-
fore, we used the polynomial kernel for the con-
tinuous elements. For discrete elements, we utilise
the ?-kernel (Eq. 2.3).
3.3 Active Learning GP-Sarsa
The GP RL framework enables modelling the un-
certainty of the approximation. The uncertainty
estimate can be used to decide which actions
to take during the exploration (Deisenroth et al,
203
2009). In detail, instead of a random action, the
action in which the Q-function for the current state
has the highest variance is taken.
3.4 Training Set-up and Evaluation
Policy optimisation is performed by interacting
with a simulated user on the dialogue act level.
The simulated user gives a reward at the final state
of the dialogue, and that is 20 if the dialogue was
successful, 0 otherwise, less the number of turns
taken to fulfil the user goal. The simulated user
takes a maximum of 100 turns in each dialogue,
terminating it when all the necessary information
has been obtained or if it looses patience.
A grid-based MCC algorithm provides the base-
line method. The distance metric used ensures
that the number of regions in the grid is small
enough for the learning to be tractable (Young et
al., 2010).
In order to measure how fast each algorithm
learns, a similar training set-up to the one pre-
sented in Section 2.7 was adopted and the aver-
aged results are plotted on the graph, Fig. 2.

The results show that in the very early stage of
learning, i.e., during the first 400 dialogues, the
GP-based method learns faster. Also, the learning
process can be accelerated by adopting the active
learning framework where the actions are selected
based on the estimated uncertainty.
After performing many iterations in an incremen-
tal noise learning set-up (Young et al, 2010) both
the GP-Sarsa and the grid-based MCC algorithms
converge to the same performance.
4 Conclusions
This paper has described how Gaussian Processes
in Reinforcement learning can be successfully ap-
plied to dialogue management. We implemented
a GP-Sarsa algorithm on a toy dialogue prob-
lem, showing that with an appropriate kernel func-
tion faster convergence can be achieved. We also
demonstrated how kernel parameters can be learnt
from a dialogue corpus, thus creating a bridge
between Supervised and Reinforcement learning
methods in dialogue management. We applied
GP-Sarsa to a real-world dialogue task showing
that, on average, this method can learn faster than
a grid-based algorithm. We also showed that the
variance that GP is estimating can be used in an
Active learning setting to further accelerate policy
optimisation.
Further research is needed in the area of kernel
function selection. The results here suggest that
the GP framework can facilitate faster learning,
which potentially allows the use of larger sum-
mary spaces. In addition, being able to learn ef-
ficiently from a small number of dialogues offers
the potential for learning from direct interaction
with real users.

Abstract 
The Spoken Dialog Challenge 2010 was an 
exercise to investigate how different spo-
ken dialog systems perform on the same 
task.  The existing Let?s Go Pittsburgh Bus 
Information System was used as a task and 
four teams provided systems that were first 
tested in controlled conditions with speech 
researchers as users. The three most stable 
systems were then deployed to real callers.  
This paper presents the results of the live 
tests, and compares them with the control 
test results. Results show considerable 
variation both between systems and be-
tween the control and live tests.  Interest-
ingly, relatively high task completion for 
controlled tests did not always predict 
relatively high task completion for live 
tests.  Moreover, even though the systems 
were quite different in their designs, we 
saw very similar correlations between word 
error rate and task completion for all the 
systems.  The dialog data collected is 
available to the research community. 
1 Background 
The goal of the Spoken Dialog Challenge (SDC) is 
to investigate how different dialog systems per-
form on a similar task.  It is designed as a regularly 
recurring challenge. The first one took place in 
2010. SDC participants were to provide one or 
more of three things: a system; a simulated user, 
and/or an evaluation metric.   The task chosen for 
the first SDC was one that already had a large 
number of real callers. This had several advan-
tages. First, there was a system that had been used 
by many callers. Second, there was a substantial 
dataset that participants could use to train their sys-
tems.  Finally, there were real callers, rather than 
only lab testers.  Past work has found systems 
which appear to perform well in lab tests do not 
always perform well when deployed to real callers, 
in part because real callers behave differently than 
lab testers, and usage conditions can be considera-
bly different [Raux et al2005, Ai et al2008].  De-
ploying systems to real users is an important trait 
of the Spoken Dialog Challenge. 
The CMU Let?s Go Bus Information system 
[Raux et al2006] provides bus schedule informa-
tion for the general population of Pittsburgh.  It is 
directly connected to the local Port Authority, 
whose evening calls for bus information are redi-
rected to the automated system.  The system has 
been running since March 2005 and has served 
over 130K calls. 
The software and the previous years of dialog 
data were released to participants of the challenge 
to allow them to construct their own systems.  A 
number of sites started the challenge, and four sites 
successfully built systems, including the original 
CMU system. 
An important aspect of the challenge is that 
the quality of service to the end users (people in 
Pittsburgh) had to be maintained and thus an initial 
robustness and quality test was carried out on con-
tributed systems.  This control test provided sce-
narios over a web interface and required 
researchers from the participating sites to call each 
of the systems.  The results of this control test were 
published in [Black et al 2010] and by the individ-
ual participants [Williams et al 2010, Thomson et 
al. 2010, Hastie et al 2010] and they are repro-
2
duced below to give the reader a comparison with 
the later live tests. 
Important distinctions between the control 
test callers and the live test callers were that the 
control test callers were primarily spoken dialog 
researchers from around the world.  Although they 
were usually calling from more controlled acoustic 
conditions, most were not knowledgeable about 
Pittsburgh geography.     
As mentioned above, four systems took part 
in the SDC.  Following the practice of other chal-
lenges, we will not explicitly identify the sites 
where these systems were developed. We simply 
refer to them as SYS1-4 in the results.  We will, 
however, state that one of the systems is the system 
that has been running for this task for several 
years. The architectures of the systems cover a 
number of different techniques for building spoken 
dialog systems, including agenda based systems, 
VoiceXML and statistical techniques. 
2 Conditions of Control and Live tests 
For this task, the caller needs to provide the depar-
ture stop, the arrival stop and the time of departure 
or arrival in order for the system to be able to per-
form a lookup in the schedule database. The route 
number can also be provided and used in the 
lookup, but it is not necessary. The present live 
system covers the East End of Pittsburgh.  Al-
though the Port Authority message states that other 
areas are not covered, callers may still ask for 
routes that are not in the East End; in this case, the 
live system must say it doesn?t have information 
available.  Some events that affect the length of the 
dialog include whether the system uses implicit or 
explicit confirmation or some combination of both, 
whether the system has an open-ended first turn or 
a directed one, and whether it deals with requests 
for the previous and/or following bus (this latter 
should have been present in all of the systems). 
Just before the SDC started, the Port Author-
ity had removed some of its bus routes. The sys-
tems were required to be capable of informing the 
caller that the route had been canceled, and then 
giving them a suitable alternative. 
SDC systems answer live calls when the Port 
Authority call center is closed in the evening and 
early morning.  There are quite different types and 
volumes of calls over the different days of the 
week.  Weekend days typically have more calls, in 
part because the call center is open fewer hours on 
weekends.  Figure 1 shows a histogram of average 
calls per hour for the evening and the early morn-
ing of each day of the week.

(dark bars) and weekdays. Listed are names of days and 
times before and after midnight when callers called the 
system. 
 
The control tests were set up through a simple 
web interface that presented 8 different scenarios 
to callers. Callers were given a phone number to 
call; each caller spoke to each of the 4 different 
systems twice.  A typical scenario was presented 
with few words, mainly relying on graphics in or-
der to avoid influencing the caller?s choice of vo-
cabulary.  An example is shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Typical scenario for the control tests.  This 
example requests that the user find a bus from the cor-
ner of Forbes and Morewood (near CMU) to the airport, 
using bus route 28X, arriving by 10:45 AM.

3 Control Test Results 
The logs from the four systems were labeled for 
task success by hand.  A call is successful if any of 
the following outputs are correctly issued: 
 
? Bus schedule for the requested departure and 
arrival stops for the stated bus number (if giv-
en). 
? A statement that there is no bus available for 
that route. 
? A statement that there is no scheduled bus at 
that time. 
 
We additionally allowed the following boundary 
cases: 
 
? A departure/arrival stop within 15 minutes 
walk. 
? Departure/arrival times within one hour of re-
quested time. 
? An alternate bus number that serves the re-
quested route. 
 
In the control tests, SYS2 had system connection 
issues that caused a number of calls to fail to con-
nect, as well as a poorer task completion.  It was 
not included in the live tests.  It should be pointed 
out that SYS2 was developed by a single graduate 
student as a class project while the other systems 
were developed by teams of researchers.  The re-
sults of the Control Tests are shown in Table 1 and 
are discussed further below. 
 
Table 1. Results of hand analysis of the four systems in 
the control test 
 The three major classes of system response 
are as follows.  no_info: this occurs when the sys-
tem gives neither a specific time nor a valid excuse 
(bus not covered, or none at that time).  no_info 
calls can be treated as errors (even though there 
maybe be valid reasons such as the caller hangs up 
because the bus they are waiting for arrives).  
donthave: identifies calls that state the requested 
bus is not covered by the system or that there is no 
bus at the requested time. pos_out: identifies calls 
where a specific time schedule is given.  Both 
donthave and pos_out calls may be correct or er-
roneous (e.g the given information is not for the 
requested bus,  the departure stop is wrong, etc). 
4 Live Tests Results 
In the live tests the actual Pittsburgh callers had 
access to three systems: SYS1, SYS3, and SYS4.  
Although engineering issues may not always be 
seen to be as relevant as scientific results, it is im-
portant to acknowledge several issues that had to 
be overcome in order to run the live tests. 
Since the Pittsburgh Bus Information System 
is a real system, it is regularly updated with new 
schedules from the Port Authority. This happens 
about every three months and sometimes includes 
changes in bus routes as well as times and stops. 
The SDC participants were given these updates 
and were allowed the time to make the changes to 
their systems. Making things more difficult is the 
fact that the Port Authority often only releases the 
schedules a few days ahead of the change. Another 
concern was that the live tests be run within one 
schedule period so that the change in schedule 
would not affect the results.   
The second engineering issue concerned 
telephony connectivity. There had to be a way to 
transfer calls from the Port Authority to the par-
ticipating systems (that were run at the participat-
ing sites, not at CMU) without slowing down or 
perturbing service to the callers.  This was 
achieved by an elaborate set of call-forwarding 
mechanisms that performed very reliably.  How-
ever, since one system was in Europe, connections 
to it were sometimes not as reliable as to the US-
based systems.

We ran each of the three systems for multiple two 
day periods over July and August 2010.  This de-
sign gave each system an equal distribution of 
weekdays and weekends, and also ensured that 
repeat-callers within the same day experienced the 
same system. 
One of the participating systems (SYS4) 
could support simultaneous calls, but the other two 
could not and the caller would receive a busy sig-
nal if the system was already in use.  This, how-
ever, did not happen very often. 
Results of hand analysis of real calls are 
shown in Table 4 alongside the results for the Con-
trol Test for easy comparison.  In the live tests we 
had an additional category of call types ? empty 
calls (0-turn calls) ? which are calls where there 
are no user turns, for example because the caller 
hung up or was disconnected before saying any-
thing.  Each system had 14 days of calls and exter-
nal daily factors may change the number of calls. 
We do suspect that telephony issues may have pre-
vented some calls from getting through to SYS3 on 
some occasions.   
Table 3 provides call duration information for 
each of the systems in both the control and live 
tests.

age number of turns per call, and average number of 
words per turn (numbers in brackets are standard devia-
tions). 
 
Each of the systems used a different speech 
recognizer.  In order to understand the impact of 
word error rate on the results, all the data were 
hand transcribed to provide orthographic transcrip-
tions of each user turn.   Summary word error sta-
tistics are shown in Table 4.   However, summary 
statistics do not show the correlation between word 
error rate and dialogue success.  To achieve this, 
following Thomson et al(2010), we computed a 
logistic regression of success against word error 
rate (WER) for each of the systems. Figure 3 
shows the regressions for the Control Tests and 
Figure 4 for the Live Tests.

In order to compare the control and live tests, 
we can calculate task completion as the percentage 
of calls that gave a correct result.  We include only 
non-empty calls (excluding 0-turn calls), and treat 
all no_info calls as being incorrect, even though 
some may be due to extraneous reasons such as the 
bus turning up (Table 5).

Table 5: Live and control test task completion (std. err).  
 
5 Discussion 
All systems had lower WER and higher task com-
pletion in the controlled test vs. the live test.  This 
agrees with past work [Raux et al2005, Ai et al
2008], and underscores the challenges of deploying 
real-world systems. 
For all systems, dialogs with controlled sub-
jects were longer than with live callers ? both in 
terms of length and number of turns.  In addition, 
for all systems, live callers used shorter utterances 
than controlled subjects.  Controlled subjects may 
be more patient than live callers, or perhaps live 
callers were more likely to abandon calls in the 
face of higher recognition error rates.   
Some interesting differences between the sys-
tems are evident in the live tests.  Looking at dia-
log durations, SYS3 used confirmations least often, 
and yielded the fastest dialogs (80s/call).  SYS1 
made extensive use of confirmations, yielding the 
most turns of any system and slightly longer dia-
logs (111s/call).  SYS4 was the most system-
directed, always collecting information one ele-
ment at a time.  As a result it was the slowest of the 
systems (126s/call), but because it often used im-
plicit confirmation instead of explicit confirmation, 
it had fewer turns/call than SYS1.   
For task completion, SYS3 performed best in 
the controlled trials, with SYS1 worst and SYS4 in 
between.  However in the live test, SYS4 per-
formed best, with SYS3 and SYS1 similar and 
worse.  It was surprising that task completion for 
SYS3 was the highest for the controlled tests yet 
among the lowest for the live tests.  Investigating 
this, we found that much of the variability in task 
completion for the live tests appears to be due to 
WER.  In the control tests SYS3 and SYS4 had 
similar error rates but the success rate of SYS3 was 
higher.  The regression in Figure 3 shows this 
clearly.   In the live tests SYS3 had a significantly 
higher word error rate and average success rate 
was much lower than in SYS4.   
It is interesting to speculate on why the rec-
ognition rates for SYS3 and SYS4 were different 
in the live tests, but were comparable in the control 
tests.  In a spoken dialogue system the architecture 
has a considerable impact on the measured word 
error rate.  Not only will the language model and 
use of dialogue context be different, but the dia-
logue design and form of system prompts will in-
fluence the form and content of user inputs.   Thus, 
word error rates do not just depend on the quality 
of the acoustic models ? they depend on the whole 
system design.  As noted above, SYS4 was more 
system-directed than SYS3 and this probably con-
tributed to the comparatively better ASR perform-
ance with live users.   In the control tests, the 
behavior of users (research lab workers) may have 
been less dependent on the manner in which users 
were prompted for information by the system.  
Overall, of course, it is user satisfaction and task 
success which matter. 
6 Corpus Availability and Evaluation 
The SDC2010 database of all logs from all systems 
including audio plus hand transcribed utterances, 
and hand defined success values is released 
through CMU?s Dialog Research Center 
(http://dialrc.org). 
One of the core goals of the Spoken Dialog 
Challenge is to not only create an opportunity for 
researchers to test their systems on a common plat-
form with real users, but also create common data 
sets for testing evaluation metrics.  Although some 
work has been done on this for the control test data 
(e.g. [Zhu et al2010]), we expect further evalua-
tion techniques will be applied to these data. 
One particular issue which arose during this 
evaluation concerned the difficulty of defining pre-
cisely what constitutes task success.  A precise de-
finition is important to developers, especially if 
reinforcement style learning is being used to opti-
mize the success.  In an information seeking task 
of the type described here, task success is straight-
forward when the user?s requirements can be satis-
fied but more difficult if some form of constraint 
relaxation is required.   For example, if the user 
6
asks if there is a bus from the current location to 
the airport ? the answer ?No.? may be strictly cor-
rect but not necessarily helpful.  Should this dia-
logue be scored as successful or not?  The answer 
?No, but there is a stop two blocks away where 
you can take the number 28X bus direct to the air-
port.? is clearly more useful to the user.  Should 
success therefore be a numeric measure rather than 
a binary decision?  And if a measure, how can it be 
precisely defined?  A second and related issue is 
the need for evaluation algorithms which deter-
mine task success automatically.   Without these, 
system optimization will remain an art rather than 
a science. 
7 Conclusions 
This paper has described the first attempt at an ex-
ercise to investigate how different spoken dialog 
systems perform on the same task.  The existing 
Let?s Go Pittsburgh Bus Information System was 
used as a task and four teams provided systems 
that were first tested in controlled conditions with 
speech researchers as users. The three most stable 
systems were then deployed ?live? with real call-
ers. Results show considerable variation both be-
tween systems and between the control and live 
tests.  Interestingly, relatively high task completion 
for controlled tests did not always predict rela-
tively high task completion for live tests.  This 
confirms the importance of testing on live callers, 
not just usability subjects. 
 The general organization and framework 
of the evaluation worked well.  The ability to route 
audio telephone calls to anywhere in the world us-
ing voice over IP protocols was critical to the suc-
cess of the challenge since it provides a way for 
individual research labs to test their in-house sys-
tems without the need to port them to a central co-
ordinating site. 
 Finally, the critical role of precise evalua-
tion metrics was noted and the need for automatic 
tools to compute them.  Developers need these at 
an early stage in the cycle to ensure that when sys-
tems are subsequently evaluated, the results and 
system behaviors can be properly compared.

Abstract
In recent years statistical dialogue systems
have gained significant attention due to their
potential to be more robust to speech recogni-
tion errors. However, these systems must also
be robust to changes in user behaviour caused
by cognitive loading. In this paper, a statistical
dialogue system providing restaurant informa-
tion is evaluated in a set-up where the sub-
jects used a driving simulator whilst talking to
the system. The influences of cognitive load-
ing were investigated and some clear differ-
ences in behaviour were discovered. In partic-
ular, it was found that users chose to respond
to different system questions and use different
speaking styles, which indicate the need for an
incremental dialogue approach.
1 Introduction
A spoken dialogue system enables a user to obtain
information while using their hands to perform some
other task, which in many cases is the user?s primary
task. A typical example is an in-car spoken dialogue
system where the spoken interaction is secondary to
the main task of driving the car (Weng et al, 2004).
This domain is particularly challenging since it in-
volves dealing with the errors caused by the varying
noise levels and changes in user behaviour caused
by the cognitive load.
A statistical approach to dialogue modelling has
been proposed as a means of automatically optimis-
ing dialogue policies. In particular, the partially ob-
servable Markov decision process (POMDP) model
for dialogue provides a representation of varying
levels of uncertainty of the user input, yielding more
robust dialogue policies (Williams and Young, 2007;
Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al, 2010).
Another thread of research deals with speech
interfaces for in-car applications, see (Baron and
Green, 2006) for a review. Past research has inves-
tigated the extent to which speaking is cognitively
less demanding than typing (Gartner et al, 2001;
Tsimhoni et al, 2004; Kun et al, 2007). In addi-
tion, considerable research has examined how driv-
ing safety is influenced by a dialogue system (Lai
et al, 2001; Lee et al, 2001; Nielsen et al, 2008).
However, to the best of our knowledge, little work
has been done to investigate the effect of the cog-
nitive load when interacting with a real conversa-
tional spoken dialogue system. The work presented
in (Mishra et al, 2004) suggests that the user speech
is more disfluent when the user is performing an-
other task. However, this work is based on a Wiz-
ard of Oz framework, where a human provides the
system?s responses. Also, a push-to-talk button was
used for every utterance which will have affected the
natural flow of the dialogue. It is important to know
if the change of cognitive load has an effect on the
speaking style and whether the system can alter its
behaviour to accommodate for this.
In this paper we try to answer these questions by
examining dialogues where users drove a car simu-
lator and talked to an open-microphone fully auto-
mated spoken dialogue system at the same time.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides an overview of the dialogue system
used and section 3 describes the evaluation set-up.
The analysis of the results is given in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 concludes the paper.

Table 1: Example dialogue task
You are looking for a cheap restaurant and it
should be in the east part of town. Make sure you
get the address of the venue.
2 System overview
The user speaks to the system, and the acoustic sig-
nal is converted by the speech recogniser into a set
of sentence hypotheses, which represents a proba-
bility distribution over all possible things that the
user might have said. The sentence hypotheses are
converted into an N-best list of dialogue acts by a
semantic decoder. Since the dialogue state cannot
be directly observed it maintains a probability dis-
tribution over all states, which is called the belief
state. The belief state is updated at every user turn
using Bayesian inference treating the input dialogue
acts as evidence. Based on belief state, the optimal
system act is selected using a policy and which is
trained automatically using reinforcement learning.
The abstract system dialogue act is converted to an
appropriate utterance by a natural language genera-
tor and then converted to speech by an HMM-based
speech synthesiser. To enable in-car speech inter-
action via mobile phone, a VoIP interface is imple-
mented. The domain is Cambridge restaurant infor-
mation with a database of about 150 venues and 7
slots that users can query.
3 Evaluation set-up
Our goal is to understand system performance
when driving. However, due to the safety restric-
tions, performance was tested using a driving simu-
lator. The following sections explain the set-up.
3.1 Car simulator
The car simulator used in the evaluation was the
same as in (Davies and Robinson, 2011). It con-
sists of a seat, a steering wheel and pedals, which
give a realistic cab-like environment for the par-
ticipants. There is also a projection screen which
largely fills the visual field of the driver. The sim-
ulation software is a modified version of Rockstar
Games? Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with over
500 km of roads. For the purpose of the evaluation,
the subjects were asked to drive on the main motor-
way, to keep the lane and not to drive over 70mph.
3.2 Subjects
For the study 28 subjects were recruited, 22 where
native speakers. Each subject had to complete three
scenarios: (1) to drive the car simulator for 10 min-
utes, (2) to talk to the system for 7 dialogues and (3)
to talk to the system for 7 dialogues while driving.
The scenarios were in counter-balanced order.
While they were driving, the speed and the road
position were recorded. If the scenario involved
talking to the system, the instructor read out the di-
alogue task (see an example in Table 1) and dialled
the phone number. In addition, the subject had the
dialogue task displayed on a small screen next to the
driving wheel. The subject talked to the system us-
ing loud speaker mode on the mobile phone.
4 Results
To examine the influence of cognitive load, the
following examinations were performed. First, we
investigate if the subjects felt any change in the cog-
nitive load (Section 4.1). Then, in Section 4.2, we
examine how the driving was influenced by the sub-
jects talking to the system. Finally, we investigate
how successfully the subjects were able to complete
the dialogue tasks while driving (Section 4.3). This
is followed with an examination of the conversa-
tional patterns that occurred when the subjects were
driving whilst talking to the system (Section 4.4).
4.1 Cognitive load
After each scenario the subjects were asked to an-
swer five questions based on the NASA-TLX self-
reporting scheme for workload measurement. They
answered by providing a rating from 1 (very easy)
to 5 (very hard). The averaged results are given
in Table 2. We performed a Kruskal test, followed
by pairwise comparisons for every scenario for each
answer and all differences are statistically signifi-
cant (p < 0.03) apart from the differences in the
frustration, the stress and the pace between talking
and talking and driving. This means that they were
clearly able to feel the change in cognitive load.

Higher speed 8% [1%, 25%]
Larger std.dev 77% [56%, 91%]
Larger entropy 85% [65%, 95%]
4.2 Driving performance
For 26 subjects we recorded position on the road
and the speed. Since these measurements vary sig-
nificantly across the subjects, for each subject we
calculated the average speed, the standard deviation
and the entropy and similarly for the average posi-
tion in the lane. For the speed, we computed how
many subjects had a higher average speed when they
were talking and driving versus when they were just
talking and similarly for the standard deviation and
the entropy. The results are given in Table 3. It
can be seen that the user?s speed is lower when they
are driving and talking, however, the increase in the
standard deviation and the entropy suggest that their
driving is more erratic. No significant differences
were observed for the road position.
4.3 Dialogue task completion
Each participant performed 14 dialogues, 7 for each
scenario. In total, there were 196 dialogues per sce-
nario. After each dialogue they told the instruc-
tor if they thought the dialogue was successful, and
this information was used to compute the subjective

Dialogues per scenario)

defined task

completion rate. In addition, all dialogues were tran-
scribed and analysed to see if the system provided
information the user asked for and hence calculate
an objective completion rate. The results are given
in Table 4. These differences are not statistically sig-
nificant due to the small sample size. However, it
can be seen that the trend is that the dialogues where
the subject was not performing another task at the
same time were more successful. Also, it is inter-
esting that the subjective scores are higher than the
objective ones. This can be explained by the fact that
the dialogue tasks were predefined and the subjects
do not always pay sufficient attention to their task
descriptions.
4.4 Conversational patterns
Given that the subjects felt the change of cognitive
load when they were talking to the system and op-
erating the car simulator at the same time, we were
interested to see if there are any changes in the dia-
logues which might suggest this.
First, we examine how well they follow the given
task on a turn-to-turn basis. For example, if the task
is to find a cheap restaurant and if at some point
in the dialogue the user says I?d like an expensive
restaurant that turn is not consistent with the task.
The results are given in Table 5 and they are statisti-
cally significant (p < 0.01).
We then examine the number of contradictions on
a turn-to-turn basis. For example, if the user says I?d
like a cheap restaurant and later on they say I?d like
76
Table 6: User obedience to system questions
1. system requests or confirms and requests
Samples Obedience
Talking 392 67.6%
Talking&Driving 390 63.9%
2. system confirms
Samples Obedience
Talking 91 73.6%
Talking&Driving 92 81.5%
an expensive restaurant the latter turn is clearly a
contradiction. The percentage of contradicting turns
is less than 1% and the difference between the sce-
narios is not statistically significant. This suggests
that while users tend to forget the task they are given
when they are driving, they still act rationally despite
the increase in the cognitive load.
The next analysis concerns the user obedience,
i.e. the extent to which subjects answer the sys-
tem questions. We grouped the system questions in
two classes. The first class represents the questions
where the system requests a value for a particular
slot, for instance What part of town are you looking
for? and the questions where the system confirms
and requests at the same time, for instance You are
looking for a cheap restaurant. What part of town
are you looking for? The second class correspond to
system confirmations, for example Did you say you
are looking for a cheap restaurant? The percent-
age of the obedient user turns per class is given in
Table 6. Due to the small sample size these results
are not statistically significant. Still, it is interest-
ing to see that when driving the subjects appear to
be more obedient to the system confirmations than
when they are just talking. When the system makes
a confirmation, the user can answer with simple yes
or no, whereas when the system requests the value
of a particular slot, the user needs to think more to
provide an answer.
The number of barge-ins, the number of filler
words and the average speech intensity vary con-
siderably among the subjects. Therefore, we aver-
age these statistics per user and examine the number
of users for which the particular measure is greater
for the scenario where they talked to the system and
drove the simulator at the same time. The results
Table 7: Analysis of measures related to the speaking
style which values are larger for Talking&Driving than
Talking
Measure % of users Conf. interval
More barge-ins 87% [69%, 96%]
More fillers 73% [54%, 88%]
Higher intensity 67% [47%, 83%]
(Table 7) show that the number of barge-ins and the
number of fillers is significantly greater for the sce-
nario when they are talking and driving and the in-
tensity on average tend to be greater.
5 Conclusion and Future work
There are several important observations arising
from this study. Firstly, dialogues with cognitively
loaded users tend to be less successful. This sug-
gests that the system should alter its behaviour to
match user behaviour and alleviate the cognitive
load in order to maintain the level of performance.
This necessitates rapid on-line adaptation of dia-
logue policies.
The second observation is that cognitively loaded
users tend to respond to some types of system ques-
tions more than others. This indicates that the user
model within a POMDP dialogue system should be
conditioned on a measure of cognitive load.
Finally, this study has found that users barge-in
and use filler words significantly more often when
they are cognitively loaded. This suggests the need
for a much richer turn-taking model which allows
the system to use back-channels and barge-in when
the user hesitates. An obvious candidate is the in-
cremental approach (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009;
DeVault et al, 2009) which allows the system to pro-
cess partial user inputs, back-channels, predict short
term user input and interrupt the user during hesita-
tions. While incremental dialogue is a growing area
of study, it has not so far been examined in the con-
text of dialogue for secondary tasks. We signpost
this as an important area for future work.

Abstract
Dialog state tracking challenge provides
a common testbed for state tracking al-
gorithms. This paper describes the SJTU
system submitted to the second Dialogue
State Tracking Challenge in detail. In
the system, a statistical semantic parser is
used to generate refined semantic hypothe-
ses. A large number of features are then
derived based on the semantic hypothe-
ses and the dialogue log information. The
final tracker is a combination of a rule-
based model, a maximum entropy and a
deep neural network model. The SJTU
system significantly outperformed all the
baselines and showed competitive perfor-
mance in DSTC 2.
1 Introduction
Dialog state tracking is important because spo-
ken dialog systems rely on it to choose proper
actions as spoken dialog systems interact with
users. However, due to automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) and spoken language understanding
(SLU) errors, it is not easy for the dialog man-
ager to maintain the true state of the dialog. In
recent years, much research has been devoted to
dialog state tracking. Many approaches have been
applied to dialog state tracking, from rule-based
to statistical models, from generative models to
discriminative models (Wang and Lemon, 2013;
Zilka et al., 2013; Henderson et al., 2013; Lee
and Eskenazi, 2013). Recently, shared research
tasks like the first Dialog State Tracking Challenge
(DSTC 1) (Williams et al., 2013) have provided
a common testbed and evaluation suite for dialog
state tracking (Henderson et al., 2013).
Compared with DSTC 1 which is in the bus
timetables domain, DSTC 2 introduces more com-
plicated and dynamic dialog states, which may
change through the dialog, in a new domain, i.e.
restaurants domain (Henderson et al., 2014). For
each turn, a tracker is supposed to output a set
of distributions for each of the three components
of the dialog state: goals, method, and requested
slots. At a given turn, the goals consists of the
user?s true required value having been revealed
for each slot in the dialog up until that turn; the
method is the way the user is trying to interact with
the system which may be by name, by constraints,
by alternatives or finished; and the requested slots
consist of the slots which have been requested by
the user and not replied by the system. For evalua-
tion in DSTC 2, 1-best quality measured by accu-
racy, probability calibration measured by L2, and
discrimination measured by ROC are selected as
featured metrics. Further details can be found in
the DSTC 2 handbook (Henderson et al., 2013).
Previous research has demonstrated the effec-
tiveness of rule-based (Zilka et al., 2013), maxi-
mum entropy (MaxEnt) (Lee and Eskenazi, 2013)
and deep neural network (DNN) (Henderson et al.,
2013) models separately. Motivated by this, the
SJTU system employs a combination of a rule-
based model, a MaxEnt and a DNN model. The
three models were first trained (if necessary) on
the training set and tested for each of the three
components of the dialog state, i.e goals, method,
and requested slots on the development set. Then,
models with the best performance for each of the
three components were selected to form a com-
bined model. Finally, the combined model was
retrained using both training set and development
set. Additionally, as the live SLU was found not
good enough with some information lost com-
pared with the live ASR, a new semantic parser
was implemented which took the live ASR as in-
put and the SJTU system used the result from the
new semantic parser instead of the live SLU.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the design of the new
318
semantic parser. Section 3 presents the rule-based
model. Section 4 describes the statistical mod-
els including the maximum entropy model and the
deep neural network model. Section 5 shows and
discusses the performance of the SJTU system. Fi-
nally, section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Semantic Parser
It was found that the live SLU provided by the or-
ganisers has poor quality. Hence, a new statistical
semantic parser is trained to parse the live ASR
hypotheses.
2.1 Semantic Tuple Classifier
The semantics of an utterance is represented in
functor form called dialogue act consisting of a
dialogue act type and a list of slot-value pairs, for
example:
request(name,food=chinese)
where ?request? is the dialogue act type,?name?
is a slot requested and ?food=chinese? is a
slot-value pair which provides some informa-
tion to the system. In DSTC 2, there are
many different dialogue act types (e.g. ?request?,
?inform?, ?deny?, etc) and different slot-value
pairs (e.g. ?food=chinese?, ?pricerange=cheap?,
?area=center?, etc), which are all called semantic
items.
A semantic tuple (e.g. act type, type-slot pair,
slot-value pair) classifier (STC) approach devel-
oped by Mairesse et al. ( 2009) is used in the SJTU
system. It requires a set of SVMs to be trained on
n-gram features from a given utterance: a multi-
class SVM is used to predict the dialogue act type,
and a binary SVM is used to predict the exis-
tence of each slot-value pair. Henderson et al. (
2012) improved this method with converting the
SVM outputs to probabilities, and approximating
the probability of a dialogue-act d of type d-type
j
with a set of slot-value pairs S by:
P (d|u) = P (d-type
j
|u)
?
sv?S
P (sv|u)
?
sv/?S
(1? P (sv|u)) (1)
where u denotes an utterance and sv runs over all
possible slot-value pairs.
2.2 Dialogue Context Features
In addition to the n-gram feature used in the orig-
inal STC parser, the dialogue context can be ex-
ploited to constrain the semantic parser. In DSTC
2, the dialogue context available contains the his-
tory information of user?s ASR hypotheses, the
system act and the other output of system (e.g.
whether there is a barge-in from the user or not,
the turn-index) and so on. In the SJTU system,
the context features from the last system act (in-
dicators for all act types and slot-value pairs on
whether they appear), an indicator for ?barge-in?
and the reciprocal of turn-index are combined with
the original n-gram feature to be the final feature
vector.
2.3 Generating Confidence Scores
For testing and predicting the dialogue act, the se-
mantic parser is applied to each of the top N ASR
hypotheses h
i
, and the set of results D
i
with m
i
distinct dialogue act hypotheses would be merged
in following way:
P (d|o) =
N
?
i=1
{
p(h
i
|o)p(d|h
i
) if d ? D
i
0 otherwise
where o is the acoustic observation, d runs over
each different dialogue act in D
i
, i = 1, ..., N ,
p(h
i
|o) denotes the ASR posterior probability of
the i-th hypothesis, p(d|h
i
) denotes the semantic
posterior probability given the i-th ASR hypoth-
esis as in equation (1). Finally, a normalization
should be done to guarantee the sum of P (d|o) to
be one.
2.4 Implementation
The STCs-based semantic parser is implemented
with linear kernel SVMs trained using the Lib-
SVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011). The SVM
misclassification cost parameters are optimised in-
dividually for each SVM classifier by performing
cross-validations on the training data.
3 Rule-based Model
In this section, the rule-based model which is
slightly different from the focus tracker (Hender-
son et al., 2013) and HWU tracker (Wang, 2013) is
described. The idea of the rule-based model is to
maintain beliefs based on basic probability opera-
tions and a few heuristic rules that can be observed
on the training set. In the following the rule-based
model for joint goals, method and requested slots
are described in detail.
319
3.1 Joint Goals
For slot s, the i-th turn and value v, p
+
s,i,v
(p
?
s,i,v
) is
used to denote the sum of all the confidence scores
assigned by the SLU to the user informing or af-
firming (denying or negating) the value of slot s is
v. The belief of ?the value of slot s being v in the
i-th turn? denoted by b
s,i,v
is defined as follows.
? If v 6= ?None?,
b
s,i,v
= (b
s,i?1,v
+ p
+
s,i,v
(1? b
s,i?1,v
))
(1? p
?
s,i,v
?
?
v
?
6=v
p
+
s,i,v
?
)
? Otherwise,
b
s,i,v
= 1?
?
v
?
6=?None?
b
s,i,v
?
In particular, when i = 0, b
s,0,v
= 1 if v =
?None?, otherwise 0. The motivation here comes
from HWU tracker (Wang, 2013) that only p
+
s,?,v
positively contributes to the belief of slot s being
v, and both p
+
s,?,v
?
(v
?
6= v) and p
?
s,?,v
contribute to
the belief negatively.
3.2 Method
For the i-th turn, p
i,m
is used to denote the sum of
all the confidence scores assigned by the SLU to
method m. Then the belief of ?the method being
m in the i-th turn? denoted by b
i,m
is defined as
follows.
? If m 6= ?none?,
b
i,m
= b
i?1,m
(1?
?
m
?
6=?none?
p
i,m
?
) + p
i,m
? Otherwise,
b
i,m
= 1?
?
m
?
6=?none?
b
i,m
?
In particular, b
0,m
= 0 when i = 0 and m 6=
?none?. An explanation of the above formula
is given by Zilka et al. (2013). The idea is also
adopted by the focus tracker (Henderson et al.,
2013).
3.3 Requested Slots
For the i-th turn and slot r, p
i,r
is used to denote
the sum of all the confidence scores assigned by
the SLU to r is one of the requested slots. Then
the belief of ?r being one of the requested slots in
the i-th turn? denoted by b
i,r
is defined as follows.
? If i = 1, or system has at least one of
the following actions: ?canthelp?, ?offer?,
?reqmore?, ?confirm-domain?, ?expl-conf?,
?bye?, ?request?,
b
i,r
= p
i,r
? Otherwise,
b
i,r
= b
i?1,r
(1? p
i,r
) + p
i,r
This rule is a combination of the idea of HWU
tracker (Wang, 2013) and an observation from the
labelled data that once system has some certain ac-

turn should be reset.
4 Statistical Model
In this section, two statistical models, one is the
MaxEnt model, the other is the DNN model, are
described.
4.1 Features
The performance of statistical models is highly de-
pendent on the feature functions.
Joint Goals
For slot s, the i-th turn and value v, the feature
functions designed for joint goals are listed below.

scores assigned by the SLU to the user in-
forming the value of slot s is v.

type being u
j
(1 ? j ? 17).
? f
10
, bias(i) = 1.
In particular, all above feature function are 0
when i ? 0.
Requested Slots
For the i-th turn and slot r, the feature functions
designed for requested slots are listed below.
? f
1
, slu(i, r) = the sum of all the scores
assigned by the SLU to r being one of the
requested slots.
? f
2
, rank(i, r) = the sum of all the recipro-
cal rank of the scores assigned by the SLU to
r being one of the requested slots.
? f

by the rule-based model.
? f
4
, bias(i, r) = 1
In particular, all above feature function are 0
when i ? 0.
4.2 Maximum Entropy Model
Total 6 MaxEnt models (Bohus and Rudnicky,
2006) are employed, four models for the joint
goals, one for the method and one for the re-
quested slots. The Maximum Entropy model is an
efficient means that models the posterior of class
y given the observations x:
P (y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp (?
T
f(y,x))
Where Z(x) is the normalization constant. ? is
the parameter vector and f(y,x) is the feature
vector.
The models for the joint goals are implemented
for four informable slots (i.e. area, food, name
and pricerange) separately. In the k-th turn, for
every informable slot s and its value v, i.e. slot-
value pair in SLU, the MaxEnt model for the cor-
responding slot is used to determine whether the
value v for the slot s in the user goals is right or
not. The input consists of 160 features
1
which
are selected from the feature functions described
in section 4.1 Joint Goals:
{f
34
}
i=k
?
?
k?2?i?k
{f
1
, ? ? ? , f
15
,f
28
, ? ? ? , f
33
}
Where i is the turn index . The output of the model
is the confidence score that the value v for the slot
s is right.
In the k-th turn, the model for the method is
used to determine which way the user is trying to
interact with the system. The input consists of 97
features which are selected from the feature func-
1
For the feature function whose range is not 1 dimen-
sion, the number of features defined by the feature function
is counted as the number of dimensions rather than 1. For
example, the number of features defined by f
28
is 17.

}
and the output consists of five confidence scores
that the method belongs to every one of the five
ways (i.e. by name, by constraints, by alternatives,
finished and none).
The model for the requested slots is used to de-
termine whether the requestable slot r in the SLU
?request(slot)? is truly requested by the user or not
in the k-th turn. The input consists of 10 features
which are selected from the feature functions de-
scribed in section 4.1 Requested Slots:

and the output is the confidence score that r is truly
requested by the user in this turn.
The parameters of the 6 MaxEnt models are op-
timised separately through maximizing the likeli-
hood of the training data. The training process is
stopped when the likelihood change is less than
10
?4
.
4.3 Deep Neural Network Model
4 DNNs for joint goals (one for each slot), 1 for
method and 1 for requested slots are employed.
All of them have similar structure with Sigmoid
for hidden layer activation and Softmax for out-
put layer activation. As shown in figure 1, each
DNN has 3 hidden layers and each layer has 64
nodes. DNNs take the feature set (which will be
described in detail later) of a certain value of goal,
method, or requested slots as the input, then out-
put two values (donated by X and Y ), through the
hidden layer processing, and finally the confidence
of the value can be got by
e

Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM was applied to pre-
train DNNs and Stochastic Gradient Descent with
cross-entropy criterion to fine-tune DNNs. For the
fine-tuning process, 3/4 of the data was used for
training and 1/4 for validation.
5 Experiments
DSTC 2 provides a training dataset of 1612 dia-
logues (11677 utterances) and a development set
of 506 dialogues (3934 utterances). The training
data was first used to train the semantic parser
and the MaxEnt and the DNN models for internal
system development as shown in section 5.1 and
5.2. These systems were tested on the develop-
ment data. Once the system setup and parameters
were determined, the training and development set
were combined together to train the final submit-
ted system. The final system was then tested on
the final evaluation data as shown in section 5.3.
5.1 Effect of the STC Semantic Parser
In DSTC 2, as the live semantic information was
found to be poor, two new semantic parsers were
then trained as described in section 2. One used
the top ASR hypothesis n-gram features and the
other one employed additional system feedback
features (the last system act, ?barge-in? and turn-
index).
Table 1 shows the performance of two new se-
mantic parser in terms of the precision, recall,
323

F-score of top dialogue act hypothesis and the
Item Cross Entropy (ICE) (Thomson et al., 2008)
which measures the overall quality of the confi-
dences distribution of semantic items (the less the
better). The baseline is the original live seman-
tic hypotheses, ?1-best? (row 3) represents the se-
mantic parser trained on the top ASR hypothesis
with n-gram feature, and ?sys fb? (row 4) rep-
resents the semantic parser added with the sys-
tem feedback features. The STC semantic parsers
significantly improve the quality of semantic hy-
potheses compared with baseline in the score of
precision, recall, F-score and ICE. And the parser
using context features (row 4) scored better than
the other one (row 3).
The improved semantic parsers are expected to
also yield better performance in dialogue state
tracking. Hence, the parsers were used in focus
baseline provided by the organiser. As shown in
Joint Goals Method Requested
baseline 0.6121 0.8303 0.8936
1-best 0.6613 0.8764 0.8987
+ sys fb 0.6765 0.8764 0.9297
Table 2: Results for focus baseline tracker with
different parsers
table 2, the new parsers achieved consistent im-
provement on the accuracy of joint goals, method
and requested slots. So the semantic hypotheses
of parser using the system feedback features was
used for later development.
5.2 Internal System Development
Table 3 shows the the results of rule-based model,
the MaxEnt model and the DNN model on the de-
velopment set. From the table we can see that
the DNN model has the best performance for joint
goals, the MaxEnt model has the best performance
for method and the rule-based model has the best
performance for requested slots. So the combined
model is a combination of those three models, one
for one of the three components where it has the
best performance, that is, the rule-based model
for requested slots, the MaxEnt model for method,
and the DNN model for joint goals.
Joint Goals Method Requested
Rule-based 0.6890 0.8955 0.9668
MaxEnt 0.6741 0.9079 0.9665
DNN 0.6906 0.8991 0.9661
Table 3: Performance of three tracking models
5.3 Evaluation Performance
The official results of the challenge are publicly
available and the SJTU team is team 7. Entry
0, 1, 2, 3 of team 7 is the combined model, the
rule-based model, the DNN model and the Max-
Ent model respectively. They all used the new se-
mantic parser based on live ASR hypotheses. En-
try 4 of team 7 is also a combined model but it
does not use the new semantic parser and takes the
live SLU as input.
Table 4 shows the results on the final evalua-
tion test set. As expected, the semantic parser does
work, and the combined model has the best perfor-
mance for joint goals and method, however, that
is not true for requested slots. Notice that on the
development set, the difference of the accuracy of
requested slots among the 3 models is significantly
smaller than that of joint goals and method. One
reasonable explanation is that one cannot claim
that the rule-based model has better performance
for requested slots than the MaxEnt model and the
DNN model only with an accuracy advantage less
than 0.1%.

As ROC metric is only comparable between sys-
tems of similar accuracy, only accuracy and L2
are compared. The results of the combined model
is competitive for all the three components, espe-
cially for joint goals.
5.4 Post Evaluation Analysis
Two strategies and two kinds of features were
added to the MaxEnt model for the requested slots
after DSTC 2 based on some observations on the
training set and development set. The first strategy
is that the output for the requested slots of the first
turn is set to empty by force. The second strategy
is that the output of the confidence is additionally
multiplied by (1?C
f
), where C
f
denotes the con-
fidence given by the MaxEnt model to the method
of current turn being finished. As for the two kinds
of features, one is the slot indicator and the other
is the acttype-slot tuple. They are defined as
2
:
? f
5
, (f
5,1
, f
5,2
, ? ? ? , f
5,8
), where f
5,j
,
slot indicator(i, r, s
j
) = 1 if the index of the
slot r is j, i.e. s
j
= r, otherwise 0.
? f
6
, (f
6,1
, f
6,2
, ? ? ? , f
6,33
), where f
6,j
,
user act slot(i, r, t
j
) = the sum of all the
scores assigned by the SLU to the j-th user
acttype-slot tuple t
j
. The acttype-slot tuple is
the combination of dialog act type and possi-
ble slot, e.g. inform-food, confirm-area.
There are 33 user acttype-slot tuples.
2
The feature number is consistent with that in section 4.1.
? f
7
, (f
7,1
, f
7,2
, ? ? ? , f
7,46
), where f
7,j
,
sys act slot(i, r, t
j
) = the number of occur-
rences of the j-th machine acttype-slot tuple
t
j
in the dialog acts. There are 46 machine
acttype-slot tuples.
With those strategies and features, the Max-
Ent model achieved an accuracy of 0.9769 for the
requested slots, which is significantly improved
compared with the submitted system.
6 Conclusion
This paper describes the SJTU submission for
DSTC 2 in detail. It is a combined system con-
sisting of a rule-based model, a maximum entropy
model and a deep neural network model with a
STC semantic parser. The results show that the
SJTU system is competitive and outperforms most
of the other systems in DSTC 2 on test datasets.
Post evaluation analysis reveal that there is still
room for improvement by refining the features.
