Abstract
This paper describes a system for process-
ing economic documents written in the an-
cient Sumerian language. The system is
application-oriented and takes advantage
of the simplicity of ancient economy. We
have developed an ontology for a selected
branch of economic activities. We trans-
late the documents into a meaning repre-
sentation language by means of a semantic
grammar. The meaning representation lan-
guage is constructed in a way that allows
us to handle massive ambiguity caused by:
the specifics of the Sumerian writing sys-
tem (signs? polyvalence, lack of mid-word
signs), our incomplete knowledge of the
Sumerian language and frequent damages
of documents. The system is augmented
with the capability of processing docu-
ments whose parts describe concepts not
included in the ontology and grammar. As
an effect we obtain a structural description
of the documents contents in the mean-
ing representation language, ready to use
in historical research.
1 Introduction
Sumerians lived from prehistoric times until late
3rd millennium BC in lower Mesopotamia (mod-
ern Iraq). Sumer was the first highly developed ur-
ban civilisation, which used cuneiform script. Dur-
ing the period of the 3rd dynasty of Ur (2100 BC-
2000 BC), whose power extended as far as present

Iraq and western Iran, the state introduced a cen-
trally planned economy with an extensive bureau-
cratic apparatus.
Civil servants reported on clay tablets agri-
culture and factory production, lists of worker
salaries, summaries of executed work, distribution
of commodities, goods, animals etc., lists of sac-
rificed animals, travel diets and other economical
information.
Archaeologists dug out about 100000 of tablets
from that period (known also as the Neo-Sumerian
period). The corpus of 44365 tablets (as of March
26, 2008) is available in electronic version in the
database of Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative
(CDLI, 2006), run by the University of California
in Los Angeles and Max Planck Institute for the
History of Science. Tablets are stored in the form
of Latin transliteration, often accompanied by pho-
tographs or drawings (which are irrelevant for us).
Economic documents are an essential source of
information about ancient Sumer. The corpus con-
tains crucial information about economic, social
and political history of the state, as well as its po-
litical system and administration structure. The
sources of this type provide the most complete in-
formation about the daily life of those days. For
more information about the economy of the Ur III
kingdom see for example (Stepien, 1996; Shar-
lach, 2004; Steinkeller, 1987).
As more and more Neo-Sumerian economic
documents were published, the problem arose of
searching for documents relevant to the investi-
gated topic, and the problem of representing the
content of a large number of documents in a con-
cise way.
As a solution to these problems we propose
a knowledge base, that would assist in prosopo-
graphic (identification of Sumerian officials), his-

torical and philological research. For our studies,
we selected a subcorpus of 11891 documents con-
cerning distribution of domestic animals.
The design of our system was determined by
two factors: the characteristics of the underlying
corpus and and the functionality needed by histo-
rians who are end-users of the system.
We developed an ontology for the selected sub-
corpus. It determins the structure of the knowledge
base. It also defines the components of the mean-
ing representation language, which we use for stor-
ing data in the knowledge base.
We translate the documents into the meaning
representation language by means of a semantic
grammar. The grammar has the strength equal to a
regular language. Grammar symbols are equipped
with semantic values that carry information in-
cluded in the texts. Semantic values are generated
during the parsing process by means of semantic
attachments to grammar symbols.
The meaning representation language is con-
structed in a way that allows it to handle ambi-
guities caused by: the inherent ambiguity of the
Sumerian writing system (signs? polyvalence, lack
of mid-word signs), our incomplete knowledge of
the Sumerian language and frequent damages of
tablets.
The system is augmented with the capability of
processing documents whose parts describe con-
cepts not included in the ontology and grammar.
We keep the ontology itself small (circa 30 con-
cepts) because we include in it only concepts that
are commonly found in documents. This approach
is determined by the needs of the intended users:
historians need a structural representation for typi-
cal information contained in the documents, which
would provide insight into the structure and ac-
tivity of Sumerian administration and analyse it
by means of statistical methods; rare, untypical
phrases are thoroughly examined and interpreted
manually.
The paper is organised as follows: In Section
2 we describe the Neo-Sumerian Ur III Economic
Text Corpus. In Section 3 we present the ontol-
ogy for documents. In Sections 4, 5, 6 we define
accordingly: the meaning representation language,
grammar, representation semantic values of gram-
mar symbols and semantic attachments. In Section
8 we show how to extract transaction descriptions
from the documents. In Section 9 we present ap-
plications of the system. Section 10 draws conclu-
sions.
2 Ur III text corpus
Sumerian writing system was like a rebus, with-
out punctuation signs, also with large amount of
polyvalential signs. According to the rule of poly-
valence one sign could, depending on the context,
be read differently. For example the DU sign mean-
ing? a leg, could have also other translations like:
gin ? to go, gub ? to stand straight, tum2 ?
to bring, etc.
Phonetical values of signs are most often sin-
gle syllables. Simple words are written by single
ideograms equipped with phonetically written af-
fixes. More complicated terms can be represented
by combinations of multiple signs. Due to lack
of mid-word signs and agglutinative character of
the Sumerian language, it is hard to identify if we
read a word or a phrase, and define its borders in
the text. For more information about the Sumerian
language see (Labat and Malbran-Labat, 1988).
The fact that administrative documents are writ-
ten in bureaucratic language which is full of nota-
370

tion abbreviations, lacks most of grammatical af-
fixes and does not have uniformed spelling for non-
Sumerian words, makes the situation even more
complicated.
Texts are often physically damaged. Dam-
ages can concern one or many following signs.
Sometimes many following lines are illegible. In
the transliterations damages are marked by spe-
cial symbols or descriptions in English, German,
French, etc., depending on translator?s nationality.
Fig. 1 presents the contents of a typical Sume-
rian document. This documents reports the trans-
fers of lambs from 3 people to ab-ba-sa6-ga,
an official of the Ur III state. They took place in
the 23th day of the month sze-kin-ku5 in the
year when the high priest of goddess Innana was
elevated to office.
3 Ontology
As we mentioned above, we examine the subcor-
pus of documents concerning distribution of breed-
ing animals. The distribution was organised in
the form of transactions. During each transaction
one Person, called Supplier, transfers a Num-
ber of animals to another Person, called Receiver.
Animal description consists of information like:
species, age, gender, fodder, etc. Person is de-
scribed by means of his/her Name, Filiation, Job
and/or Nationality. Apart from the Supplier and
Receiver, other Persons might have assisted in the
transaction:
giri3 PN Middleman between Supplier and and
Receiver
mu-DU PN Person on whose account the transac-
tion took place, Receiver is probably Mu Du?s
representative
mu PN-sze3 Person in whose name the Receiver
or Supplier acted.
kiszib3 PN Person who sealed the document
PN maszkim Overseer of the transaction
bala PN Person who provides goods as royal tax.
The roles are named after the Sumerian phrases
used to introduce them PN states for Personal
Name), their meaning is still studied by sumerol-
ogists. One of applications of our research is to
provide more facts on their meaning.
There are a few kinds of Summaries of various
animal types in the documents, denoted by con-
cepts: Szu Lagab, Szu Nigin as well as single
Number. Dates of transactions are also provided.

The dependencies between concepts have
meronymical nature. They witness the fact that one
object is a part, property, attribute or description of
another one. Fig. 2 presents the diagram of depen-
dencies between concepts.
Animals, roles and dates are transaction at-
tributes. Yet, often one document describes many
transactions and their common attribute values are
written only once in the document. As a result,
transactions are entangled and the individual trans-
action do not appear explicitly until the very last
phase of processing.
4 Meaning representation language
The meaning representation language represents
concepts included in the data and dependencies be-
tween them. Syntax of the language is defined as
follows: We have a set of constants and a set of
predicate names. Constants play the role of labels
for entities described in the data. Predicates con-
sist of lists of one or more arguments. Number of
arguments for a given predicate is not fixed. Predi-
cates represent relations on finite sequences of en-
tities. Names of most predicates are identical to
the names of the related ontological concepts. The
first argument of a predicate is an object which be-
longs to the ontological concept denoted by predi-
cate name.
Predicates are atomic formulas. Compound for-
mulas are composed of one or more atomic formu-
lae connected by conjunctions and/or disjunctions.
We do not use quantifiers, functions and negation.
Fig. 3 we provide our example tablet writ-
ten in formal language. Number, Animal,
Name, Person, Receiver, Year, Document,
etc. denote corresponding ontological categories.
q
1
, q
2
, a
1
,m
1
, del
1
, etc. represent objects de-
scribed in the text.
For example:
? Day(d
1
, 23) means that d
1
is a Day and its
number is 23.
? Name(n
1
,ur-mes) means that n
1
is a Name
written as ur-mes.
? Job(j
1
,ensi2) means that j
1
is a Job called
ensi2.
? Name(n
1
,ur-mes) ? Job(j
1
,ensi2) ?
Person(m
1
, n
1
, j
1
) means that n
1
is a Name
written as ur-mes and j
1
is a Job called
ensi2 and m
1
is a Person described by n
1
and j
1
.
? NumberAnimalName(nam
1
, q
1
, a
1
, s
1
)
refers to the triple of Number, Animal
and Supplier referenced by q
1
, a
1
, s
1
and
represented by nam
1
.
? Year(y
1
, AS5)?Year(y
1
, IS4) means that y
1
is 5th Year of reign of king Amar-Sin or 4th
Year of reign of king Ibbi-Sin.
5 Syntax analysis
From the linguistic point of view, an economic
document is a single sentence, whose length may
vary from below 50 up to more than 5000 signs.
The documents from the subcorpus are in general
words of a regular language. Connections between
words and phrases are determined by their posi-
tions in text. Taking this into account we decided
to perform the syntax analysis by means of a gram-
mar that generates a regular language.
We use semantic categories (such as divine
names, personal names, job names, year names
etc.) to describe dependencies between words.
Apart from describing word connections, grammar
plays the role of a lexicon and is used for determin-
ing word borders.
372
Morphological analysis is not needed, due to the
agglutinative character of Sumerian and absence
of most grammatical suffixes in economic docu-
ments.
We define the grammar as follows:
G = (?, N,X
I
, R,+,?)
where
? ? is a finite set of terminal symbols,
? N is a finite set of non-terminal symbols.
? X
I
? N is the start-symbol of G.
? R is a finite set of production rules. Each pro-
duction has the form A ? ? or A ? ?+,
where A is a non-terminal and ? is a se-
quence of terminals and non-terminals and
? ? ? ? N . A ? ?+ is a shortcut for an
infinite set of rules: A ? ?,A ? ??,A ?
???, . . . . We call such rules accumulation
rules.
? ? is binary relation on??N such thatA ? B
if and only if there is a rule A ? ? in R
such that B belongs to ? or there is a rule
A ? B+.
? ? is an irreflexive and transitive partial order.
This guarantees that G is recursion-free and
generates a regular language.
We will call every subsequence parsed to a
grammar symbol a phrase.
Proposition 1 Language L can be generated by a
grammar of the form defined above if and only if L
is regular.
Names of the symbols in the grammar reflect the
concept names. Example rules:
Head Body
Name ::= ur mes
Person ::= Name Job
Person ::= Name
Person ::= Job
NumberAnimal ::= Number Animal
NumberAnimalList ::= Animal +
We represent all the possible derivation trees for
a given text and grammar by means of a directed
acyclic graph whose edges are labelled by gram-
mar symbols. We call it a chart.
The text is a sequence of signs. We represent
this sequence as an oriented graph which is a list
with signs as edges. Vertices of this graph are num-
bers pointing to the position in text. Then for each
rule we find all paths in the graph with sequences
of edge labels that match the body of the rule, and
add to the graph new edges from the beginnings
to the ends of those paths, and label them with the
rule head. We will denote an edge labelled ? from
vertex i to vertex j by ?
i,j
.
6 Semantic analysis
In case of an ambiguous grammar (as in our case),
the number of possible syntax derivation trees may
be exponential in the sequence length. The concept
of chart is intended to be their common, compact
representation. The number of possible seman-
tic values of the sequence is equal to the number
of syntax derivation trees. That is why we can-
not represent them directly. Instead, we distribute
the semantic values across the chart. Our method
resembles to the approach known in the literature
as Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al,
1999)
The formulas of the meaning representation lan-
guage are spread across the chart. Consider the
edge ?
i,j
of chart. This edge was created as the
result of parsing a phrase. The phrase describes
an entity. We represent this entity by means of a
constant a
?,i,j
. We describe its properties derived
from the phrase by the formula of meaning repre-
sentation language. Such a formula is composed
out of constants which represent entities and pred-
icates that describe syntactic structure connecting
them. We name this formula the semantic value of
the grammar symbol and denote it as [[?]]
i,j
.
The formula [[?]]
i,j
has the following structure:
n
?
k=1
p
k
(a

,
where ?
k

are labels corresponding to the symbols
in the body of the rule used to create the edge ?

.
Each [[?

On Fig. 4 we present an example a chart. The
names of predicates associated with the grammar
symbols are usually identical to their names. The
first argument of each predicate is a constant that
represents an entity described by the phrase. In-
dices of this constant identify the edge into which
this phrase was parsed.
On Fig. 5 we show semantic values for some
of the edges for chart on Fig. 4. For exam-
ple the semantic value of the edge Name
4,6
(de-
noted as [[Name]]
4,6
) is calculated to be the for-
mula Name(a
Name,4,6
, a
ga,4,5
, a
mu,5,6
), because the
constant a
ga,4,5
refers to the edge ga
4,5
and a
mu,5,6
to mu
5,6
.
Ambiguous phrases may be parsed to a num-
ber of predicates. Each predicate generated for
a given subsequence is a possible description
of an entity. That is why we point that en-
tity by the same constant in each predicate (con-
sider for example semantic value of an edge
[[NumberAnimalName]]
1,6
).
We connect different possible subsequence in-
terpretations using disjunction. Domain knowl-
edge provides constraints on relations. These con-
straints may, for example, make the disjunction
mutually exclusive.
We represent the semantic value of a symbol
generated by an accumulation rule as a graph,
whose vertices are constants that are arguments of
the predicate. Each path from the first to the last
374
vertex in such a graph represents a list of predi-
cate arguments. The predicates are connected by
disjunction.
Semantic values of grammar symbols are con-
structed using semantic attachments of grammar
rules. Semantic attachments are functions that
compose semantics of greater objects out of the se-
mantics of smaller ones. Predicate sets associated
with edges of chart are arguments and values for
these functions.
Upon the end of the parsing process we obtain
an edge labelled by the start symbol of the gram-
mar. Its semantic value is a formula which contains
every possible translation of the entire text into the
meaning representation language.
There are three types of rules that occur during
the corpus processing:
? Rules that make up the lexicon
Name ::= ur mes
Name(var
Name
, var
ur
, var
mes
)
? Rules that describe the document structure
Person ::= Name Job
Person(var
Person
, var
Name
, var
Job
)
Person ::= Name
Person(var
Person
, var
Name
)
Person ::= Job
Person(var
Person
, var
Job
)
? Rules that introduce domain knowledge
(numbers, year names etc)
YearGod ::= d inanna
{AS04(var
YearGod
), AS05(var
YearGod
))}
Year ::= mu en YearGod Verb
{p(var
Year
) : p ? val
YearGod
? val
Verb
}
var
Name
is a variable, whose index is an edge la-
belled by the symbol Name. val
YearGod
is a set
of predicate names connected with the symbol
YearGod.
7 Incomplete ontology and damaged
documents
In every corpus, there is a number of phrases that
cannot be expressed using concepts typical for that
corpus. These phrases are rare, irregular and de-
void of characteristic contexts.
In order to obtain completely parsed documents
we must develop a semantic representation for
documents we partially do not understand. We
close the ontology with the Other Information
concept, which is treated as a transaction attribute
and refers to information not included in the rest of
concepts.
Parser recognises phrases it does not under-
stand using the following heuristics: Boundaries
of transaction attributes are correlated with verse
boundaries. If the parser does not recognise the
content of a verse it decides that this verse contains
Other Information.
Apart from being not understood the texts are
often damaged. There are several types of damages
in documents.
When a single sign is illegible, it is denoted in
the document as x. The parser considers the x
symbol as a wildcard that may be matched with
any terminal symbol.
When a part of a verse is broken, it is denoted in
the document by [...]. We estimate the number
of signs in the broken verse counting the number
of signs in the other verses in the document. Then
we replace the [...] symbol by a sequence of x
symbols.
We do not estimate precise contents of broken
phrases, we only determine their role in the docu-
ment and ontological category. This allows us to
avoid combinatorial explosion while parsing dam-
aged documents.
When a whole verse or a number of verses is
broken we assume that they have syntactic struc-
ture of a typical verse or contain Other Informa-
tion.
8 Transaction Extraction
After performing the semantic analysis we know
the concepts used in the document, its topic and
structure. Now, we extract transactions from the
documents.
Transactions extracted from our example docu-
ment (Fig. 1) are presented on Fig. 6. Extracted
transactions are are represented as edges of chart
and they compose a formula of meaning represen-
tation language. For unequivocal tablets this for-
mula is a simple conjunction of transaction predi-
cates, whilst ambiguous documents provide trans-
actions which are connected by conjunction and
disjunction as well.
While extracting transactions, we analyse docu-
ment summaries: we correlate the number of ani-
mals with their quantity written down in the docu-
ment summary. This allows us to reduce the num-
ber of ambiguities generated by document dam-
ages and specifics of writing system.
We extracted 68619 transactions from the se-
lected subcorpus with precision 86% and recall
90%.

9 Applications
Our methodology proved its usefulness in several
applications.
The first, simple, but powerful and needed ap-
plication is document retrieval. The system allows
us to retrieve documents that satisfy queries con-
cerning concepts and structure of the texts.
It is worth mentioning that due to the script
polyvalence, text damages and editor records
mixed with Sumerian text, matching a sequence of
signs in a document is not a trivial task.
Using the transaction based knowledge repre-
sentation we found pairs of documents that contain
information about the same transaction. This task
is important due to the fact that this is the way to
follow the distribution process and administration
activity.
The system provides help also in the tasks of:
identification o Sumerian officials (prosopogra-
phy); determining relations between Sumerian of-
ficials in terms of number of commodities that are
transferred between them; classification of types of
documents generated by Sumerian administration;
research on Sumerian language itself.
10 Conclusions
We presented an ontology driven methodology for
processing Sumerian economic documents. We
applied it with a success to sumerological research
problems.
We plan to extend the ontology, grammar and
lexicon so that the system could process the whole
corpus of Neo-Sumerian economic documents. It
will allow us to construction of the model of Sume-
rian economics. We will estimate the contents of
unavailable documents be means of statistic based
approximation and machine learning methods.
Language characteristics have little influence on
the system construction, so nothing prevents the
system form being applied to narrow subject mat-
ter corpora written in other languages. Especially
the problems of incomplete ontologies and partial
data (caused for example by damages done to doc-
uments) are independent from the language char-
acteristics.

Abstract
The aim of this paper is to discuss difficul-
ties involved in adopting an existing sys-
tem of semantic roles in a grammar engi-
neering task. Two typical repertoires of se-
mantic roles are considered, namely, Verb-
Net and Sowa?s system. We report on ex-
periments showing the low inter-annotator
agreement when using such systems and
suggest that, at least in case of languages
with rich morphosyntax, an approximation
of semantic roles derived from syntactic
(grammatical functions) and morphosyn-
tactic (grammatical cases) features of ar-
guments may actually be beneficial for ap-
plications such as textual entailment.
1 Introduction
The modern notion of semantic ? or thematic ?
roles stems from the lexical semantic work of
Gruber 1965 (his thematic relations) and Fillmore
1968 (so-called deep cases), and was popularised
by Jackendoff 1972, but traces of this concept may
already be found in the notion of k?araka in the
writings of the Sanskrit grammarian P?an
.
ini (4th
century BC); see, e.g., Dowty 1991 for a histori-
cal introduction. Fillmore?s deep cases are Agen-
tive, Dative, Instrumental, Factive, Locative, Ob-
jective, as well as Benefactive, Time and Comi-
tative, but many other sets of semantic roles may
be found in the literature; for example, Dalrym-
ple 2001, p. 206, cites ? after Bresnan and Kan-
erva 1989 ? the following ranked list of thematic
roles: Agent, Benefactive, Recipient/Experiencer,
Instrument, Theme/Patient, Locative.
In Natural Language Processing (NLP),
one of the most popular repertoires of se-
mantic roles is that of VerbNet (Kipper et al.
2000; http://verbs.colorado.edu/
~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html),
a valence lexicon of English based on Levin?s
(1993) classification of verbs according to the
diathesis phenomena they exhibit. The VerbNet
webpage states that it contains 3769 lemmata
divided into 5257 senses. There are 30 semantic
roles used in VerbNet 3.2,
1
including such stan-
dard roles as Agent, Beneficiary and Instrument,
but also more specialised roles such as Asset (for
quantities), Material (for stuff things are made
of) or Pivot (a theme more central to an event
than the theme expressed by another argument).
This resource is widely used in NLP, and it was
one of the main lexical resources behind the
Unified Lexicon of English (Crouch and King,
2005), a part of an LFG-based semantic parser
(Crouch and King, 2006) employed in tasks such
as question answering (Bobrow et al., 2007a) and
textual entailment (Bobrow et al., 2007b).
Another system of semantic roles considered
here is that developed by Sowa (2000; http:
//www.jfsowa.com/krbook/) for the pur-
pose of knowledge representation in artificial in-
telligence. There are 18 thematic roles proposed in
Sowa 2000, p. 508, including standard roles such
as Agent, Recipient and Instrument, but also 4
temporal and 4 spatial roles. Unlike in case of
VerbNet, there is no corpus or dictionary showing
numerous examples of the acutal use of such roles
? just a few examples are given (on pp. 506?510).
On the other hand, principles of assigning the-
matic roles to arguments may be formulated as a
decision tree, which should make the process of
semantic role labelling more efficient.
But why should we care about semantic roles at
all? From the NLP perspective, the main reason is
that they are useful in tasks approximating reason-
ing, such as textual entailment. Take the follow-
1
Table 2 on the VerbNet webpage lists 21 roles, of which
Actor is not actually used; the 10 roles which are used but not
listed there are Goal, Initial_Location (apart from Location),
Pivot, Reflexive, Result, Trajectory and Value, as well as Co-
Agent, Co-Patient and Co-Theme.

?An anonymous person wrote a paper.?

anonymous(p) ? write(p, a)
b. ?e?a?p article(a) ? person(p) ?
anonymous(p) ? write(e) ?
agent(e, p) ? patient(e, a)
While it is clear that (2) follows from (1), this
inference is not obvious in (1a)?(2a); making such
an inference would require an additional mean-
ing postulate relating the two write predicates of
different arities. In contrast, when dependents
of the predicate are represented via separate se-
mantic roles, as in the neo-Davidsonian (1b)?(2b)
(cf. Parsons 1990), the inference from (1b) to (2b)
is straightforward and follows from general in-
ference rules of first-order logic; nothing special
needs to be said about the writing events.
Also, building on examples from Bobrow
et al. 2007b, p. 20, once we know that flies is a
possible hyponym of travels, we may infer Ed
travels to Boston from Ed flies to Boston. Given
representations employing semantic roles, e.g.,
?efly(e)?agent(e, ed)?destination(e, boston)
and ?e travel(e) ? agent(e, ed) ?
destination(e, boston), all that is needed to
make this inference is a general inference schema
saying that, if P is a hypernym of Q, then
?eQ(e) ? P (e). A more complicated set of
inference schemata would be necessary if the
neo-Davidsonian approach involving semantic
roles were not adopted.
2 Problems with standard repertoires of
semantic roles
As noted by Bobrow et al. 2007b, p. 20, standard
VerbNet semantic roles may in some cases make
inference more difficult. For example, in Ed trav-
els to Boston, VerbNet identifies Ed as a Theme,
while in Ed flies to Boston ? as an Agent. The so-
lution adopted there was to use ?a backoff strategy
where fewer role names are used (by projecting
down role names to the smaller set)?.
In order to verify the usefulness of well-known
repertoires of semantic roles, we performed a us-
ability study of the two sets of semantic roles de-
scribed above. The aim of this study was to es-
timate how difficult it would be to create a cor-
pus of sentences with verbs? arguments annotated
with such semantic roles. For this purpose, 37
verbs were selected more or less at random and
843 instances of arguments of these verbs (in 393
sentences, but only one verb was considered in
each sentence) were identified in a corpus. In two
experiments, the same 7 human annotators were
asked to label these arguments with VerbNet and
with Sowa?s semantic roles.
In both cases interannotator agreement (IAA)
was below our expectations, given the fact that
VerbNet comes with short descriptions of seman-
tic roles and a corpus of illustrative examples, and
that Sowa?s classification could be (and was for
this experiment) formalised as a decision tree. For
VerbNet roles, Fleiss?s ? (called Fleiss?s Multi-
pi in Artstein and Poesio 2008, as it is actually
a generalisation of Scott?s pi rather than Cohen?s
?) is equal to 0.617, and for Sowa?s system it
is a little higher, 0.648. According to the com-
mon wisdom (reflected in Wikipedia?s entry for
?Fleiss? kappa?), values between 0.41 and 0.60 re-
flect moderate agreement and between 0.61 and
0.80 ? substantial agreement. Hence, the current
results could be interpreted as moderately sub-
stantial agreement. However, Artstein and Poesio
2008, p. 591, question this received wisdom and
state that ?only values above 0.8 ensured an anno-
tation of reasonable quality?.
This opinion is confirmed by the more detailed
analysis of the distribution of (dis)agreement pro-
vided in Tab. 1. The top table gives the number
of arguments for which the most commonly as-
signed Sowa?s role was assigned by n annotators
(n ranges from 2 to 7; not from 1, as there were no
arguments that would be assigned 7 different roles
by the 7 annotators) and the most commonly as-
signed VerbNet role was assigned bym annotators
(m also ranges from 2 to 7). For example, the cell
in the row labelled 7 and in the column labelled

Table 1: Interannotator agreement rate for VerbNet and Sowa role systems; the top table gives numbers
of arguments, the bottom table gives normalised percentages
6 contains the information that 52 arguments were
such that all annotators agreed on Sowa?s role and
6 agreed on a VerbNet role. The final row and
the final column contain the usual marginals; e.g.,
out of 843 arguments, in case of Sowa?s system
253 arguments were annotated unanimously, and
in case of VerbNet roles ? 323 arguments. The
lower table gives the same information normalised
to percentages. Note that for a significant percent
of examples (almost 18% in case of Sowa?s sys-
tem and almost 14% in case of VerbNet) there is
no majority decision and that the concentration of
examples around the diagonal means that the lack
of consensus is largely independent of the choice
of the role system.
Some of the most difficult cases were discussed
with annotators and the conclusion reached was
that there are two main reasons for the low IAA:
numerous cases where more than one role seems
to be suitable for a given argument and cases
where there is no suitable role at all. (In fact, as
in case of LECZY
?
C ?treat, cure? discussed below, it
is sometimes difficult to distinguish these two rea-
sons: more than one role seems suitable because
none is clearly right.)
The first situation is caused by the fact that a
distinction between the roles is often highly sub-
jective; for example, when a doctor is treating a
girl, is (s)he causing a structural change? The an-
swer to this question determines the distinction be-
tween Patient and Theme in Sowa?s system. It
could be ?no? when the doctor only prescribes
some medicines, but it could be ?yes? when (s)he
operates her. Furthermore, some emphasis is put
on volitionality in Sowa?s system: the initiatior of
an action can be either Agent or Effector, depend-
ing on whether (s)he causes the action voluntarily
or not ? something that is often difficult to decide
even when a context of a sentence is given.
On the other hand, the Agent role is extended
in VerbNet to ?internally controlled subjects such
as forces and machines?, but it is easy to confuse
this role with Theme. For example, in The horse
jumped over the fence, the horse is ? somewhat
counterintuitively ? marked as Theme, as it must
bear the same role as in Tom jumped the horse over
the fence, where the Agent role is already taken by
Tom. Other commonly confused pairs are Stim-
ulus and Theme, Topic and Theme, and Patient
and Theme. Moreover, there are cases where more
than one role genuinely (not as a result of con-
fusion) matches a given argument. For example,
in the Polish sentence Ona ?aduje sie? w foremke?,
kt?ra? kto?s jej podsuna?? ?She squeezes/loads her-
self into a/the mould that somebody offered her?,
the argument w foremke? ?into mould? can be rea-
83
sonably marked as both: a spatial Destination and
a functional Result.
The other common reason for interannotator
disagreement is the lack of a suitable role. For ex-
ample, returning to the sentence A doctor is treat-
ing a girl, it seems that neither of the two systems
has an obvious role for the person being cured
(hence the impression of potential suitability of a
number of roles). In Polish sentences involving the
verb LECZY
?
C ?treat, cure?, the object of treatment
was variously marked as Agent, Beneficiary, Pa-
tient or Source when using VerbNet roles, and as
Agent, Beneficiary, Experiencer, Patient, Recipi-
ent or Result when using Sowa?s system. Thus,
in Zwierze? jest leczone z tych chor?b ?An animal
is treated for these diseases?, in the VerbNet ex-
periment the animal was marked as Beneficiary
(by 3 annotators), as Patient (?3) and as Source
(?1), and in the Sowa experiment ? as Benefi-
ciary (?2), as Patient (?2), as Recipient (?2) and
as Result (?1). Similarly, for Ma?
?
z leczy? sie? na
serce, lit. ?Husband treated himself for his heart?,
the husband was annotated as Agent (?2), Benefi-
ciary (?2), Patient (?2) and Source (?1) when us-
ing VerbNet roles and as Agent (?1), Beneficiary
(?2), Experiencer (?1), Patient (?2) and Recipi-
ent (?1) when using Sowa?s roles.
Another major problem with the attempt to use
these sets of semantic roles was a high percentage
of verb occurrences with multiple arguments as-
signed the same semantic role. In case of Sowa?s
system 4.36% of sentences had this problem on
the average (the raw numbers for the 7 annotators
are: 2, 5, 8, 9, 17, 31, 34 out of 347 sentences with
no coordination of unlikes in argument positions;
2
note the surprisingly large deviation) and in case
of VerbNet ? 2.47% sentences were so affected (7,
7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12).
On the basis of these experiments, as well as
various remarks in the literature (see, e.g., the ref-
erence to Bobrow et al. 2007b at the beginning
of this section), we conclude that semantic role
systems such as VerbNet or Sowa?s are perhaps
not really well-suited for the grammar engineer-
ing task ? and certainly not worth the time, effort
2
In case of arguments realised as a coordination of un-
likes, e.g., a nominal phrase and a sentential clause, anno-
tators routinely assigned distinct semantic roles to different
conjuncts, so that one argument received a number of differ-
ent roles (from the same annotator) and, consequently, there
were many more duplicates in the remaining 393?347 = 46
sentences than in the 347 sentences free from coordination of
unlikes considered here.
and money needed to construct reasonably-sized
corpora annotated with them ? and that other ap-
proaches must be explored.
3 Syntactic approximation of semantic
roles
In Jaworski and Przepi?rkowski 2014 we propose
to define ?semantic roles? on the basis of mor-
phosyntactic information, including morpholog-
ical cases, following the Slavic linguistic tradi-
tion stemming from the work of Roman Jakob-
son (see, e.g., Jakobson 1971a,b). In particular,
since the broader context of the work reported here
is the development of a syntactico-semantic LFG
(Lexical-Functional Grammar; Bresnan 2001;
Dalrymple 2001) parser for Polish, we build on
the usual LFG approach of obtaining semantic
representations on the basis of f-structures, i.e.,
non-tree-configurational syntactic representations
(as opposed to more surfacy tree-configurational
c-structures) containing information about predi-
cates, grammatical functions and morphosyntac-
tic features; this so-called description-by-analysis
(DBA) approach has been adopted for German
(Frank and Erk, 2004; Frank and Semeck?, 2004;
Frank, 2004), English (Crouch and King, 2006)
and Japanese (Umemoto, 2006).
In the usual DBA approach, semantic roles are
added to the resulting representations on the ba-
sis of semantic dictionaries external to LFG gram-
mars (Frank and Semeck?, 2004; Frank, 2004;
Crouch and King, 2005, 2006). When such
FrameNet- or VerbNet-like dictionaries are not
available, grammatical function names (subject,
object, etc.) are used instead of semantic roles
(Umemoto, 2006). Unfortunately, this latter ap-
proach is detrimental for tasks such as textual en-
tailment, as LFG grammatical functions represent
the surface relations, so, e.g., a passivised (deep)
object bears the grammatical function of (surface)
subject. Other diathesis phenomena also result in
different grammatical functions assigned to argu-
ments standing in the same semantic relation to the
verb, e.g., the recipient of the verb GIVE will nor-
mally be assigned a different grammatical function
depending on whether it is realised as an NP (as in
John gave Mary a book) or as a PP (John gave a
book to Mary).
Although currently no reasonably-sized dictio-
naries of Polish containing semantic role informa-
tion are available, we do not resort to grammatical
84
functions as names of semantic roles, but rather
guess approximations of semantic roles on the ba-
sis of grammatical functions and morphosyntac-
tic features. For example, subjects of active verbs
are marked as R0 (the ?semantic role? approxi-
mating the Agent), but subjects of passsive verbs,
as well as objects of active verbs, are marked as
R1 (roughly, the Undergoer, i.e., Patient, Theme
or Product).
3
Apart from grammatical functions
and the voice value of the verb, also morphosyn-
tactic features of arguments are taken into ac-
count, especially, for PP arguments, the preposi-
tion lemma and the grammatical case it governs.
So, for example, both the OBJ-TH (dative NP) ar-
guments and certain OBL (PP) arguments, e.g.,
those headed by the preposition DLA ?for?, are
translated into the R2 ?semantic role?, which ap-
proximates the Beneficiary and Recipient seman-
tic roles. This results in the same semantic repre-
sentations of Papkin upolowa? dla Klary krokodyla
?Papkin.NOM hunted a crocodile.ACC for Klara?,
lit. ?Papkin hunted for Klara crocodile?, and Pap-
kin upolowa? Klarze krokodyla, lit. ?Papkin.NOM
hunted Klara.DAT crocodile.ACC?.
The advantage of this morphosyntax-based ap-
proach is that it is fully deterministic (only one
?semantic role? may be assigned to a given argu-
ment) and that it ensures high uniqueness of any
?semantic role? in the set of arguments of any verb
(only 6 of the 347 sentences considered above, i.e.,
1.73%, have the same ?semantic role? asigned to a
couple of arguments, compared with 2.47% and
4.36% in the experiments described in this paper;
see Jaworski and Przepi?rkowski 2014 for addi-
tional data). The disadvantage is that sometimes
wrong decisions are made; for example, OBL ar-
guments of type Z[inst] ?with? may have one of
at least three meanings: Perlative (R7), Thematic
(R1) and Co-agentive (R0); in fact, the sentence
Zr?b z nim porza?dek, lit. ?do with him order?, is
ambiguous between the last two and may mean ei-
ther ?Deal with him? (R1) or ?Clean up with him?
(R0). However, the procedure will always assign
only one of these ?roles? to such Z[inst] arguments
(currently R7).
3
We use symbols such as R0 or R1 instead of more mean-
ingful names in order to constantly remind ourselves that we
are dealing with approximations of true semantic roles; this
also explains scare quotes in the term ?semantic role? when
used in this approximative sense.
4 Conclusions
When developing a semantic parser, it makes
sense to aim at neo-Davidsonian representations
with semantic roles relating arguments to events,
as such representations facilitate textual entail-
ment and similar tasks. In this paper we reported
on experiments which show that the practical us-
ability of two popular repertoires of semantic roles
in grammar engineering is limited: as the IAA
is low, systems trained on corpora annotated with
such semantic roles are bound to be inconsistent,
limiting the usefulness of resulting semantic rep-
resentations in such tasks. In case of a language
that does not have a resouce such as VerbNet, the
question arises then whether it makes sense to in-
vest considerable time and effort into creating it.
In this and the accompanying paper Jaworski
and Przepi?rkowski 2014 we suggest an answer in
the negative and propose to approximate seman-
tic roles on the basis of syntactic and morphosyn-
tactic information. Admittedly, this proposal is
currently rather programmatic, as it is supported
only with anectodal evidence. It seems plausible
that the usefulness of resulting representations for
textual entailment should be comparable to ? or
maybe even better than ? that of semantic rep-
resentations produced by semantic role labellers
trained on rather inconsistently annotated data, but
this should be quantified by further experiments.
4
If this hypothesis turns out to be true, however,
the method we propose has the clear advantage of
being overwhelmingly cheaper: instead of many
person-years of building a resource such as Verb-
Net (and then training a role labeller, etc.), a cou-
ple of days of a skilled researcher are required to
define and test reasonable translations from (mor-
pho)syntax to ?semantic roles?.

To the best of our knowledge, no testing data for such
tasks are available for Polish and Polish has never been in-
cluded in evaluation initiatives of this kind. The approach de-
scribed here is currently employed in a large-scale grammar
development effort carried out at the Institute of Computer
Science, Polish Academy of Sciences, in connection with the
CLARIN-PL Research Infrastructure, and we hope to further
report on its usefulness in the future.
