Abstract
We manually created a semantic taxonomy called Phased Predicate Template Taxonomy (PPTT)
that covers 12,023 predicate templates (i.e., predicates with one argument slot like ?rescue X?)
and derived from it various semantic relations between these templates on a million-instance
scale (70%-80% precision level). The derived relations include entailment (e.g., rescue X?X is
alive), happens-before (e.g., buy X?drink X), and a novel relation type anomalous obstruction
(e.g., X is sold out;cannot buy X). Such derivation became possible thanks to PPTT?s design
and the use of statistical methods.
1 Introduction
Databases of various semantic relations between natural language expressions are indispensable knowl-
edge for many NLP applications. For instance, entailment relations are crucial in information extraction
and QA (Dagan et al., 2009; Weisman et al., 2012; Berant et al., 2012; Turney and Mohammad, 2014).
Temporal relations such as happens-before (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004b; Regneri et al., 2010) are im-
portant for enhancing deep semantic processing. A problem, however, is that it is difficult to acquire
those relations with a broad coverage. Although many sophisticated machine learning techniques have
been applied to various kinds of corpora for this task (Szpektor et al., 2007; Chambers and Jurafsky,
2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Hashimoto et al., 2012; Talukdar et al.,
2012; Kloetzer et al., 2013), no satisfactory coverage has been achieved, probably due to data sparseness
in the input data. In this work we take a completely different approach: we manually construct a seman-
tic lexicon called Phased Predicate Template Taxonomy (PPTT), and derive various types of semantic
relations on a large-scale by using it. Our target language is Japanese, but examples are given in English
for simplicity throughout this paper.
PPTT is a taxonomy of predicate templates (predicates with one argument slot like rescue X, ?Tem-
plate? hereafter) that classifies templates according to phases of story concerning an entity denoted by
X. In the story, or the ?life? of the entity X, X can be anticipated, created, then execute its function and
finally it may collapse and become deficient. Anticipation, creation, execution, collapse, deficiency of X
can be seen as such phases of story concerning X, and PPTT classifies templates into 41 semantic classes
each of which corresponds to a phase. In other words, PPTT provides a way to describe the stories of var-
ious entities that constitute this world, and we believe that PPTT (partly) reflects how we understand the
world and its entities. Accordingly, PPTT can also provide a way to derive various semantic knowledge
about this world such as the happens-before relation between events involving an entity, e.g., since the
creation phase usually occurs before the execution phase, invent X (creation phase) is likely to happen-
before use X (execution phase). In addition, entailment relations can be derived: since the creation phase
of an object X must have occurred if X is in its execution phase, it implies that use X is likely to entail
invent X.
In addition, there are ups and downs in stories; some entities suffer setbacks in their stories. PPTT de-
scribes such ?ups and downs? by means of a recently proposed semantic polarity, excitation (Hashimoto

et al., 2012). Excitation classifies templates into excitatory, inhibitory, and neutral; an excitatory tem-
plate like install X and buy X indicates that the main function, effect, purpose or role of the entity referred
to by the X of the template is activated, enhanced, or prepared,
1
while an inhibitory template like unin-
stall X and X is canceled roughly indicates that it is deactivated or suppressed. Neutral templates are
neither excitatory nor inhibitory (e.g., consider X). Roughly speaking, an excitatory template expresses
the events that contribute to turn on the function of X, while an inhibitory template expresses the events
that contribute to turn off or not to turn on the function of X. Then, in PPTT, excitatory and inhibitory
respectively correspond to ?ups? and ?downs? in the story of X. The phases in PPTT are marked accord-
ing to these ups and downs. Accordingly, PPTT can derive many antonymous contradiction pairs like
install X?uninstall X, as Hashimoto et al. did, though we omit the detail for space limitation. Moreover,
PPTT can derive a huge volume of anomalous obstruction, a contradiction-like novel semantic relation
that we propose in this paper, like X is canceled;(cannot) buy X and X is sold out;(cannot) buy X,
which indicate that if X is canceled or sold out, you cannot buy X. Anomalous obstruction should be
used for Why-type QA (Oh et al., 2013), as well as a novel system that warns a user who wants to buy
a commercial product that the product is started to be sold out or canceled in various e-commerce sites
without any application-specific coding.
As suggested, a story has a temporal order between its phases, which we call the canonical temporal
order. In addition, some phases in a story would enable or necessitate another phase in the same story to
occur. In PPTT, these relations are embodied in various temporal-semantic links between phases. Note
that each link between two phases does not guarantee that every possible pair of templates taken from
the two phases has such semantic relations; it just indicates that there exists such tendencies. Despite the
absence of the guarantee, PPTT?s links enable a million-scale derivation of semantic relations with the
help of distributional similarity. In existing resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the links are
assumed to be 100% correct, but it would be hard to have such absolutely correct links in a million-scale.
Hence, we believe that our approximate links are more useful for a large-scale relation derivation.
Note that the goal of our PPTT project is to derive a wide range of semantic relations on a large scale,
rather than to complete a comprehensive template taxonomy. As such, PPTT lacks some templates as
described in later sections. Nevertheless, we believe that our design brings much more good than harm,
since we could generate various semantic relations on a million scale thanks to PPTT. Our experimental
results show that we can derive 4.4 million happens-before relation instances with 79.5% precision,
0.5 million entailment relation instances with 70.0% precision, and one million anomalous obstruction
relation instances with 73.5% precision. Constructing the PPTT taxonomy requires a manual labor cost,
which amounted to three man-months in our case; however, we believe that this cost is lower than the
cost for developing highly-precise automatic acquisition methods for all of happens-before, entailment,
contradiction, and anomalous obstruction relations.
We plan to release PPTT and the derived relation instances after the manual annotation of the derived
instances to the NLP community.
2 Related Works
PPTT might resemble other semantic lexicons created in the long history of NLP (Levin, 1993; Kipper
et al., 2006; Fellbaum, 1998; Bond et al., 2009; Fillmore, 1976; Baker et al., 1998; Halliday, 1985;
Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Puscasu and Mititelu, 2008; Bejar et al., 1991; Jurgens et al., 2012). PPTT
is different in that it primarily aims at deriving various types of semantic relations on a large scale ex-
ploiting the notion of the phase of story, rather than being a comprehensive taxonomy like those existing
semantic lexicons. As a result, PPTT can derive more varieties of semantic relations between templates
than any one of those existing lexicons. From WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998; Bond et al., 2009), we can de-
rive entailment and contradiction relations using synsets and synset-links that represent relations such as
?troponym?, ?antonym? and ?entailment?. However, happens-before and anomalous obstruction relations
1
The above definition is slightly different from the original one in Hashimoto et al. (2012). We inserted the verb ?prepared?
into the original definition. This clarifies that various preparation processes for X, such as buy X, can be regarded as excitatory
templates. We also assume that such templates as X exists and have X, which mean little more than just existence, are regarded
as excitatory templates in PPTT based on the assumption that existence can be regarded as preparation for the function of X.
1424
cannot be derived from it, since there is no information on temporal ordering except that on causality.
From VerbNet (Levin, 1993; Kipper et al., 2006), the hyponymy/synonymy type of entailment relations
may be derived using templates in the same verb classes constructed based on shared syntactic behavior,
possibly with the help of statistical methods. However, the other types of relations that can be derived
from PPTT cannot be derived from VerbNet, since there is no link representing relationships between the
verb classes. FrameNet (Fillmore, 1976; Baker et al., 1998) was used to derive hyponymy/synonymy
types of entailment (Coyne and Rambow, 2009; Aharon et al., 2010) using information such as a Frame-
to-frame relation ?Inheritance? (is-a relation). In addition, happens-before relations can be derived using
?Precedes? (Later-Earlier relations). However, since it does not contain semantic constraints like en-
ablement and necessity that PPTT contains, it is not trivial to derive presupposition type of entailment
or anomalous obstruction instances from it. TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Puscasu and Mititelu,
2008) contains various temporal information and can be used to derive context-dependent happens-before
relations such as the relation between ?leaves? and ?will not hear? in the sentence ?If Graham leaves to-
day, he will not hear Sabine? through TLINK (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) annotated manually; thus, it is
difficult to derive context-independent relations from it, while they can be derived from PPTT. Besides,
since it covers only temporal information, it is difficult to derive other types of relations from it. From
Bejar et al.?s semantic relation taxonomy of lexical pairs (Bejar et al., 1991; Jurgens et al., 2012),
using semantic relation categories such as ?act: act attribute? (e.g., creep:slow), lexical entailment rela-
tions were extracted (Turney and Mohammad, 2014). However, it is not trivial to derive happens-before
or anomalous obstruction relations from it since it does not contain information on temporal sequences
between verbs.
Furthermore, our work differs from automatic methods for extracting temporal or causal relations
(Szpektor et al., 2007; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Talukdar et al.,
2012; Hashimoto et al., 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2014) in that our method does not require that target
pairs co-occur in a document, unlike the previous methods. Hence, our method is likely to be immune
to data sparseness. We could actually derive a wide range of relation instances that were rarely written
in documents because they were too commonsensical (e.g., X is constructed happens-before sew (some-
thing) at X). Needless to say, such commonsensical knowledge is often needed to develop intelligent
systems.
3 PPTT Design
In PPTT, templates are organized hierarchically into three levels. In each level, there are classes that
correspond to phases of stories, which we call Level-0 (L0), Level-1 (L1), and Level-2 (L2) classes.
Each template belongs to only one class at each level. In the following, we describe each level.
3.1 L0-Classes and L0-Links
First we divided the entire story concerning an entity X into five phases: non-existence, existence, func-
tioning, non-existence to existence transition and existence to non-existence transition. Then we created
the five L0-classes listed below, each of which corresponds to one of these five phases.
Non-existence Class The class of templates that do not entail the existence of X, e.g., plan
X.
2
Existence Class The class of templates that entail X?s existence but does not imply the execu-
tion of its main function or the achievement of its objectives, e.g., buy X, X exists.
Functioning Class The class of templates that imply the execution of X?s main function or
the achievement of its objectives, e.g., use X, eat X.
Non-existence to Existence Transition Class (NET Class) The class of templates that ex-
press the transition from a situation in which X does not exist to a situation in which it
exists, e.g., manufacture X.
2
One might think the definition of the Non-existence Class should be ?the templates that DO entail X?s NON-EXISTENCE?.
We did not use such a definition because it would overlook many templates that are consistent with X?s NON-EXISTENCE but
DO NOT entail X?s NON-EXISTENCE, like order X.
1425
Existence to Non-existence Transition Class (ENT Class) The class of templates that ex-
press the transition from a situation in which X exists to a situation in which it does not
exist, e.g., dismantle X.

Figure 1: L0-links among L0-classes.
As mentioned in the introduction, we assume
a canonical temporal order among L0-classes.
For instance, templates in the NET class (e.g.,
manufacture X) should refer to events that usu-
ally happen before those events referred to by
templates in the Existence class (e.g., buy X),
Functioning class (e.g., use X) and ENT class
(e.g., dismantle X). We enumerated such tem-
poral restrictions, each of which is represented
by a link in Figure 1, which we call L0-links
and used them for deriving relations. Note that
we did not set any L0-link between the Exis-
tence class and the Functioning class because
the events described by them may happen in various orders or have temporal overlap. For example, X
exists should have temporal overlap with use X.
Of course, such metaphysical notions as the canonical temporal order and the phases must have many
complications and exceptions. First, many templates that have the neutral excitation polarity (Hashimoto
et al., 2012) did not seem to follow the canonical temporal order among L0-classes. For instance, since
the neutral template think about X does not entail the existence of X, it belongs to the Non-existence
class but one can consider X while X exists or while it is functioning or even after it is collapsed and
violate canonical temporal ordering. For this reason, we excluded neutral templates from PPTT and will
deal with them in a different framework as a future work. In addition, although we did not assume a
temporal order between the Existence class and the Functioning class, some templates in these classes
have a happens-before relation as special cases (e.g., buy X in the Existence class happens before eat
X in the Functioning class). The proposed L0-links also cause problems. For instance, order X (Non-
Existence class) may not always happen before create X (NET class) even though the L0-links indicate
a happens-before relation between their classes. We dealt as far as possible with such cases in level 2
with L2-classes, which are finer than L0-classes. Nonetheless, we stress that the overall plausibility of
the canonical temporal order among L0-classes was experimentally confirmed through the derivation of
happens-before relations only using L0-links. Note that the design of the L0-classes was inspired by the
Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1998) and Aristotle?s Entelecheia (Aristotle, 1987).
3.2 L1-Classes
Excitation
L0-class Excitatory Inhibitory
POTENTIAL class FORECLOSING class
Non-existence class e.g., plan X e.g., prevent X
ENABLING class INCOMMODE class
Existence class e.g., buy X e.g., weaken X
ACTUALIZING class DISORDERING class
Functioning class e.g., X functions e.g., X loses
GENERATING class
NET class e.g., X is born N/A
CORRUPTING class
ENT class N/A e.g., destroy X
Table 1: L1-classes.
Next, we divided some L0-classes into
L1-classes using the excitation polar-
ity (Hashimoto et al., 2012) to intro-
duce ?ups and downs? to PPTT, which
enables to capture semantic inconsis-
tencies between templates (e.g., in-
stall X?uninstall X) and negative in-
teraction between the events referred
to by the templates in PPTT (e.g., X
is canceled;(cannot) hold X). Excita-
tion was originally proposed for recog-
nizing contradictions and causal rela-
tions between templates and then was
successfully applied to other deep se-
mantic processing (Oh et al., 2013; Varga et al., 2013; Kloetzer et al., 2013; Hashimoto et al., 2014).
1426
As shown in Table 1, we divided each of three L0-classes (Non-existence class, Existence class and
Functioning class) into two L1-classes, each of which corresponds to excitatory and inhibitory. Since
the transition to an existence situation can be interpreted as an enhancement of an entity?s function, we
assumed that all the templates in the NET classes are excitatory because they express a transition of
entity X from a non-existence situation to an existence situation. Similarly, we assume all the templates
from the ENT class are inhibitory. Also, L1-classes do not have specific links between them beside the
L0-links from their parent classes.
3.3 L2-Classes and L2-Links
Finally, we divided L1-classes into 41 L2-classes. Specifically, we first roughly grouped together seman-
tically similar templates from the same L1-class and identified the common semantic properties among
them. Note that in the rough grouping, we classified templates so that the resulting groups fit into fine-
grained phases in the story concerning X.
After this initial grouping, we classified all the templates into the L2-classes that are listed in Table
3 alongside the classification criteria and the number of templates in each class. As the classification
criteria, we used the identified common semantic properties among members of each class. Note that
some L2-classes can be regarded as a subset of another L2-class. For instance, the PROHIBIT L2-class
can be seen as a subset of the PREVENTION L2-class. When a template meets the classification criteria
of both a subset class and its superset class, we classified it into the subset class.
We also made links called L2-links between the L2-classes. The motivation behind this is to capture
finer temporal-semantic constraints that could not be specified at Level-0 and Level-1 as well as to
capture the temporal-semantic constraints inside a single L0 or L1-class. For example, the temporal
order between buy X and eat X is encoded in a L2-link between the ACQUISITION and EXECUTION L2-
classes, while there is no L0-link between the Existence L0-class (class of buy X) and the Functioning
L0-class (class of eat X). This exemplifies that the L2- and L0-links complement each other.
Each L2-link has one of the six types of temporal-semantic links that are summarized in Table 2 with
the number of links of each type. The link types were designed to capture how the events referred to by
the templates in a class affect the occurrence or non-occurrence of the events referred to by the templates
in a class in the past, present, or future. C
1
and C
2
being two L2-classes, C
1
?s effect on the occurrence or
non-occurrence of C
2
is represented by Positive (
+
) and Negative (
?
) links, respectively, while C
1
?s effect
on the past, present, or future phase of X expressed by C
2
is represented by Past, Present, and Future
links, respectively. For instance, the Past
+
link from the ABANDONMENT class to the ACQUISITION
class indicates that a template from the ACQUISITION class (e.g., obtain X) must occur before a template
from the ABANDONMENT class (e.g., get rid of X), and the Future
?
link from the PROHIBIT class to
the EXECUTION class indicates that templates from the PROHIBIT class (e.g., ban X) disable templates
from the EXECUTION class (e.g., utilize X). Notice that L2-links represent such semantic constraints as
enablement and necessity in addition to temporal order, and they are useful for deriving various kinds of
semantic relations including entailment and anomalous obstruction, as shown in a later section. The first
author of this paper hand-labeled the links between every combination of L2-class pairs by considering
the name of the classes and a few example templates in each.
Positive Negative
Past If C

e.g.,FORGETTING

Table 3: PPTT classes. The number in parentheses indicates the number of templates in PPTT.
1428
Note that the existence of an L2-link does not guarantee that the semantic properties specified by it
hold for all the possible template pairs taken from the class pair it connects. The cost of hand-labelling
the links with such guarantees is prohibitively high because we would have to check all of the template
combinations. We empirically evaluated the validity of the links in our experiments below although this
is not a direct evaluation since the relations we derived are different from the ones given to the links.
4 Construction of PPTT and Relation Derivation
Using the automatic acquisition method proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012), we collected 10,825 can-
didates of excitatory/inhibitory templates from a 600-million-page web corpus (hereafter, WCorpus).
Hashimoto et al.?s method constructs a network of templates based on their co-occurrence in sentences
with a small number of seed templates of which excitation polarity are assigned manually, and infers the
polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model (Takamura et
al., 2005). Then, we added the 20,000 most frequent templates in the corpus that could not be extracted
automatically for a total of 30,825 templates.
Three human annotators (not the authors) judged the polarity of the templates, and we included the
excitatory and the inhibitory templates but excluded the neutral templates in PPTT due to the reason
discussed in Section 3.1. We also excluded templates whose variable X is the subject of a transitive verb.
This is because the subject position is often occupied by living things, and since the functions/objectives
of such subjects seem difficult to identify, it is often difficult to judge whether such templates should be
classified into the Functioning class or another. After applying these two restrictions, the first author
classified the remaining 12,023 templates in PPTT.
In this work, we derived happens-before, entailment and anomalous obstruction relations among tem-
plates from PPTT. The target data is the set of all the template pairs such that a noun exists with which
both templates of the pair co-occur at least 100 times in WCorpus. We denote this set of the template
pairs by TP100, and all the relation derivations pick up template pairs as relation instances from it. This
is because in our preliminary experiments, we found that the relation instance candidates taken from
outside of TP100 had much lower precision. The relation derivation itself is quite simple and consists
of the following two steps.
Step 1 Select L0-links or types of L2-links that are expected to represent a target semantic
relation (e.g., Present
+
links are expected to represent entailment, since they represent
the relations between classes where ?While C
1
is taking place, C
2
must be taking place?.)
and extract all the class pairs connected by the selected links (e.g., INITIATION L2-class
Present
+
? BEING L2-class). Enumerate all the template pairs from the intersection between
TP100 and the extracted class pairs (e.g., X is started
Present
+
? X exists).
Step 2 If necessary, rank the relation instance candidates that are extracted in Step1 by distri-
butional similarity scores between the templates that compose the candidates, computed
with WCorpus.
5 Experiments
This section reports our experiments on semantic relation derivation. Derived relation instances were
marked by three human annotators (not the authors) who voted to break ties. Unless stated otherwise,
we asked them to mark a template pair as negative if they found any noun that can be placed in both
templates? argument slots and makes the template pair a negative sample for the target relation, and
positive otherwise.
5.1 Happens-Before Relation
Following Regneri et al. (2010), we assumed template
1
(T
1
) has a happens-before relationwith template
2
(T
2
) iff one event expressed by T
1
normally happens before another expressed by T
2
, provided that both
events occur. Below are our four methods to derive happens-before relation instances, each of which
uses different links. Note that we did not use distributional similarity in this experiment.
1429
H1 uses the 55 pairs of L2-classes connected by L2-link Past
+
, meaning that a template in a
class must occur before another.
H2 uses the 90 pairs of L2-classes connected by L2-link Future
+
, i.e., a template in a class
often enables another to occur.
H3 uses the 474 pairs of L2-classes connected by one of the seven L0-links in Figure 1, i.e.,
the canonical temporal order links.
All is the union of H1-H3 results.
We prepared two baselines; HB-Ptn is a pattern-based method based on Chklovski and Pantel (2004a).
It extracts template pairs in TP100 that were connected in WCorpus by one of manually collected 73
conjunctives expressing temporal order, such as after and before, and which either shared the same
argument or the second template was filled by the pronouns it, this, or that. Random is a random
sampling from TP100.
Three annotators annotated 200 random samples from each method?s output. Fleiss? kappa was .56
(moderate agreement). The results of their majority vote are summarized in Table 4. The recall was
estimated against the number of positive samples in TP100 based on the precision of Random. The
precision of all of our four methods is reasonably high for such a difficult task, and the number of
relations derived by All reached about 4.4 million. The recall of All exceeds 65%, which we believe is
quite high. HB-Ptn suffered from low recall, probably due to the data sparseness in WCorpus. Table 5
shows examples of the derived happens-before relations alongside L2-classes of the templates, the L2-
links between the classes and the original Japanese templates. The acquired relations included many
unexpected but correct happens-before relations, like compose (a piece of music) X?relax by X.
Actually, it is difficult to fairly compare our work and previous works on temporal relation acqui-
sition, due to differences in language, the data used, and the methodologies. Nonetheless, our result
with 79.5% precision is at least five times larger than the English data released by Chambers et al.
(cs.stanford.edu/people/nc/schemas), which contains around 870,000 ?before? relation candidates and
happens-before database in the VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004a) that covers 4,205 relations.
Considering our method is completely different from theirs, we believe that our contribution is valuable.

5.2 Entailment Relation
Below are our proposed methods to derive entailment relations.
Present+.DIFF extracts the 32 class pairs that are composed of DIFFERENT L2-classes and
are connected by the Present
+
links, meaning that a template in a class must occur simul-
taneously with another template in another class, and ranks all the possible template pairs
taken from each class pair using Hashimoto et al.?s (2009) conditional probability based
similarity measure for entailment recognition.
Present+.SAME extracts the 41 class pairs that are composed of the SAME L2-classes and
are connected with the Present
+
links, and ranks all the template pairs from each class
pair using Hashimoto et al.?s similarity.
Past+ extracts the 55 pairs of L2-classes that are connected with the Past
+
links, meaning that
a template in a class must occur before another, and ranks all the template pairs from each
class pair using Hashimoto et al.?s similarity.
1430
Baseline-HAS is our baseline which is our implementation of Hashimoto et al. (2009) for entailment
recognition; it ranks all the template pairs in TP100 by Hashimoto et al.?s score. Our methods can be
seen as the restrictions of the output of the baseline method using the extracted PPTT?s class pairs.

Figure 2: Entailment derivation performance.
Three annotators hand-labeled 500
random samples from the top 100,000
template pairs for each method. The
kappa was .59 (moderate agreement),
and the results of their majority vote
are presented in Figure 2. Table 6
shows examples of Proposed methods?
outputs. The restriction of the class
pairs in our method contributed to much
higher precision than using the state-of-
the-art method alone.
Since the precision of Past+ is quite
high for the top 100,000 pairs, we an-
notated an additional 500 random sam-
ples from the top 500,000 pairs. Accord-
ing to this annotation, the top 408,610
pairs had 70% precision, implying that
after merging all the top pairs extracted
by Present+.DIFF, Present+.SAME and Past+ whose precisions exceeded 70%, we had 0.49 million
entailment pairs with 70% precision. With Baseline-HAS, we derived only 24,000 with the same preci-
sion. Also, the JapaneseWordNet (v.1.1) covers only 2.4% of the pairs in the manually annotated positive
samples from our proposed methods through the ?synsets? or any ?synlinks?. We analyzed 200 samples
from the positive samples not covered by WordNet and found that 49.5% are the hyponymy type (e.g.,
boil X?heat X), 39.0% are the backward presupposition type (e.g., complete X?start X), and 11.5% are
the synonymy type (e.g., X passes away?X dies). This seems to imply that our methods are better at
deriving all types of entailment, while WordNet might be effective for only the synonymy type. In addi-
tion, by analyzing all the positive samples, we confirmed that the different types of entailment pairs were
derived with different L2-links; 88.1% of the positive samples from Present+.DIFF and Present+.SAME
require that two events referred to by the two templates occur with temporal overlap (e.g., equip X?X
exists, i.e. X is equipped while X exists), while 96.7% of those from Past+ were the backward presuppo-
sition type, in which an event entails another event that happened before it. This shows that the L2-links
were useful for deriving various fine-grained types of entailment.

5.3 Anomalous Obstruction Relation
We assumed that template
1
(T
1
) like X is sold out has an anomalous obstruction relation with template
2
(T
2
) like buy X (denoted as X is sold out;(cannot) buy X) iff: (A) the event expressed by T
1
prevents
the event expressed by T
2
from occurring; (B) T
1
expresses an event that should not happen if everything
about the variable X goes as expected; and (C) T
2
expresses another event in which the function of X is
executed, enhanced, or prepared. We derived anomalous obstructions, by generating all of the possible
template pairs from the 88 L2-class pairs connected by Future
?
L2-links. These indicate that the events
expressed by the templates in the first class of a pair disable the events expressed by the templates in the
second class. Also, to confirm that the templates of the first class in a pair express an unexpected event,
1431
we required the disabler class to have the inhibitory polarity and the disabled class to be excitatory.
Otherwise, we would obtain such pairs as INITIATION;PLANNING (e.g., start X;schedule X), which
indeed express the prevention relation (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1995), i.e., ?scheduling X would not
occur after starting X,? which is different from anomalous obstruction.
Three annotators annotated 200 random samples for each method, and the results of their majority
vote are summarized in Table 7, where Random refers to a random baseline using TP100. The recall
was estimated using the number of positive samples provided by Random. The kappa was .60 (moderate
agreement). 73.5% precision, 26.4% recall against the positive samples in TP100, and more than one
million outputs of our proposed method are reasonably high/large results for this difficult task. Table 8
shows examples of Proposed?s outputs. ?(cannot)? was attached to disabled templates for readability.

6 Conclusion
In this work, we manually constructed a Phased Predicate Template Taxonomy (PPTT), which is a net-
work of semantically coherent classes of templates and derived semantic relations including entailment
from it in a million-instance scale. Future work will extend PPTT to cover non-excitatory/non-inhibitory
templates and generate richer structural knowledge similar to full-fledged scripts (Schank and Abelson,
1977) and narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011).

Abstract
In this paper we propose a two-stage method
to acquire contradiction relations between
typed lexico-syntactic patterns such as Xdrug
prevents Ydisease and Ydisease caused by
Xdrug . In the first stage, we train an SVM
classifier to detect contradiction pattern pairs
in a large web archive by exploiting the exci-
tation polarity (Hashimoto et al, 2012) of the
patterns. In the second stage, we enlarge the
first stage classifier?s training data with new
contradiction pairs obtained by combining the
output of the first stage?s classifier and that of
an entailment classifier. We acquired this way
750,000 typed Japanese contradiction pattern
pairs with an estimated precision of 80%. We
plan to release this resource to the NLP com-
munity.
1 Introduction
The ability to detect contradictory information in
text has many practical applications. Among those,
Murakami et al (2009) pointed out that a contra-
diction recognition system can detect conflicts and
anomalies in large bodies of texts and flag them to
help users identify unreliable information. For ex-
ample, many Japanese web pages claim that agari-
cus prevents cancer, where agaricus is a species of
mushroom found in a variety of commercial prod-
ucts. Although this has been accepted by many
Japanese people, by Googling keywords ?agaricus?,
?promotes? and ?cancer?, we can find pages claim-
ing that ?agaricus promotes cancer?, some of which
point to a study authorized by the Japanese Min-
istry of Health, Labour and Welfare1 reporting that
1 http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/bukyoku/iyaku/syoku-
anzen/qa/060213-1.html
a commercial product containing agaricus promoted
cancer. Obviously, the existence of these pages casts
serious doubt on the ability of agaricus to prevent
cancer and encourages readers to dig more about this
subject.
The above example suggests that recognizing
contradictory information can guide users to a true
fact. Likewise, we believe that contradiction recog-
nition is also useful when dealing with non-factual
information that occupy most of our daily lives. For
instance, there is a big controversy recently whether
Japan should join an economic partnership agree-
ment called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), and
quite serious but contradictory claims are plentiful in
the mass media and on the web, e.g., TPP will wipe
out Japan?s agricultural businesses and TPP will
strengthen Japan?s agricultural businesses. Neither
of these are facts; they are predictions that can only
be realized or disputed after the underlying decision-
making is done: joining or refusing the TPP.
Furthermore, after reading documents including
contradictory predictions, one should notice that
each of them is supported by a convincing the-
ory that has no obvious defect, e.g., ?Exports of
Japan?s agricultural products will increase thanks to
the TPP? or ?A large amount of low-price agricul-
tural products will be imported to Japan due to the
TPP?. Even if one of these predictions may just hap-
pen to be true because of unexpected reasons such as
minor fluctuations in the Japanese yen, we must sur-
vey such theories that support contradictory predic-
tions, conduct balanced decision-making, and pre-
pare counter measures for the expected problems af-
ter examining multiple viewpoints. Contradiction
recognition should be useful to select documents to
be surveyed.

Figure 1: Method workflow
We have developed a method for recog-
nizing pairs of contradictory binary patterns
such as ??X promotes Y?, ?X prevents Y?? and
??X will wipe out Y?, ?X will strengthen Y??. To
solve the problem described above, we can easily
develop a system that can find contradictory text
fragments from the web like ?agaricus promotes
cancer? and ?agaricus prevents cancer? from the
discovered contradictory pattern pairs.
Our method is a two-stage procedure with three
supervised classifiers (Fig. 1). In the first stage,
we build a classifier BASE to recognize contradic-
tions between binary patterns, and a classifier ENT
to recognize entailment. In the second stage, we
combine the contradiction pairs recognized by BASE
and the entailment pairs recognized by ENT to ex-
pand BASE?s training data and train a new contra-
diction classifier, EXP. This expansion using en-
tailment is one key idea of this work: we acquired
750,000 contradiction pairs with 80% precision us-
ing the expanded training data, more than doubling
the 285,000 pairs acquired at the same precision
level without expansion. We also demonstrate that
this result is not trivial by showing that our method
outperforms an alternative one based on Integer Lin-
ear Programming inspired by the successful entail-
ment recognition method of Berant et al (2011).
As another technical contribution of this work, we
exploit the recently proposed semantic polarity of
excitation (Hashimoto et al, 2012) to recognize con-
tradictions between binary patterns. Hashimoto et
al. (2012) previously showed that excitation polari-
ties are useful to recognize contradictions between
phrases that consist of a noun and a predicate, such
as ?promote cancer? and ?prevent cancer?. While
it is trivial to extend this framework to contradic-
tions between unary patterns such as ?promote X?
and ?prevent X? by replacing the common nouns
in each pair with a variable, the information rep-
resented in unary patterns is often vague, and it is
unlikely that a contradiction between unary patterns
directly leads to the discovery of unreliable infor-
mation to be flagged or to a meaningful survey of
complex problems. As exemplified by the agaricus
and TPP examples, contradictions between binary
patterns that include two variables such as ?X pro-
motes Y? or ?X will wipe out Y? are more useful
than those between unary patterns. We also show
that it is not trivial to recognize contradictions be-
tween binary patterns using contradictions between
unary patterns.
Most works dealing with contradiction recogni-
tion up till now (Harabagiu et al, 2006; Bobrow
et al, 2007; Kawahara et al, 2008; Kawahara et
al., 2010; Ohki et al, 2011) focus on recognizing
contradictions between full sentences or documents,
not text fragments that match our relatively short
patterns (survey in Section 5). We expect that the
contradictory pattern pairs we acquired can be used
as building blocks in such full-fledged contradiction
recognition for full sentences or documents, simi-
larly to antonym pairs in Harabagiu et al (2006).
Also, we should emphasize that our method
focuses on the most challenging part of contra-
diction recognition according to the classification
of De Marneffe et al (2008). Since we discard
patterns with negations, an evident source of contra-
dictions like ??X causes Y?, ?X does not cause Y??,
most of our output are non-trivial contradic-
tions related to high-level semantic phenomena,
e.g., contradiction pairs related to antonyms
like ??X? Y?????, ?X? Y??????
(??X increases Y?, ?X decreases Y??), lexical contra-
dictions like ??X? Y????, ?Y? X?????
(??X wins against Y?, ?Y wins against X??), or
contradictions due to common-sense knowledge
like ??X? Y???????, ?X? Y??????
(??X reassures Y?, ?X betrays Y??). We believe
acquiring such contradictions in a large scale is a
valuable contribution.
The following is the outline of this paper. Sec-
tion 2 details our target and our proposed method.
Evaluation results are discussed in Section 3. Sec-
694
Figure 2: Detailed data flow
tion 4 details our features set, and Section 5 related
work. Section 6 provides a conclusion.
2 Proposed method
As showed in Figure 1, our method consists of
three supervised classifiers. Classifiers BASE and
EXP recognize contradiction relations between bi-
nary patterns, and ENT recognizes entailment rela-
tions between binary patterns. The contradiction
pairs recognized by BASE and the entailment pairs
recognized by ENT are combined to generate new
contradiction pairs, part of which are then added to
BASE training data to train the EXP classifier. Our
final output is the set of all binary pattern pairs re-
garded as contradictions by EXP. Since the depen-
dencies between these three classifiers, their distinct
sets of training data, and the two data sets to be clas-
sified (we describe those in the two sections below)
is a bit complex, we show a complete description of
the whole process in Figure 2.
The key idea is in the scheme that expands the
training data. Logically speaking, patterns p and r
are contradictory if there exists a pattern q such that
p entails q and q contradicts r. For example, since
?X causes Y? entails ?X promotes Y? and ?X pro-
motes Y? contradicts ?X prevents Y?, then ?X causes
Y? contradicts ?X prevents Y?. Hence, by combin-
ing entailment and contradiction pairs, we can ob-
tain more contradiction pairs.
Following this property of contradiction relations,
we collect a set of pattern pairs {?p, r?} for which
there exists a pattern q such that ENT recognizes that
p entails q and BASE recognizes that q contradicts r.
Then we rank these pairs based on a novel scoring
function called Contradiction Derivation Precision
(CDP) and expand BASE training data by adding to
it the top-ranked pairs according to CDP in order to
train EXP. This ranking scheme selects highly accu-
rate contradiction pairs and prevents errors caused
by BASE and ENT from being propagated to EXP.
In the following, after defining the patterns for
which we acquire contradiction relations, we de-
scribe BASE, EXP, ENT, and our expansion scheme.
2.1 Patterns
In this work, a binary pattern is a word sequence
on the path of dependency relations connecting two
nouns in a syntactic dependency tree, like ?X causes
Y?, and we say a noun pair co-occurs with a pattern
if the two nouns are connected by this pattern in the
dependency tree of a sentence in the corpus.
We focus on typed binary patterns, which place
semantic class restrictions on the noun pairs they
co-occur with, e.g., ?Yorganization is in Xlocation?.
Subscripts organization and location indicate the se-
mantic classes of the X and Y slots. Since typed
patterns can distinguish between multiple senses
of ambiguous patterns, they greatly reduce errors
due to pattern ambiguity (De Saeger et al, 2009;
Schoenmackers et al, 2010; Berant et al, 2011).
We automatically induced semantic classes from our
corpus using the EM-based noun clustering algo-
695
rithm presented in Kazama and Torisawa (2008),
and clustered one million nouns into 500 rela-
tively clean semantic classes, including for example
classes of diseases and of chemical substances.
The binary patterns and their co-occurring noun
pairs were extracted from our corpus of 600 mil-
lion Japanese web pages dependency parsed with
KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). We restricted
our patterns to the most frequent 3.9 million pat-
terns of the form ?X-[case particle] Y-[case parti-
cle] predicate? such as ?X-ga Y-ni aru? (?X is in Y?)
which do not contain any negation, number, symbol
or punctuation character. Based on our observation
that patterns in meaningful contradiction and entail-
ment pairs tend to share many co-occurring noun
pairs, we used as input to our classifiers the set Pall
of 792 million pattern pairs for which both patterns
share three co-occurring noun pairs.
2.2 BASE: First stage Classifier for
Contradiction
Below, we detail BASE: its training data and input
data to be classified, and some experimental results.
Our first stage classifier for contradictions, BASE,
is an SVM that uses commonsensical surface and
lexical resources based features, such as n-grams ex-
tracted from patterns, which will be detailed in Sec-
tion 4. An important point to be stressed here is
that we restricted the pattern pairs to be classified
by BASE by exploiting their excitation polarity, a
semantic orientation proposed by Hashimoto et al
(2012). Excitation characterizes unary patterns as
excitatory, inhibitory, or neutral. Excitatory unary
patterns, such as ?cause X? or ?increase X?, entail
that the function, effect, purpose, or role of their ar-
gument?s referent is activated or enhanced, and in-
hibitory unary patterns, such as ?prevent X? or ?X
disappears?, entail that the function, effect, purpose,
or role of their argument?s referent is deactivated or
suppressed. Neutral unary patterns like ?close to X?
are neither excitatory nor inhibitory.
We exploited excitation to restrict the input of
BASE. Based on the result of Hashimoto et al
(2012) showing that two unary patterns with op-
posite polarity have a higher chance to be a con-
tradiction, we extracted from set Pall the set Popp
of binary pattern pairs that contain unary patterns
with opposite excitation polarities as sub-patterns.
??Y cause X?, ?Y prevent X?? is an example of such
a pair since the unary sub-patterns ?cause X? and
?prevent X? are respectively excitatory and in-
hibitory. We used here 6,470 excitation unary pat-
terns hand-labeled as either excitatory (4,882 pat-
terns) or inhibitory (1,588 patterns). Set Popp con-
tains 8 million pattern pairs with roughly 38% true
contradiction pairs, and is the input to BASE. We
will show in experiments at the end of this section
that this restriction is necessary to obtain good per-
formance for BASE. We also tried to add the excita-
tion polarities in BASE?s feature set and classify Pall,
but the performance was worse.
Training Data Another key feature of BASE is
that it is distantly supervised. We did not use
training samples that are directly manually anno-
tated. Instead we automatically generated training
data from a smaller set of (non-)contradiction unary
pattern pairs. We first prepared a set of roughly
800 unary pattern pairs hand-labeled by three human
annotators as contradictions (238 pairs) and non-
contradictions (558 pairs) using majority vote. The
inter-annotator agreement was 0.78 (Fleiss?kappa).
Inspired by Hashimoto et al (2012), we selected
these unary pattern pairs among pairs with high dis-
tributional similarity, with and without restricting
them to having opposite excitation polarity, such as
to get a fair distribution of contradictions and non-
contradictions.
We then extracted from set Pall all 256,000 pat-
tern pairs containing a contradictory unary pattern
pair, and all 5.2 million pattern pairs containing a
non-contradictory unary pattern pair, which we re-
spectively used as positive and negative training data
(estimated 79% and 73% accuracy from 200 hand-
labeled samples). Table 1 shows some examples.
The optimal composition of training data for
BASE was determined according to preliminary ex-
periments using our development set (1,000 manu-
ally labelled samples. See Section 3.1). We trained
20 different classifiers using from 6,250 to 50,000
positive samples (4 sets) and from 12,500 to 200,000
negative samples (5 sets), doubling the amounts in
each step, for a total of 20 configurations. We could
not try a larger training data due to long training time
but we do not expect it to be a problem because the
worst performance was observed with large train-
696
Table 1: Examples of training samples for BASE obtained from unary pattern pairs
Binary pattern pair (the unary pattern pair that extracted it is underlined) Unary pattern pair label

Y ? X ???? (Y too heads toward X) - Y ? X ??? (Y too comes out of X) contradiction
X ?Y ? ??? (add Y to X) - X ?Y ? ??? (insert X into Y) non-contradiction
Y ? X ??? (Y too comes to X) - Y ?? X ??? (go to X with Y) non-contradiction
Figure 3: Effect of the restriction using excitation
ing data (25,000 positives and 200,000 negatives;
the difference from the optimal setting was 2.3% in
average precision). The optimal training data set,
Trainbase, consists of 12,500 positives and 100,000
negatives samples as described above and is the one
we use in our experiments below and in Section 3.
Since BASE input for classification data is Popp
we also tried sampling Trainbase from Popp. We
obtained 56.27% average precision for our classi-
fier BASE, and 52.99% when restricting the source
of training data to pairs in Popp. We believe that the
difference lies in the size of the sets from which we
sampled our training data: while there are 5.46 mil-
lion binary pattern pairs in Pall with a hand-labeled
unary pattern pair in Pall, there are only 237,000
pairs in Popp. We believe this much smaller sam-
ple source lead to a lower performance because it
included much less variations of the patterns.
To train BASE and other classifiers mentioned in
this paper, we used the SVM tool TinySVM2 with
a polynomial kernel of degree 2, the setting which
showed the best performance during our preliminary
experiments.
Effect of Excitation Polarities We also empiri-
cally examined the effect of the restriction on the
patterns using excitation polarities. We used our test
set (2,000 manually annotated samples described in
2 http://chasen.org/?taku/software/TinySVM/
Section 3.1) and 250 manually annotated samples
(majority vote from 3 annotators) from top ranked
pairs of Pall to draw precision curves for BASE over
the top 2 million binary pairs from both Popp and
Pall. In each case we assumed that pairs were dis-
tributed uniformly (i.e., with a constant interval) in
the ranked list of pairs of Popp and Pall, and com-
puted precision accordingly. Since the pairs sets
are reasonably large and were sampled randomly we
thought this was a reasonable hypothesis. The pre-
cision over Popp is higher than that over Pall with
a large margin, suggesting that the restriction using
excitation polarities is beneficial.
2.3 ENT: First stage Classifier for Entailment
ENT is an SVM classifier for entailment trained us-
ing 27,500 hand-annotated binary pattern pairs (set
Trainent, 45% of positive entailment pairs) created
for some previous work (Kloetzer et al, 2013). It es-
sentially uses the same feature set as that for BASE
with the addition of several distributional similar-
ity measures (see Section 4 below for more details).
This classifier is given all pairs of Pall as input and
scores each of them. For this study, we considered
the 44.5 million pattern pairs with a positive SVM
score as entailment pairs. Manual annotation of 200
random samples revealed that the precision of these
pairs was 63% and that the top 7.1 million pairs had
80% precision (result interpolated from the top 16%
of the annotated samples).
2.4 Second stage: Training Data Expansion
and Classifier EXP
Below, we show how we combine BASE?s top output
(hereafter C) and ENT?s top output (hereafter E) in
the second stage of our method to expand Trainbase
and train a new classifier, EXP.
The training data expansion process is based on
the following logical constraint: if a pattern p entails
a pattern q and pattern q contradicts a third pattern r,
then p must contradict r. For example, because ?X
697
Table 2: Examples of triplets ?p, q,r? where p entails q, q contradicts r, and hence p contradicts r

output of BASE, E is the top output of ENT (score > 0)

2: Compute the set of expanded pairs C? = {?p, r? |
?q : ?p, q?? E,?q, r?? C}.
3: Rank the pairs in C? using CDP.
4: Add the N top-ranked pairs in C? \ C as new positive
samples to Trainbase.
5: Remove incoherent negative training samples using
negative cleaning.
6: end procedure
causes Y? (pattern p) entails ?X promotes Y? (pattern
q) and the latter contradicts ?X prevents Y? (pattern
r), we conclude that ?X causes Y? (p) contradicts
?X prevents Y? (r). We call the former contradic-
tion ?q, r? a source contradiction pair, and the later
pair ?p, r? an expanded contradiction pair. Based on
this idea, we combine C and E to aggressively ex-
pand Trainbase. This process is described in Al-
gorithm 1, and Table 2 shows examples of triples
?p, q,r? obtained in our experiments.
Expanding pairs fromC andE compounds the er-
rors made by BASE and ENT, hence it is crucial to
select a highly precise subset of the expanded pairs.
Taking the top pairs according to their SVM score
would achieve this, but since BASE already handles
correctly such pairs, they should not help much as
new training data. We therefore propose a new scor-
ing function for selecting highly precise expanded
pairs: Contradiction Derivation Precision (CDP ).
CDP was designed according to the following
assumption: a source contradiction pair that derives
correct expanded pairs with a high precision should
be reliable. Probably, all the expanded pairs derived
from such a reliable source pair will be correct and
should be included in the new training data .
In our formulation of CDP , correctness of an ex-
panded pair is judged according to the pair?s SVM
score using BASE. In other words, we regard an
expanded pair that has an SVM score above some
threshold ? as a true contradiction. A source contra-
diction pair that derives true contradiction pairs with
a high precision is regarded as a reliable source con-
tradiction pair. CDP , which is defined over a ex-
panded pairs, is the maximum precision among that
of the source contradiction pairs that derive a given
expanded pair.
We first define CDPsub(q, r) over a source con-
tradiction pair ?q, r? as the ratio of expanded pairs
obtained from ?q, r? whose SVM score is above
threshold ?. This ratio corresponds to the precision
of the expanded pairs derived from the source con-
tradiction pair ?q, r?.
CDPsub(q, r) = |{?p, r? ? Ex(q, r) | Sc(p, r) > ?}|
|Ex(q, r)|
HereEx(q, r) is the set of expanded pairs derived
from a source pair ?q, r?, and Sc is the SVM score
given by BASE. In our experiments, we set ? = 0.46
such that pattern pairs for which BASE gives a score
over ? corresponds to the top 5% of BASE?s output.
CDP (p, r) over an expanded pair is defined as fol-
lows, where Source(p, r) is the set of source con-
tradiction pairs that were derived into the expanded
pair ?p, r?.
CDP (p, r) = max?q,r??Source(p,r)CDPsub(q, r)
We then expand the top 5% contradictions of
BASE?s output (set C) and pattern pairs scored pos-
itively by ENT (set E), rank all expanded pairs not
already in C according to CDP, and add the top N
pairs with the highest CDP values as positives to
Trainbase to train EXP. The value of N shall be
determined empirically in later experiments using
a development set. Note that, since CDP (p, r) is
independent of ?p, r??s SVM score, even pairs that
were assigned a negative score by BASE can become
highly ranked by CDP (second triplet in Table 2)
698
and be added to train EXP, hence we expect EXP to
learn something new from these pairs.
Finally, after the addition of expanded pairs, we
remove incoherent training samples. We propose to
remove from the negative training samples of EXP
any pattern pair that may conflict with the newly
added positives; we call this step negative cleaning.
Intuitively, since the content word pairs in a pattern
pair should present some of the strongest evidence
for determining the patterns (non-)contradiction sta-
tus, we remove any negative sample that shares a
content word pair with one of the added expanded
pairs. The final training data for EXP, set Trainexp,
consists of the following: (1) positive samples from
Trainbase, (2) (positive) expanded pairs, and (3)
negative training samples from Trainbase, cleaned
using negative cleaning. We confirmed in our exper-
iments that negative cleaning was necessary to train
a strong EXP classifier (details omitted for reason of
space).
After training EXP with Trainexp, we classify
Popp with EXP to produce the final output of the
whole method. Note that while this expansion pro-
cess can be re-iterated with EXP?s output, our exper-
iments failed to show any improvement with subse-
quent iterations.
3 Evaluation
This section presents our experimental results. We
describe first how we constructed test and develop-
ment data, and then report comparison results be-
tween our method and others including BASE and an
Integer Linear Programming-based (ILP) method.
3.1 Development and Test Data
We asked three human annotators to label 3,000 bi-
nary pattern pairs randomly sampled from Popp as
contradiction or non-contradiction to be used as de-
velopment (1,000 pairs) and test (2,000 pairs) sets.
We considered a pattern pair as a true contradic-
tion relation if at least two out of the three annota-
tors marked it as positive. The inter-rater agreement
score (Fleiss Kappa) was 0.523, indicating moderate
agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). As a definition
of contradiction, we used the notion of incompati-
bility (i.e., two statements are extremely unlikely to
be simultaneously true) proposed by De Marneffe et
Figure 4: Precision of all the compared methods
al. (2008). We then say binary patterns such as ?X
causes Y? and ?X prevents Y? are contradictory if
the above definition holds for any noun pair that can
instantiate the patterns? variables in the provided se-
mantic class pair.
Because our semantic classes are obtained by au-
tomatic clustering and have no meaningful labels,
we followed Szpektor et al (2007) and provided the
annotators with three random noun pairs that co-
occur with the patterns as a proxy for the class pair.
The annotators marked a given pattern pair as posi-
tive if the contradiction relation between the patterns
held for all three noun pairs presented.
3.2 Experimental Results
Here we show how our proposed method outper-
forms baseline methods. We compare the following
four methods:
? PROPOSED: our proposed method. N , the
number of newly added positive training sam-
ples during the training data expansion pro-
cess, was set to 6,000 according to preliminary
experiments using the development set. We
tried 50 different values of N from 1,000 up to
50,000, adding 1,000 each time, and chose the
N value giving the highest average precision
against our development set (1,000 samples).
? BASE: our first stage classifier.
? PROP-SCORE: same as PROPOSED except for
the use of BASE?s SVM score instead of CDP .
N was set to 30,000 in the same way we set N
for PROPOSED.
? HAS: an adaptation of the contradiction ex-
traction method presented in Hashimoto et al
699
(2012). For a binary pattern pair we first
extracted its unary pattern pair with opposite
polarity (or one at random in case there are
two) and scored it based on our implementa-
tion of Hashimoto et al (2012); the score is
based on the distributional similarity between
unary patterns and an excitation score obtained
using a minimally supervised method based on
the spin model. We then scored the binary pat-
tern pair by the score of this unary pattern pair.
We ranked the pattern pairs of our test set (2,000
random pairs from set Popp) based on the score pro-
duced by each method. For each tested method we
assumed that pairs in the test set were distributed
uniformly like explained in Section 2.2. The pre-
cision curves we obtained are shown in Figure 4.
PROPOSED clearly outperformed BASE and ac-
quired around 750,000 contradiction pattern pairs
with an estimated precision of 80%, out of which
some examples are shown in Table 3. These pairs
cover 26,941 content word pairs and reduce to
272,164 untyped pairs, showing that PROPOSED
does not just acquire a handful of contradictions in
many different class pairs. Also, when matching
these pairs against an antonyms database (extracted
from the dictionary of the morphical analyzer JU-
MAN) we found that only 100,886 of these pattern
pairs contain an antonym pair, which means that
most of the extracted pairs? contradictions are due
to more complex phenomena than simple antonymy.
With the same precision, BASE and PROP-SCORE
acquired only 285,000 pairs (covering 11,794 con-
tent word pairs) and 636,000 pairs respectively. This
implies that our two-stage method can more than
double the number of highly precise contradiction
pairs we acquire as well as increasing their vari-
ety, and that ranking expanded pairs using our scor-
ing function CDP is better than with SVM score,
though even PROP-SCORE performs better than
BASE in our setting. Finally, the poor performance
of HAS suggests that extending the Hashimoto et
al.?s framework to recognition of binary patterns is
not a trivial task.
As to why adding only 6,000 top pairs ranked
by CDP performs better than adding 30,000 pairs
ranked by SVM score, the pattern pairs added in
PROP-SCORE had high SVM scores given by BASE
and as such are already handled nicely by BASE.
Table 3: Examples of pairs acquired by PROPOSED: con-
tradiction (label +) and non-contradiction (label -)

Rank 697,177
Y ? X ?????? - Y ? X ????? ?/??
+ X reassures Y - X betrays Y I/her
Rank: 749,916
Hence, we think the effect of adding a new sam-
ple from PROP-SCORE is smaller than that in PRO-
POSED, because in PROPOSED we add to the train-
ing data pattern pairs with both high and low (possi-
bly negative) SVM scores.
Finally, while the quality of the entailment pairs
plays a very important role in the assumption that
was the base of CDP , these results show that even
a simple rule such as ?Use entailment pairs with
SVM score over 0 to expand contradictions before
ranking them with CDP ? is sufficient to make the
method work. Though it may be possible to design
a more complex CDP formula which takes entail-
ment score into account, we did not explore this di-
rection in this work.
Comparison with an ILP-based method Finally,
we would like to compare our method with an ILP-
based method. The interaction between contradic-
tion and entailment that forms the basis for our ex-
pansion method has a natural interpretation as an op-
timization problem. We thus compared our method
to the following ILP formulation of this interaction
inspired by Berant et al (2011), using our test set:
700

BASE+ILP on a restricted test set (1,306 samples)

tradiction pair (Equation (5)). e(p, q) and c(p, q) are
the score given respectively by ENT and BASE, and
? is a prior defining the weight of a pair as neither
entailment nor contradiction that shall be set before
any experimentation. Equation (2) states the tran-
sitivity relation which is the basis of our expansion
method. Finally, Equation (3) states that a given pat-
tern pair cannot be a contradiction pair and an entail-
ment pair at the same time. Since our patterns are
class-dependent, we solved separate ILP instances
for each semantic class pair.
We drew a precision curve for each of BASE,
PROPOSED and BASE+ILP. To draw the curve for
BASE+ILP, we incrementally raised the sample?s
non-contradiction non-entailment prior ? (more de-
tails in Berant et al (2011)). Because of the com-
putational difficulty of ILP (NP-complete) and the
size of our data, the computation for the ILP-based
method ran out of memory on a 72GB machine for
116 class pairs out of the 1,031 that our test set cov-
ers. For this reason, we only used the 1,306 samples
of the test set covered by the remaining 915 class
pairs. We also measured the performance of BASE
and PROPOSED on the same restricted test set.
Figure 5 shows that under these conditions the
ILP-based method performance resembles BASE
and is worse than PROPOSED on all data points.
PROPOSED performs slightly worse in this setting
compared to when classifying the whole of Popp,
but this only means that its performance is good for
the 116 class pairs we ignored in this experiment.
While this comparison is only made in a restricted
setting, our expansion method still outperforms ILP
and is clearly more scalable. The ILP results could
be improved by adding more constraints (contradic-
tion is symmetric, entailment is transitive), but this
would also make the problem even more intractable
in terms of computational costs.
4 Features
In this section we present the features used in our
classifiers, which are mainly categorized into three:
surface features (i.e., those reflecting the patterns?
content itself), features based on external lexical re-
sources, and distributional similarity based features;
all features are listed in Table 4. ENT uses all the
features while BASE and EXP use all except for the
distributional similarity based ones. The optimality
of the feature sets was confirmed through ablation
tests using the development set (results omitted for
the sake of space).
Since patterns with a contradiction or entailment
relation are often superficially similar, for instance,
in case structure or inflection, we use a number of
surface features based on string similarity measures,
extending the feature sets used by Malakasiotis and
Androutsopoulos (2007) for entailment recognition.
They include bag-of-words features such as n-grams
and similarity scores concerning the bag-of-words
such as their Euclidian distance.
To complement the surface features with knowl-
edge about the content words, we used lexi-
cal databases including such as antonymy, syn-
onymy, entailment, or allography. The presence
of such word pairs is usually a good indicator of
(non-)contradiction or (non-)entailment at the pat-
tern level. More specifically, for any word pair
?wp,wq? taken from a pattern pair ?p, q? we mark
the presence of ?wp,wq? in each of the lexical re-
sources as a binary feature. We used the Japanese
lexical resources distributed by the ALAGIN Fo-
rum3: the verb entailment database (117,000 verb

lographic word database (2.7 million pairs; Alagin
ID A-7). We also used the information concerning
allographic words in the dictionary of the morpho-
logical analyzer JUMAN4.
Distributional similarity values between patterns
are based on the idea that patterns that appear in
similar contexts tend to have similar meanings and
as such are useful to recognize entailment (Lin and
Pantel, 2001). We computed as features several dis-
tributional similarity measures on the sets of each
pattern?s co-occurring noun pairs and their POS
tags, of nouns co-occurring in each variable slot, and
with each of the pattern?s unary sub-patterns.
We also added a few more uncategorizable fea-
tures. See Table 4 for more details.
5 Related Work
A number of previous work dealt with the recogni-
tion of contradictions between sentences. Harabagiu
et al (2006) proposed a contradiction detection
method that focuses on negation, antonymy and
some discourse information. Kawahara et al (2010)
also used negations and antonyms to extract con-
trastive/contradictory statements from the web to
present users with a bird ?s-eye view of statements
about a given topic. Bobrow et al (2007) showed
a method using logical forms with relatively precise
results. Ohki et al (2011) proposed a method to rec-
ognize confinment, a novel semantic relation related
to both entailment and contradiction. While we do
not deal ourselves directly with sentences, we expect
that the binary pattern pairs we acquire can play a
role similar to that of basic linguistic resources such
4 http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/index.php?JUMAN
as antonyms and negations in these works. Closer
to our work, Ritter et al (2008) presented a method
for detecting contradictions between functional re-
lations like ?X was born in Y?, but these constitute
only a part of the semantic relations expressed by the
binary patterns we deal with in this paper.
Other works analyzed contradictions from lin-
guistic/semantic viewpoints. Voorhees (2008) ana-
lyzed the contradiction recognition-task of the RTE3
contest. Magnini and Cabrio (2010) examined rela-
tions between contradictions and textual entailment
samples. De Marneffe et al (2008) presented a
typology of contradictions, and showed that con-
tradictions can arise from a multitude of phenom-
ena. They showed contradictions based on lexical or
world knowledge are challenging and require a high-
level understanding of language and/or the world.
As stated in the introduction, these are the types of
contradictions our method focuses on.
6 Conclusion
This paper showed how to acquire a large number of
contradiction pairs between lexico-syntactic binary
patterns by exploiting (1) the interaction between
contradiction and entailment, and (2) excitation po-
larities. In the end, we could acquire 750,000 typed
contradiction pattern pairs with an estimated 80%
precision. The resulting contradiction pairs cov-
ered ones deeply related to world knowledge such
as the pair ??X reassures Y?, ?X betrays Y??. We ex-
pect our work to lead to a high level analysis of
textual information, such as flagging unreliable in-
formation or identifying important documents to be
surveyed for understanding complex social prob-
lems. We plan to release the data we acquired to
the NLP community through the ALAGIN Forum5.

Abstract
We propose a supervised method of
extracting event causalities like conduct
slash-and-burn agriculture?exacerbate
desertification from the web using se-
mantic relation (between nouns), context,
and association features. Experiments
show that our method outperforms base-
lines that are based on state-of-the-art
methods. We also propose methods of
generating future scenarios like conduct
slash-and-burn agriculture?exacerbate
desertification?increase Asian dust (from
China)?asthma gets worse. Experi-
ments show that we can generate 50,000
scenarios with 68% precision. We also
generated a scenario deforestation con-
tinues?global warming worsens?sea
temperatures rise?vibrio parahaemolyti-
cus fouls (water), which is written in no
document in our input web corpus crawled
in 2007. But the vibrio risk due to global
warming was observed in Baker-Austin
et al (2013). Thus, we ?predicted? the
future event sequence in a sense.
1 Introduction
The world can be seen as a network of causal-
ity where people, organizations, and other kinds
of entities causally depend on each other. This
network is so huge and complex that it is almost
impossible for humans to exhaustively predict the
consequences of a given event. Indeed, after the
Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, few ex-
pected that it would lead to an enormous trade
deficit in Japan due to a sharp increase in en-
ergy imports. For effective decision making that
carefully considers any form of future risks and
chances, we need a system that helps humans do
scenario planning (Schwartz, 1991), which is a
decision-making scheme that examines possible
future events and assesses their potential chances
and risks. Our ultimate goal is to develop a system
that supports scenario planning through generat-
ing possible future events using big data, which
would contain what Donald Rumsfeld called ?un-
known unknowns?1 (Torisawa et al, 2010).
To this end, we propose a supervised method
of extracting such event causality as conduct
slash-and-burn agriculture?exacerbate desertifi-
cation and use its output to generate future sce-
narios (scenarios), which are chains of causal-
ity that have been or might be observed in
this world like conduct slash-and-burn agricul-
ture?exacerbate desertification?increase Asian
dust (from China)?asthma gets worse. Note that,
in this paper, A?B denotes that A causes B, which
means that ?if A happens, the probability of B in-
creases.? Our notion of causality should be inter-
preted probabilistically rather than logically.
Our method extracts event causality based on
three assumptions that are embodied as features
of our classifier. First, we assume that two nouns
(e.g. slash-and-burn agriculture and desertifica-
tion) that take some specific binary semantic rela-
tions (e.g. A CAUSES B) tend to constitute event
causality if combined with two predicates (e.g.
conduct and exacerbate). Note that semantic re-
lations are not restricted to those directly relevant
to causality like A CAUSES B but can be those that
might seem irrelevant to causality like A IS AN
INGREDIENT FOR B (e.g. plutonium and atomic
bomb as in plutonium is stolen?atomic bomb is
made). Our underlying intuition is the observation
that event causality tends to hold between two en-
tities linked by semantic relations which roughly
entail that one entity strongly affects the other.
Such semantic relations can be expressed by (oth-
erwise unintuitive) patterns like A IS AN INGRE-
DIENT FOR B. As such, semantic relations like the
MATERIAL relation can also be useful. (See Sec-
1http://youtu.be/GiPe1OiKQuk
987
tion 3.2.1 for a more intuitive explanation.)
Our second assumption is that there are gram-
matical contexts in which event causality is more
likely to appear. We implement what we con-
sider likely contexts for event causality as con-
text features. For example, a likely context of
event causality (underlined) would be: CO2 levels
rose, so climatic anomalies were observed, while
an unlikely context would be: It remains uncertain
whether if the recession is bottomed the declining
birth rate is halted. Useful context information in-
cludes the mood of the sentences (e.g., the uncer-
tainty mood expressed by uncertain above), which
is represented by lexical features (Section 3.2.2).
The last assumption embodied in our associa-
tion features is that each word of the cause phrase
must have a strong association (i.e., PMI, for ex-
ample) with that of the effect phrase as slash-and-
burn agriculture and desertification in the above
example, as in Do et al (2011).
Our method exploits these features on top of our
base features such as nouns and predicates. Exper-
iments using 600 million web pages (Akamine et
al., 2010) show that our method outperforms base-
lines based on state-of-the-art methods (Do et al,
2011; Hashimoto et al, 2012) by more than 19%
of average precision.
We require that event causality be self-
contained, i.e., intelligible as causality without the
sentences from which it was extracted. For ex-
ample, omit toothbrushing?get a cavity is self-
contained, but omit toothbrushing?get a girl-
friend is not since this is not intelligible without a
context: He omitted toothbrushing every day and
got a girlfriend who was a dental assistant of den-
tal clinic he went to for his cavity. This is im-
portant since future scenarios, which are gener-
ated by chaining event causality as described be-
low, must be self-contained, unlike Hashimoto et
al. (2012). To make event causality self-contained,
we wrote guidelines for manually annotating train-
ing/development/test data. Annotators regarded
as event causality only phrase pairs that were
interpretable as event causality without contexts
(i.e., self-contained). From the training data, our
method seemed to successfully learn what self-
contained event causality is.
Our scenario generation method generates sce-
narios by chaining extracted event causality; gen-
erating A?B?C from A?B and B?C. The chal-
lenge is that many acceptable scenarios are over-
looked if we require the joint part of the chain (B
above) to be an exact match. To increase the num-
ber of acceptable scenarios, our method identifies
compatibility w.r.t causality between two phrases
by a recently proposed semantic polarity, exci-
tation (Hashimoto et al, 2012), which properly
relaxes the chaining condition (Section 3.1 de-
scribes it). For example, our method can iden-
tify the compatibility between sea temperatures
are high and sea temperatures rise to chain global
warming worsens?sea temperatures are high
and sea temperatures rise?vibrio parahaemolyti-
cus2 fouls (water). Accordingly, we generated
a scenario deforestation continues?global warm-
ing worsens?sea temperatures rise?vibrio para-
haemolyticus fouls (water), which is written in
no document in our input web corpus that was
crawled in 2007, but the vibrio risk due to global
warming has actually been observed in the Baltic
sea and reported in Baker-Austin et al (2013). In
a sense, we ?predicted? the event sequence re-
ported in 2013 by documents written in 2007. Our
experiments also show that we generated 50,000
scenarios with 68% precision, which include con-
duct terrorist operations?terrorist bombing oc-
curs?cause fatalities and injuries?cause eco-
nomic losses and the above ?slash-and-burn agri-
culture? scenario (Section 5.2). Neither is written
in any document in our input corpus.
In this paper, our target language is Japanese.
However, we believe that our ideas and methods
are applicable to many languages. Examples are
translated into English for ease of explanation.

2 Related Work
For event causality extraction, clues used by
previous methods can roughly be categorized
as lexico-syntactic patterns (Abe et al, 2008;
Radinsky et al, 2012), words in context (Oh et
al., 2013), associations among words (Torisawa,
2006; Riaz and Girju, 2010; Do et al, 2011), and
predicate semantics (Hashimoto et al, 2012). Be-
sides features similar to those described above, we
propose semantic relation features3 that include
those that are not obviously related to causality.
We show that such thorough exploitation of new
and existing features leads to high performance.
2A bacterium in the sea causing food-poisoning.
3Radinsky et al (2012) and Tanaka et al (2012) used se-
mantic relations to generalize acquired causality instances.
988
Other clues include shared arguments (Torisawa,
2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers
and Jurafsky, 2009), which we ignore since we tar-
get event causality about two distinct entities.
To the best of our knowledge, future scenario
generation is a new task, although previous works
have addressed similar tasks (Radinsky et al,
2012; Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013). Neither in-
volves chaining and restricts themselves to only
one event causality step. Besides, the events they
predict must be those for which similar events
have previously been observed, and their method
only applies to news domain.
Some of the scenarios we generated are written
on no page in our input web corpus. Similarly,
Tsuchida et al (2011) generated semantic knowl-
edge like causality that is written in no sentence.
However, their method cannot combine more than
two pieces of knowledge unlike ours, and their tar-
get knowledge consists of nouns, but ours consists
of verb phrases, which are more informative.
Tanaka et al (2013)?s web information analy-
sis system provides a what-happens-if QA service,
which is based on our scenario generation method.
3 Event Causality Extraction Method
This section describes our event causality extrac-
tion method. Section 3.1 describes how to extract
event causality candidates, and Section 3.2 details
our features. Section 3.3 shows how to rank event
causality candidates.
3.1 Event Causality Candidate Extraction
We extract the event causality between two events
represented by two phrases from single sentences
that are dependency parsed.4 We obtained sen-
tences from 600 million web pages. Each phrase
in the event causality must consist of a predicate
with an argument position (template, hereafter)
like conduct X and a noun like slash-and-burn
agriculture that completes X. We also require the
predicate of the cause phrase to syntactically de-
pend on the effect phrase in the sentence from
which the event causality was extracted; we guar-
antee this by verifying the dependencies of the
original sentence. In Japanese, since the tempo-
ral order between events is usually determined by
precedence in a sentence, we require the cause
phrase to precede the effect phrase. For context
4We used a Japanese dependency parser called J.DepP
(Yoshinaga and Kitsuregawa, 2009), available at http://
www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/?ynaga/jdepp/.
feature extraction, the event causality candidates
are accompanied by the original sentences from
which they were extracted.
Excitation We only keep the event causality
candidates each phrase of which consists of exci-
tation templates, which have been shown to be ef-
fective for causality extraction (Hashimoto et al,
2012) and other semantic NLP tasks (Oh et al,
2013; Varga et al, 2013; Kloetzer et al, 2013a).
Excitation is a semantic property of templates that
classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory, and neu-
tral. Excitatory templates such as cause X entail
that the function, effect, purpose or role of their ar-
gument?s referent is activated, enhanced, or man-
ifested, while inhibitory templates such as lower
X entail that it is deactivated or suppressed. Neu-
tral ones like proportional to X belong to neither
of them. We collectively call both excitatory and
inhibitory templates excitation templates. We ac-
quired 43,697 excitation templates by Hashimoto
et al?s method and the manual annotation of exci-
tation template candidates.5 We applied the exci-
tation filter to all 272,025,401 event causality can-
didates from the web and 132,528,706 remained.
After applying additional filters (see Section A
in the supplementary notes) including those based
on a stop-word list and a causal connective list
to remove unlikely event causality candidates that
are not removed by the above filter, we finally ac-
quired 2,451,254 event causality candidates.
3.2 Features for Event Causality Classifier
3.2.1 Semantic Relation Features
We hypothesize that two nouns with some particu-
lar semantic relations are more likely to constitute
event causality. Below we describe the semantic
relations that we believe are likely to constitute
event causality.
CAUSATION is the causal relation between two
entities and is expressed by binary patterns like
A CAUSES B. Deforestation and global warming
might complete the A and B slots. We manually
collected 748 binary patterns for this relation. (See
Section B in the supplementary notes for examples
of our binary patterns.)
MATERIAL is the relation between a material
and a product made of it (e.g. plutonium and
5Hashimoto et al?s method constructs a network of tem-
plates based on their co-occurrence in web sentences with a
small number of polarity-assigned seed templates and infers
the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint
solver based on the spin model (Takamura et al, 2005).

atomic bomb) and can be expressed by A IS MADE
OF B. Its relation to event causality might seem
unclear, but a material can be seen as a ?cause?
of a product. Indeed materials can participate
in event causality with the help of such template
pairs as A is stolen?B is made as in plutonium is
stolen?atomic bomb is made. We manually col-
lected 187 binary patterns for this relation.
NECESSITY?s patterns include A IS NECES-
SARY FOR B, which can be filled with verbal apti-
tude and ability to think. Noun pairs with this rela-
tion can constitute event causality when combined
with template pairs like improve A?cultivate B.
We collected 257 patterns for this relation.
USE is the relation between means (or instru-
ments) and the purpose for using them. A IS USED
FOR B is a pattern of the relation, which can be
filled with e-mailer and exchanges of e-mail mes-
sages. Note that means can be seen as ?causing?
or ?realizing? the purpose of using the means in
this relation, and actually event causality can be
obtained by incorporating noun pairs of this rela-
tion into template pairs like activate A?conduct
B. 2,178 patterns were collected for this relation.
PREVENTION is the relation expressed by pat-
terns like A PREVENTS B, which can be filled with
toothbrushing and periodontal disease. This rela-
tion is, so to speak, ?negative CAUSATION? since
the entity denoted by the noun completing the A
slot makes the entity denoted by the B noun NOT
realized. Such noun pairs mean event causality
by substituting them into template pairs like omit
A?get B. The number of patterns is 490.
The experiments in Section 5.1.1 show that not
only CAUSATION and PREVENTION (?negative
CAUSATION?) but the other relations are also ef-
fective for event causality extraction.
In addition, we invented the EXCITATION rela-
tion that is expressed by binary patterns made of
excitatory and inhibitory templates (Section 3.1).
For instance, we make binary patterns A RISES B
and A LOWERS B from excitatory template rise X
and inhibitory template lower X respectively. The
EXCITATION relation roughly means that A acti-
vates B (excitatory) or suppresses it (inhibitory).
We simply add an additional argument position to
each template in the 43,697 excitation templates to
make binary patterns. We restricted the argument
positions (represented by Japanese postpositions)
of the A slot to either ha (topic marker), ga (nomi-
native), or de (instrumental) and those of the B slot
to either ha, ga, de, wo (accusative), or ni (dative),

occurs with two nouns of an event causality candi-

SR2: Semantic relation types (e.g CAUSATION and EN-
TAILMENT) of the binary pattern of SR1. EXCITA-
TION is divided into six sub types based on the ex-
citation polarity of the binary patterns, the argument
positions, and the existence of causative markers. A
CAUSATION pattern, B BY A, constitutes an indepen-
dent relation called the BY relation.

and obtained 55,881 patterns.
Moreover, for broader coverage, we acquired
binary patterns that entail or are entailed by one
of the patterns of the above six semantic relations.
Those patterns were acquired from our web cor-
pus by Kloetzer et al (2013b)?s method, which ac-
quired 185 million entailment pairs with 80% pre-
cision from our web corpus and was used for con-
tradiction acquisition (Kloetzer et al, 2013a). We
acquired 335,837 patterns by this method. They
are class-dependent patterns, which have seman-
tic class restrictions on arguments. The semantic
classes were obtained from our web corpus based
on Kazama and Torisawa (2008). See De Saeger
et al (2009), De Saeger et al (2011) and Kloet-
zer et al (2013a) for more on our patterns. They
collectively constitute the ENTAILMENT relation.
Table 1 shows our semantic relation features. To
use them, we first make a database that records
which noun pairs co-occur with each binary pat-
tern. Then we check a noun pair (the nouns of the
cause and effect phrases) for each event causality
candidate, and give the candidate all the patterns
in the database that co-occur with the noun pair.
3.2.2 Context Features
We believe that contexts exist where event causal-
ity candidates are more likely to appear, as de-
scribed in Section 1. We developed features that
capture the characteristics of likely contexts for
Japanese event causality (See Section C in the sup-
plementary notes). In a nutshell, they represent a
connective (C1 and C2 in Section C), the distance
between the elements of event causality candidate
(C3 and C4), words in context (C5 to C8), the ex-
istence of adnominal modifier (9 to C10), and the
existence of additional arguments of cause and ef-
fect predicates (C13 to C20), among others.
3.2.3 Association Features
These features measure the association strength
between slash-and-burn agriculture and deser-

between predicates, which is the product of AC5,

132,528,706 event causality candidates in Section
3.1. We omit Do et al?s Dist, which is a constant
since we set our window size to one.

tification in conduct slash-and-burn agricul-
ture?exacerbate desertification for instance and
consist of CEA-, Wikipedia-, definition-, and web-
based features. CEA-based features are based
on the Cause Effect Association (CEA) measure
of Do et al (2011). It consists of association
measures like PMI between arguments (nouns),
between arguments and predicates, and between
predicates (Table 2). Do et al used it (along
with discourse relations) to extract event causality.
Wikipedia-based features are the co-occurrence
counts and the PMI values between cause and ef-
fect nouns calculated using Wikipedia (as of 2013-
Sep-19). We also checked whether an Wikipedia
article whose title is a cause (effect) noun con-
tains its effect (cause) noun, as detailed in Section
D.1 in the supplementary notes. Definition-based
features, as detailed in Section D.2 in the sup-
plementary notes, resemble the Wikipedia-based
features except that the information source is the
definition sentences automatically acquired from
our 600 million web pages using the method of
Hashimoto et al (2011). Web-based features
provide association measures between nouns us-
ing various window sizes in the 600 million web
pages. See Section D.3 for detail. Web-based as-
sociation measures were obtained from the same
database as AC4 in Table 2.
3.2.4 Base Features
Base features represent the basic properties of
event causality like nouns, templates, and their ex-
citation polarities (See Section E in the supple-
mentary notes). For B3 and B4, 500 semantic
classes were obtained from our web corpus using
the method of Kazama and Torisawa (2008).
3.3 Event Causality Scoring
Using the above features, a classifier6 classifies
each event causality candidate into causality and
non-causality. An event causality candidate is
given a causality score CScore, which is the SVM
score (distance from the hyperplane) that is nor-
malized to [0, 1] by the sigmoid function 1
1+e
?x
.
Each event causality candidate may be given mul-
tiple original sentences, since a phrase pair can ap-
pear in multiple sentences, in which case it is given
more than one SVM score. For such candidates,
we give the largest score and keep only one origi-
nal sentence that corresponds to the largest score.7
Original sentences are also used for scenario gen-
eration, as described below.
4 Future Scenario Generation Method
Our future scenario generation method creates
scenarios by chaining event causalities. A naive
approach chains two phrase pairs by exact match-
ing. However, this approach would overlook many
acceptable scenarios as discussed in Section 1. For
example, global warming worsens?sea tempera-
tures are high and sea temperatures rise?vibrio
parahaemolyticus fouls (water) can be chained to
constitute an acceptable scenario, but the joint part
is not the same string. Note that the two phrases
are not simply paraphrases; temperatures may be
rising but remain cold, or they may be decreasing
even though they remain high.
What characterizes two phrases that can be the
joint part of acceptable scenarios? Although we
have no definite answer yet, we name it the causal-
compatibility of two phrases and provide its pre-
liminary characterization based on the excitation
polarity. Remember that excitatory templates like
cause X entail that X?s function or effect is acti-
vated, but inhibitory templates like lower X entail
that it is suppressed (Section 3.1). Two phrases
are causally-compatible if they mention the same
entity (typically described by a noun) that is pred-
icated by the templates of the same excitation po-
larity. Indeed, both X rise and X are high are ex-
citatory and hence sea temperatures are high and
sea temperatures rise are causally-compatible.8
6We used SVMlight with the polynominal kernel (d = 2),
available at http://svmlight.joachims.org.
7Future work will exploit other original sentences, as sug-
gested by an anonymous reviewer.
8Using other knowledge like verb entailment (Hashimoto
et al, 2009) can be helpful too, which is further future work.
991
Scenarios (scs) generated by chaining causally-
compatible phrase pairs are scored by Score(sc),
which embodies our assumption that an acceptable
scenario consists of plausible event causality pairs:
Score(sc) =
?
cs?CAUS(sc)
CScore(cs)
where CAUS(sc) is a set of event causality
pairs that constitutes sc and cs is a member of
CAUS(sc). CScore(cs), which is cs?s score,
was described in Section 3.3.
Our method optionally applies the following
two filters to scenarios for better precision: An
original sentence filter removes a scenario if two
event causality pairs that are chained in it are ex-
tracted from original sentences between which no
word overlap exists other than words constituting
causality pairs. In this case, the two event causal-
ity pairs tend to be about different topics and con-
stitute an incoherent scenario. A common argu-
ment filter removes a scenario if a joint part con-
sists of two templates that share no argument in
our ?argument, template? database, which is com-
piled from the syntactic dependency data between
arguments and templates extracted from our web
corpus. Such a scenario tends to be incoherent too.
5 Experiments
5.1 Event Causality Extraction
Next we describe our experiments on event causal-
ity extraction and show (a) that most of our fea-
tures are effective and (b) that our method outper-
forms the baselines based on state-of-the-art meth-
ods (Do et al, 2011; Hashimoto et al, 2012). Our
method achieved 70% precision at 13% recall; we
can extract about 69,700 event causality pairs with
70% precision, as described below.
For the test data, we randomly sampled 23,650
examples of ?event causality candidate, origi-
nal sentence? among which 3,645 were positive
from 2,451,254 event causality candidates ex-
tracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1). For
the development data, we identically collected
11,711 examples among which 1,898 were posi-
tive. These datasets were annotated by three anno-
tators (not the authors), who annotated the event
causality candidates without looking at the origi-
nal sentences. The final label was determined by
majority vote. The training data were created
by the annotators through our preliminary experi-
ments and consists of 112,110 among which 9,657

were positive. The Kappa (Fleiss, 1971) of their
judgments was 0.67 (substantial agreement (Lan-
dis and Koch, 1977)). These three datasets have
no overlap in terms of phrase pairs. About nine
man-months were required to prepare the data.
Our evaluation is based on average precision;9
we believe that it is important to rank the plausible
event causality candidates higher.
5.1.1 Ablation Tests
We evaluated the features of our method by ab-
lation tests. Table 3 shows the results of remov-
ing the semantic relation, the context, and the as-
sociation features from our method. All the fea-
ture types are effective and contribute to the per-
formance gain that was about 5% higher than the
Base features only. Proposed achieved 70% pre-
cision at 13% recall. We then estimated that, with
the precision rate, we can extract 69,700 event
causality pairs from the 2,451,254 event causality
candidates, among which the estimated number of
positive examples is 377,794.
Next we examined whether the semantic rela-
tions that do not seem directly relevant to causality
like MATERIAL are effective. Table 4 shows that
the performance degraded (46.27 ? 45.86) when
we only used the CAUSATION binary patterns and
their entailing and entailed patterns compared to
Proposed. Even when adding the PREVENTION
(?negative CAUSATION?) patterns and their entail-
ing and entailed patterns, the performance was still
slightly worse than Proposed. The performance
was even worse when using no semantic relation
(?None? in Table 4). Consequently we conclude
that not only semantic relations directly relevant
9It is obtained by computing the precision for each point
in the ranked list where we find a positive sample and aver-
aging all the precision figures (Manning and Schu?tze, 1999).

seem to lack direct relevance to causality like MA-
TERIAL are somewhat effective.
Finally, Table 5 shows the performance drop
by removing the Wikipedia-, definition-, web-,
and CEA-based features. The CEA-based fea-
tures were the most effective, while the Wikipedia-
based ones slightly degraded the performance.
5.1.2 Comparison to Baseline Methods
We compared our method and two baselines based
on Do et al (2011): CEA
uns
is an unsupervised
method that uses CEA to rank event causality can-
didates, and CEA
sup
is a supervised method us-
ing SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is
based on the SVM scores. The baselines are not
complete implementations of Do et al?s method
which uses discourse relations identified based on
Lin et al (2010) and exploits them with CEA
within an ILP framework. Nonetheless, we believe
that this comparison is informative since CEA can
be seen as the main component; they achieved a
F1 of 41.7% for extracting causal event relations,
but with only CEA they still achieved 38.6%.
Table 6 shows the average precision of the com-
pared methods. Proposed is our proposed method.
Proposed-CEA is Proposed without the CEA-
features and shows their contribution. Proposed
is the best and the CEA features slightly contribute
to the performance, as Proposed-CEA indicates.
We observed that CEA
sup
and CEA
uns
performed
poorly and tended to favor event causality candi-
dates whose phrase pairs were highly relevant to
each other but described the contrasts of events
rather than event causality (e.g. build a slow mus-
cle and build a fast muscle) probably because their

main components are PMI values. Figure 1 shows
their precision-recall curves.
Next we compared our method with the base-
lines based on Hashimoto et al (2012). They de-
veloped an automatic excitation template acqui-
sition method that assigns each template an ex-
citation value in range [?1, 1] that is positive if
the template is excitatory and negative if it is in-
hibitory. They ranked event causality candidates

?s templates. The baselines are as fol-
lows: Cs
uns
is an unsupervised method that uses
Cs for ranking, and Cs
sup
is a supervised method
using SVM with Cs as the only feature that uses
SVM scores for ranking. Note that some event
causality candidates were not given excitation val-
ues for their templates, since some templates were
acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto
et al?s method. To favor the baselines for fairness,
the event causality candidates of the development
and test data were restricted to those with excita-
tion values. Since Cs
sup
performed slightly better
when using all of the training data in our prelimi-
nary experiments, we used all of it.
Table 7 shows the average precision of the com-
pared methods. Proposed is our method. Its av-
erage precision is different from that in Table 6
due to the difference in test data described above.

Hashimoto et al (2012) extracted 500,000 event
causalities with about 70% precision. However, as
described in Section 1, our event causality crite-
ria are different; since they regarded phrase pairs
that were not self-contained as event causality
(their annotators checked the original sentences of
phrase pairs to see if they were event causality),
their judgments tended to be more lenient than
ours, which explains the performance difference.
In preliminary experiments, since our proposed
method?s performance degraded when Cs was in-
corporated, we did not use it in our method.
5.2 Future Scenario Generation
To show that our future scenario generation meth-
ods can generate many acceptable scenarios with
reasonable precision, we experimentally com-
pared four methods: Proposed, our scenario
generation method without the two filters, Pro-
posed+Orig, our method with the original sen-
tence filter, Proposed+Orig+Comm, our method
with the original sentence and common argument
filters, and Exact, a method that chains event
causality by exact matching.
Beginning events As the beginning event of a
scenario, we extracted nouns that describe social
problems (social problem nouns, e.g. deforesta-
tion) from Wikipedia to focus our evaluation on
the ability to generate scenarios about them, which
is a realistic use-case of scenario generation. We
extracted 557 social problem nouns and used the
cause phrases of the event causality candidates that

precision (%) in parentheses.
consisted of one of the social problem nouns as the
scenario?s beginning event.
Event causality We applied our event causality
extraction method to 2,451,254 candidates (Sec-
tion 3.1) and culled the top 1,200,000 phrase pairs
from them (See Section F in the supplementary
notes for examples). Some phrase pairs have the
same noun pairs and the same template polar-
ity pairs (e.g. omit toothbrushing?get a cavity
and neglect toothbrushing?have a cavity, where
omit X and neglect X are inhibitory and get X and
have X are excitatory). We removed such phrase
pairs except those with the highest CScore, and
960,561 phrase pairs remained, from which we
generated two- or three-step scenarios that con-
sisted of two or three phrase pairs.
Evaluation samples The numbers of two- and
three-step scenarios generated by Proposed were
217,836 and 5,288,352, while those of Exact were
22,910 and 72,746. We sampled 2,000 from Pro-
posed?s two- and three-step scenarios and 1,000
from those of Exact. We applied the filters to the
sampled scenarios of Proposed, and the results
were regarded as the sample scenarios of Pro-
posed+Orig and Proposed+Orig+Comm. Table
8 shows the number and precision of the samples.
Note that, for the diversity of the sampled scenar-
ios, our sampling proceeded as follows: (i) Ran-
domly sample a beginning event phrase from the
generated scenarios. (ii) Randomly sample an ef-
fect phrase for the beginning event phrase from the
scenarios. (iii) Regarding the effect phrase as a
cause phrase, randomly sample an effect phrase
for it, and repeat (iii) up to the specified number
of steps (2 or 3). The samples were annotated by
three annotators (not the authors), who were in-
structed to regard a sample as acceptable if each
event causality that constitutes it is plausible and
the sample as a whole constitutes a single coherent
story. Final judgment was made by majority vote.
Fleiss? kappa of their judgments was 0.53 (moder-
ate agreement), which is lower than the kappa for
the causality judgment. This is probably because

scenario judgment requires careful consideration
about various possible futures for which individ-
ual annotators tend to draw different conclusions.
Result 1 Table 9 shows the estimated number
of acceptable scenarios generated with 70% pre-
cision. The estimated number is calculated as the
product of the recall at 70% precision and the
number of acceptable scenarios in all the gener-
ated scenarios, which is estimated by the anno-
tated samples. Figures 3 and 4 show the precision-
scenario curves for the two- and three-step sce-
narios, which illustrate how many acceptable sce-
narios can be generated with what precision. The
curve is drawn in the same way as the precision-
recall curve except that the X-axis indicates the
estimated number of acceptable scenarios. At
70% precision, all of the proposed methods out-
performed Exact in the two-step setting, and Pro-
posed+Orig+Comm outperformed Exact in the
three-step setting.
Result 2 To evaluate the top-ranked scenarios
of Proposed+Orig+Comm in the three-step set-
ting with more samples, the annotators labeled 500
samples from the top 50,000 of its output. 341

ber of acceptable scenarios at a precision rate of

the top 50,000 scenarios were acceptable and non-
trivial, i.e., found in no page in our input web cor-
pus, using the 341 acceptable samples. A scenario
was regarded as non-trivial if its nouns co-occur in
no page of the corpus. 22 among the 341 samples
were non-trivial. Accordingly, we estimate that
we can generate 2,200 (50,000?22
500
) acceptable and
non-trivial scenarios from the top 50,000. (See
Section G in the supplementary notes for exam-
ples of the generated scenarios.)

is written in no page in our input web corpus,
which was crawled in 2007.10 But we did find
a paper Baker-Austin et al (2013) that observed
the emerging vibrio risk in the Baltic sea due to
global warming. In a sense, we ?predicted? an
event observed in 2013 from documents written
in 2007, although the scenario was ranked as low
as 240,738th.
6 Conclusion
We proposed a supervised method for event
causality extraction that exploits semantic rela-
tion, context, and association features. We also
proposed methods for our new task, future sce-
nario generation. The methods chain event causal-
ity by causal-compatibility. We generated non-
trivial scenarios with reasonable precision, and
?predicted? future events from web documents.
Increasing their rank is future work.
10The corpus has pages where global warming, sea tem-
peratures, and vibrio parahaemolyticus happen to co-occur.
But they are either diaries where the three words appear sep-
arately in different topics or lists of arbitrary words.
