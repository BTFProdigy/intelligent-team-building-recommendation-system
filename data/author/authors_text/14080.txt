Abstract 
 
This paper deals with the relationship between weblog content and time. With the proposed temporal mutual information, we analyze 
the collocations in time dimension, and the interesting collocations related to special events. The temporal mutual information is 
employed to observe the strength of term-to-term associations over time. An event detection algorithm identifies the collocations that 
may cause an event in a specific timestamp. An event summarization algorithm retrieves a set of collocations which describe an event. 
We compare our approach with the approach without considering the time interval. The experimental results demonstrate that the 
temporal collocations capture the real world semantics and real world events over time.

Introduction 
Compared with traditional media such as online news 
and enterprise websites, weblogs have several unique 
characteristics, e.g., containing abundant life experiences 
and public opinions toward different topics, highly 
sensitive to the events occurring in the real world, and 
associated with the personal information of bloggers. 
Some works have been proposed to leverage these 
characteristics, e.g., the study of the relationship between 
the content and bloggers? profiles (Adamic & Glance, 
2005; Burger & Henderson, 2006; Teng & Chen, 2006), 
and content and real events (Glance, Hurst & Tornkiyo, 
2004; Kim, 2005; Thelwall, 2006; Thompson, 2003). 
In this paper, we will use temporal collocation to 
model the term-to-term association over time.  In the past, 
some useful collocation models (Manning & Sch?tze, 
1999) have been proposed such as mean and variance, 
hypothesis test, mutual information, etc. Some works 
analyze the weblogs from the aspect of time like the 
dynamics of weblogs in time and location (Mei, et al, 
2006), the weblog posting behavior (Doran, Griffith & 
Henderson, 2006; Hurst, 2006), the topic extraction (Oka, 
Abe & Kato, 2006), etc. The impacts of events on social 
media are also discussed, e.g., the change of weblogs after 
London attack (Thelwall, 2006), the relationship between 
the warblog and weblogs (Kim, 2005; Thompson, 2003), 
etc. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines 
temporal collocation to model the strength of term-to-term 
associations over time.  Section 3 introduces an event 
detection algorithm to detect the events in weblogs, and 
an event summarization algorithm to extract the 
description of an event in a specific time with temporal 
collocations. Section 4 shows and discusses the 
experimental results.  Section 5 concludes the remarks. 
Temporal Collocations 
We derive the temporal collocations from Shannon?s 
mutual information (Manning & Sch?tze, 1999) which is 
defined as follows (Definition 1). 
Definition 1 (Mutual Information) The mutual 
information of two terms x and y is defined as: 
)()(
),(log),(),(
yPxP
yxPyxPyxI =  
where P(x,y) is the co-occurrence probability of x and y, 
and P(x) and P(y) denote the occurrence probability of x 
and y, respectively. 
Following the definition of mutual information, we 
derive the temporal mutual information modeling the 
term-to-term association over time, and the definition is 
given as follows.  
 Definition 2 (Temporal Mutual Information) Given 
a timestamp t and a pair of terms x and y, the temporal 
mutual information of x and y in t is defined as: 
)|()|(
)|,(log)|,()|,(
tyPtxP
tyxPtyxPtyxI =
where P(x,y|t) is the probability of co-occurrence of terms 
x and y in timestamp t, P(x|t) and P(y|t) denote the 
probability of occurrences of x and y in timestamp t, 
respectively. 
To measure the change of mutual information in time 
dimension, we define the change of temporal mutual 
information as follows. 
Definition 3 (Change of Temporal Mutual 
Information) Given time interval [t1, t2], the change of 
temporal mutual information is defined as: 
12
12
21
)|,()|,(),,,(
tt
tyxItyxIttyxC ?
?=  
where C(x,y,t1,t2) is the change of temporal mutual 
information of terms x and y in time interval [t1, t2], I(x,y| 
t1) and I(x,y| t2) are the temporal mutual information in 
time t1 and t2, respectively. 
3. Event Detection 
Event detection aims to identify the collocations 
resulting in events and then retrieve the description of 
events. Figure 1 sketches an example of event detection. 
The weblog is parsed into a set of collocations. All 
collocations are processed and monitored to identify the 
plausible events.  Here, a regular event ?Mother?s day? 
and an irregular event ?Typhoon Chanchu? are detected.  
The event ?Typhoon Chanchu? is described by the words  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: An Example of Event Detection
?Typhoon?, ?Chanchu?, ?2k?, ?Eye?, ?Path? and 
?chinaphillippine?.  
The architecture of an event detection system includes 
a preprocessing phase for parsing the weblogs and 
retrieving the collocations; an event detection phase 
detecting the unusual peak of the change of temporal 
mutual information and identifying the set of collocations 
which may result in an event in a specific time duration; 
and an event summarization phase extracting the 
collocations related to the seed collocations found in a 
specific time duration. 
The most important part in the preprocessing phase is 
collocation extraction. We retrieve the collocations from 
the sentences in blog posts. The candidates are two terms 
within a window size. Due to the size of candidates, we 
have to identify the set of tracking terms for further 
analysis. In this paper, those candidates containing 
stopwords or with low change of temporal mutual 
information are removed. 
In the event detection phase, we detect events by 
using the peak of temporal mutual information in time 
dimension.  However, the regular pattern of temporal 
mutual information may cause problems to our detection. 
Therefore, we remove the regular pattern by seasonal 
index, and then detect the plausible events by measuring 
the unusual peak of temporal mutual information. 
If a topic is suddenly discussed, the relationship 
between the related terms will become higher. Two 
alternatives including change of temporal mutual 
information and relative change of temporal mutual 
information are employed to detect unusual events. Given 
timestamps t1 and t2 with temporal mutual information 
MI1 and MI2, the change of temporal mutual information 
is calculated by (MI2-MI1). The relative change of 
temporal mutual information is calculated by (MI2-
MI1)/MI1. 
For each plausible event, there is a seed collocation, 
e.g., ?Typhoon Chanchu?. In the event description 
retrieval phase, we try to select the collocations with the 
highest mutual information with the word w in a seed 
collocation. They will form a collocation network for the 
event.  Initially, the seed collocation is placed into the 
network.  When a new collocation is added, we compute 
the mutual information of the multiword collocations by 
the following formula, where n is the number of 
collocations in the network up to now. 
?= n iMInInformatioMutualMultiwo  
If the multiword mutual information is lower than a 
threshold, the algorithm stops and returns the words in the 
collocation network as a description of the event.  Figure 
2 sketches an example.  The collocations ?Chanchu?s 
path?, ?Typhoon eye?, and ?Chanchu affects? are added 
into the network in sequence based on their MI. 
We have two alternatives to add the collocations to 
the event description. The first method adds the 
collocations which have the highest mutual information 
as discussed above. In contrast, the second method adds 
the collocations which have the highest product of mutual 
information and change of temporal mutual information.

Experiments and Discussions 
Temporal Mutual Information versus 
Mutual Information 
In the experiments, we adopt the ICWSM weblog data 
set (Teng & Chen, 2007; ICWSM, 2007). This data set 
collected from May 1, 2006 through May 20, 2006 is 
about 20 GB. Without loss of generality, we use the 
English weblog of 2,734,518 articles for analysis. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of time information, we 
made the experiments based on mutual information 
(Definition 1) and temporal mutual information 
(Definition 2). The former called the incremental 
approach measures the mutual information at each time 
point based on all available temporal information at that 
time. The latter called the interval-based approach 
considers the temporal mutual information in different 
time stamps.  Figures 3 and 4 show the comparisons 
between interval-based approach and incremental 
approach, respectively, in the event of Da Vinci Code.   
We find that ?Tom Hanks? has higher change of 
temporal mutual information compared to ?Da Vinci 
Code?. Compared to the incremental approach in Figure 4, 
the interval-based approach can reflect the exact release 
date of ?Da Vinci Code.?

=i 1 4.2. Evaluation of Event Detection 
We consider the events of May 2006 listed in 
wikipedia1 as gold standard. On the one hand, the events 
posted in wikipedia are not always complete, so that we 
adopt recall rate as our evaluation metric.  On the other 
hand, the events specified in wikipedia are not always 
discussed in weblogs.  Thus, we search the contents of 
blog post to verify if the events were touched on in our 
blog corpus. Before evaluation, we remove the events 
listed in wikipedia, but not referenced in the weblogs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Interval-based Approach in Da Vinci Code  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4: Incremental Approach in Da Vinci Code 
gure 5 sketches the idea of evaluation.  The left side 
of t s figure shows the collocations detected by our event 
dete tion system, and the right side shows the events 
liste  in wikipedia.  After matching these two lists, we 
can find that the first three listed events were correctly 
identified by our system.  Only the event ?Nepal Civil 
War? was listed, but not found. Thus, the recall rate is 
75% in this case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Evaluation of Event Detection Phase 
As discussed in Section 3, we adopt change of 
temporal mutual information, and relative change of 
temporal mutual information to detect the peak. In Figure 
6, we compare the two methods to detect the events in 
weblogs. The relative change of temporal mutual 
information achieves better performance than the change 
of temporal mutual information. 
                                                     
1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2006 
Table 1 and Table 2 list the top 20 collocations based 
on these two approaches, respectively. The results of the 
first approach show that some collocations are related to 
the feelings such as ?fell left? and time such as ?Saturday 
night?. In contrast, the results of the second approach 
show more interesting collocations related to the news 
events at that time, such as terrorists ?zacarias 
moussaoui? and ?paramod mahajan.? These two persons 
were killed in May 3. Besides, ?Geena Davis? got the 
golden award in May 3. That explains why the 
collocations detected by relative change of temporal 
mutual information are better than those detected by 
change of temporal mutual information.

Table 2: Top 20 collocations with highest relative change 
of mutual information 
4.3. Evaluation of Event Summarization 
As discussed in Section 3, we have two methods to 
include collocations to the event description. Method 1 
employs the highest mutual information, and Method 2 
utilizes the highest product of mutual information and 
change of temporal mutual information. Figure 7 shows 
the performance of Method 1 and Method 2. We can see 
that the performance of Method 2 is better than that of 
Method 1 in most cases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Overall Performance of Event Summarization 
The results of event summarization by Method 2 are 
shown in Figure 8. Typhoon Chanchu appeared in the 
Pacific Ocean on May 10, 2006, passed through 
Philippine and China and resulted in disasters in these 
areas on May 13 and 18, 2006.  The appearance of the 
typhoon Chanchu cannot be found from the events listed 
in wikipedia on May 10.  However, we can identify the 
appearance of typhoon Chanchu from the description of 
the typhoon appearance such as ?typhoon named? and 
?Typhoon eye.  In addition, the typhoon Chanchu?s path 
can also be inferred from the retrieved collocations such 
as ?Philippine China? and ?near China?. The response of 
bloggers such as ?unexpected typhoon? and ?8 typhoons? 
is also extracted.

5. Concluding Remarks 
This paper introduces temporal mutual information to 
capture term-term association over time in weblogs. The 
extracted collocation with unusual peak which is in terms 
of relative change of temporal mutual information is 
selected to represent an event.  We collect those 
collocations with the highest product of mutual 
information and change of temporal mutual information 
to summarize the specific event.  The experiments on 
ICWSM weblog data set and evaluation with wikipedia 
event lists at the same period as weblogs demonstrate the 
feasibility of the proposed temporal collocation model 
and event detection algorithms. 
Currently, we do not consider user groups and 
locations. This methodology will be extended to model 
the collocations over time and location, and the 
relationship between the user-preferred usage of 
collocations and the profile of users.

Combining Multiple Models for Speech Information Retrieval

Abstract 
In this article we present a method for combining different information retrieval models in order to increase the retrieval performance 
in a Speech Information Retrieval task. The formulas for combining the models are tuned on training data. Then the system is evaluated 
on test data. The task is particularly difficult because the text collection is automatically transcribed spontaneous speech, with many 
recognition errors. Also, the topics are real information needs, difficult to satisfy. Information Retrieval systems are not able to obtain 
good results on this data set, except for the case when manual summaries are included. 
 
1. Introduction  
Conversational speech such as recordings of interviews or 
teleconferences is difficult to search through. The 
transcripts produced with Automatic Speech Recognition 
(ASR) systems tend to contain many recognition errors, 
leading to low Information Retrieval (IR) performance 
(Oard et al, 2007). 
Previous research has explored the idea of combining 
the results of different retrieval strategies; the motivation is 
that each technique will retrieve different sets of relevant 
documents; therefore combining the results could produce 
a better result than any of the individual techniques. We 
propose new data fusion techniques for combining the 
results of different IR models. We applied our data fusion 
techniques to the Mallach collection (Oard et al, 2007) 
used in the Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CLSR) task 
at Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2007. The 
Mallach collection comprises 8104 ?documents? which are 
manually-determined topically-coherent segments taken 
from 272 interviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses 
and rescuers, totalling 589 hours of speech. Figure 1 shows 
the document structure in CLSR test collection, two ASR 
transcripts are available for this data, in this work we use 
the ASRTEXT2004A field provided by IBM research with 
a word error rate of 38%. Additionally, metadata fields for 
each document include: two sets of 20 automatically 
assigned keywords determined using two different kNN 
classifiers (AK1 and AK2), a set of a varying number of 
manually-assigned keywords (MK), and a manual 
3-sentence summary written by an expert in the field.  A set 
of 63 training topics and 33 test topics were generated for 
this task. The topics provided with the collection were 
created in English from actual user requests. Topics were 
structured using the standard TREC format of Title, 
Description and Narrative fields. To enable CL-SR 
experiments the topics were translated into Czech, German, 
French, and Spanish by native speakers; Figure 2 and 3 
show two examples for English and its translation in 
French respectively. Relevance judgments were generated 
using a search-guided procedure and standard pooling 
methods. See (Oard et al, 2004) for full details of the 
collection design.  
We present results on the automatic transcripts for 
English queries and translated queries (cross-language) 
for two combination methods; we also present results 
when manual summaries and manual keywords are 
indexed.

2. System Description  
Our Cross-Language Information Retrieval systems 
were built with off-the-shelf components. For the retrieval 
part, the SMART (Buckley, Salton, &Allan, 1992; Salton 
&Buckley, 1988) IR system and the Terrier (Amati &Van 
Rijsbergen, 2002; Ounis et al, 2005) IR system were 
tested with many different weighting schemes for 
indexing the collection and the queries.  
SMART was originally developed at Cornell 
University in the 1960s. SMART is based on the vector 
space model of information retrieval. We use the standard 
notation: weighting scheme for the documents, followed 
by dot, followed by the weighting scheme for the queries, 
each term-weighting scheme is described as a 
combination of term frequency, collection frequency, and 
length normalization components where the schemes are 
abbreviated according to its components variations (n no 
normalization, c cosine, t idf, l log, etc.) We used nnn.ntn, 
ntn.ntn, lnn.ntn, ann.ntn, ltn.ntn, atn.ntn, ntn.nnn , 
nnc.ntc, ntc.ntc, ntc.nnc, lnc.ntc, anc.ntc, ltc.ntc, atc.ntc 
weighting schemes (Buckley, Salton, &Allan, 1992; 
Salton &Buckley, 1988);  lnn.ntn performs very well in 
CLEF-CLSR 2005 and 2006 (Alzghool &Inkpen, 2007; 
Inkpen, Alzghool, &Islam, 2006); lnn.ntn means that lnn 
was used for documents and ntn for queries according to 
the following formulas:  
0.1)ln(nln += tfweight        (1) 
tn
Ntfweight logntn ?=     (2)      
where tf denotes the term frequency of a term t in the 
document or query, N denotes the number of documents 
in the collection, and nt denotes the number of documents 
in which the term t occurs.  
Terrier was originally developed at the University of 
Glasgow. It is based on Divergence from Randomness 
models (DFR) where IR is seen as a probabilistic process 
(Amati &Van Rijsbergen, 2002; Ounis et al, 2005). We 
experimented with the In_expC2 (Inverse Expected 
Document Frequency model with Bernoulli after-effect 
and normalization) weighting model, one of Terrier?s 
DFR-based document weighting models.  
Using the In_expC2 model, the relevance score of a 
document d for a query q is given by the formula: 
                  (3) ?
?

where c is a parameter, tf is the within-document 
frequency of the term t in the document d, l is the 
document length, and avg_l is the average document 
length in the whole collection. 
We estimated the parameter c of the Terrier's 
normalization 2 formula by running some experiments on 
the training data, to get the best values for c depending on 
the topic fields used. We obtained the following values: 
c=0.75 for queries using the Title only, c=1 for queries 
using the Title and Description fields, and c=1 for queries 
using the Title, Description, and Narrative fields. We select 
the c value that has a best MAP score according to the 
training data. 
For translating the queries from French and Spanish 
into English, several free online machine translation tools 
were used. The idea behind using multiple translations is 
that they might provide more variety of words and 
phrases, therefore improving the retrieval performance. 
Seven online MT systems (Inkpen, Alzghool, &Islam, 
2006) were used for translating from Spanish and from 
French into English. We combined the outputs of the MT 
systems by simply concatenating all the translations. All 
seven translations of a title made the title of the translated 
query; the same was done for the description and narrative 
fields.  
We propose two methods for combining IR models. We 
use the sum of normalized weighted similarity scores of 15 
different IR schemes as shown in the following formulas:

34      (8)                         
where Wr(i) and WMAP(i) are experimentally determined 
weights based on the recall (the number of relevant 
documents retrieved) and precision (MAP score) values for 
each IR scheme computed on the training data. For 
example, suppose that two retrieval runs r1 and r2 give 0.3 
and 0.2 (respectively) as  MAP scores on training data; we 
normalize these scores by dividing them by the maximum 
MAP value: then WMAP(r1) is 1 and WMAP(r2) is 0.66 (then 
we compute the power 3 of these weights, so that one 
weight stays 1 and the other one decreases; we chose power 
3 for MAP score and power 4 for recall, because the MAP 
is more important than the recall). We hope that when we 
multiply the similarity values with the weights and take the 
summation over all the runs, the performance of the 
combined run will improve. NormSimi is the normalized 
similarity for each IR scheme. We did the normalization by 
dividing the similarity by the maximum similarity in the 
run. The normalization is necessary because different 
weighting schemes will generate different range of 
similarity values, so a normalization method should 
applied to each run.  Our method is differed than the work 
done by Fox and Shaw in (1994), and Lee in ( 1995); they 
combined the results by taking the summation of the 
similarity scores without giving any weight to each run. In 
our work we weight each run according to the precision 
and recall on the training data.  
3. Experimental Results 
We applied the data fusion methods described in section 2 
to 14 runs produced by SMART and one run produced by 
Terrier.  Performance results for each single run and fused 
runs are presented in Table 1, in which % change is given 
with respect to the run providing better effectiveness in 
each combination on the training data. The Manual 
English column represents the results when only the 
manual keywords and the manual summaries were used 
for indexing the documents using English topics, the 
Auto-English column represents the results when 
automatic transcripts are indexed from the documents, for 
English topics. For cross-languages experiments the 
results are represented in the columns Auto-French, and 
Auto-Spanish, when using the combined translations 
produced by the seven online MT tools, from French and 
Spanish into English. Since the result of combined 
translation for each language was better than when using 
individual translations from each MT tool on the training 
data (Inkpen, Alzghool, &Islam, 2006), we used only the 
combined translations in our experiments. 
Data fusion helps to improve the performance (MAP 
score) on the test data. The best improvement using data 
fusion (Fusion1) was on the French cross-language 
experiments with 21.7%, which is statistically significant 
while on monolingual the improvement was only 6.5% 
which is not significant. We computed these 
improvements relative to the results of the best 
single-model run, as measured on the training data. This 
supports our claim that data fusion improves the recall by 
bringing some new documents that were not retrieved by 
all the runs. On the training data, the Fusion2 method 
gives better results than Fusion1 for all cases except on 
Manual English, but on the test data Fusion1 is better than 
Fusion2. In general, the data fusion seems to help, 
because the performance on the test data in not always 
good for weighting schemes that obtain good results on 
the training data, but combining models allows the 
best-performing weighting schemes to be taken into 
consideration. 
The retrieval results for the translations from French 
were very close to the monolingual English results, 
especially on the training data, but on the test data the 
difference was significantly worse. For Spanish, the 
difference was significantly worse on the training data, 
but not on the test data.  
Experiments on manual keywords and manual 
summaries available in the test collection showed high 
improvements, the MAP score jumped from 0.0855 to 
0.2761 on the test data. 
4. Conclusion 
We experimented with two different systems: Terrier 
and SMART, with combining the various weighting 
schemes for indexing the document and query terms. We 
proposed two methods to combine different weighting 
scheme from different systems, based on weighted 
summation of normalized similarity measures; the weight 
for each scheme was based on the relative precision and 
recall on the training data. Data fusion helps to improve 
the retrieval significantly for some experiments 
(Auto-French) and for other not significantly (Manual 
English). Our result on automatic transcripts for English 
queries (the required run for the CLSR task at CLEF 
2007), obtained a MAP score of 0.0855. This result was 
significantly better than the other 4 systems that 
participated in the CLSR task at CLEF 2007(Pecina et al, 
2007). 
In future work we plan to investigate more methods of 
data fusion (to apply a normalization scheme scalable to 
unseen data), removing or correcting some of the speech 
recognition errors in the ASR content words, and to use 
speech lattices for indexing.
