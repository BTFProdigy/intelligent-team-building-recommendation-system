Abstract 
This paper proposes a method for extracting 
bilingual text pairs from a comparable cor- 
pus. The basic idea of the method is to ap- 
ply bootstrapping to an existing corpus- 
based cross-language information retrieval 
(CLIR) approach. We conducted prelimi- 
nary tests with English and Japanese bilin- 
gual corpora. The bootstrapping method 
led to much better esults for the task of ex- 
tracting translation pairs compared with a 
corpus-based CLIR method without boot- 
strapping, and the extracted translation pairs 
could be useftfl training data for improving 
results of the corpus-based CLIR method. 
1 Introduction 
A parallel corpus is an important resource for 
corpus-based approaches to CLIR. These 
approaches use parallel corpora as statistical 
training data and then retrieve documents writ- 
ten in a language different from that of the query. 
One disadvantage of these approaches i lack of 
resources. Parallel corpora are not always 
readily available and those that are available 
tend to be relatively small or to cover only a 
small number of subjects. 
A bilingual comparable corpus is a set of texts 
in two different languages from the same do- 
main or on the same topic. Unlike a parallel 
corpus it is composed independently in the re- 
spective language text sets. It can be more 
readily obtained from the Internet or CD-ROM 
resources than parallel corpora. Zanettin 
(1998) introduced several available bilingual 
comparable corpora such as news paper articles 
selected by dates and subject codes, medical 
articles from journals and textbooks, and articles 
for tourists from brochures and guides. Zanet- 
tin (1994) also reported that it is highly likely 
that much relevant information can be found 
across languages in a topic-related bilingual 
comparable corpus. In this paper, we propose a 
method for extracting bilingual text pairs which 
share the same information fiom a bilingual 
colnparable corpus, and show the possibility that 
the resulting bilingual text pairs can be useful 
for corpus-based CLIR approaches when we use 
them as training data instead of a parallel corpus. 
Sheridan (1998) also proposed an approach to 
building lnultilingual test collection from com- 
parable corpora consisting of news articles. 
The idea is to reduce the work of manual rele- 
vance judgements by restricting news articles to 
be examined to a couple of days. Disadvan- 
tages to this approach are that it relies on time- 
sensitive texts, texts obtained by this approach 
are constrained to referencing specific events, 
and nontrivial work by hulnans is still necessm'y. 
On the other hand, our goal is to extract bilin- 
gual text pairs automatically from any kind of 
bilingual comparable corpora. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 
2 introduces the basic idea for extracting 
relevant ext pairs from a bilingual comparable 
corpus. Our method is based on a corpus-based 
CLIR method, so we overview previous corpus- 
based CLIR approaches in Section 3. Section 4 
describes an experimental procedure, the results 
it produced, and an analysis of the results. The 
conclusion is given in Section 5. 
2 The Basic Idea 
As we will describe in Section 3, several CLIR 
approaches that rely on parallel corpora have 
been proposed and lead to successful retrieval 
results. In those approaches, a parallel corpus 
used as training data should be large enough to 
obtain good retrieval results. Although we use 
a CLIR method which relies on a parallel corpus, 
we begin with a very small parallel corpus. We 
retrieve bilingual text pairs from a bilingual 
comparable corpus using the small parallel cor- 
pus as training data. Then we concatenate the 
text pairs to the initial small parallel corpus and 
grow the parallel corpus by iterating the retrieval 
and concatenation processes (Figure 1).

Figure 1: The bootstrapping method 
This kind of bootstrapping method has a 
problem, however: It is highly sensitive to the 
accuracy of the text pairs obtained in the early 
stages of the iterations. In order to solve this 
problem, we concatenate only a small number of 
the most "reliable" text pairs to the initial paral- 
lel corpus in the early stages, then gradually 
increase the number of the text pairs which are 
concatenated to the initial parallel corpus. We 
will describe the details of the method in Section 
4. 
3 Corpus-based CLIR approaches 
3.1 Previous Researches 
As we mentioned in Section 2, we use a CLIR 
method which relies on a parallel corpus in our 
bootstrapping method. One approach to cor- 
pus-based CLIR is to use the Latent Semantic 
Indexing technique proposed by Fumas et al 
(1988) on a parallel corpus to construct a lan- 
guage illdependent representation el'queries and 
documents (Landauer and Lfltman, 1990). 
Another approach that relies on a parallel corpus 
has been suggested by l)unning and l)avis 
(1993). Their method is based on the vector 
space model and involves the linear trausforula- 
tion of the representation f a query. A parallel 
corpus can also be used to enhance existing 
knowledge-based resources. The resources ark 
used to translate the query and then classical IR 
matching techniques are applied to compute the 
similarity between the trauslated query and 
documents (Hull and Grel'enstette, 1996). 
3.2 hfforlnation Mapping for CLIR 
For our bootstrapping method, we adopted a 
CLIR method which is based on the hfforma- 
tion Mapping approach (Masuichi et al, 
1999). Information Mapping is basically a 
wlriant of the vector space model, and is based 
on an approach first proposed by Schtitze 
(1995). The approach is closely related to 
Latent Semantic Indexing, and the dilTerence 
between these two is discussed in Schfitze and 
Pedersen (1997). Note that our bootstrapping 
method does not depend on any particuhu" 
properties o1' the Information Mapping ap- 
proach, so it could employ other corpus-based 
CLIR methods such as Latent Semantic in- 
dexing. 
Information Mapping begins with a large 
word-by-word matrix. A list of n content- 
bearing words and m w)cabulary words corre- 
spond to the columns and the rows of the 
matrix. The most fiequently appearing n 
words in a training corpus are selected as 
content-bearing words and the most frequently 
appearing m words as vocabulary words. 
Each cell of the matrix holds the nmnber of 
total cooccurrences between a content-bearing 
word and a vocabulary word in the training 
corpus. In this way, an n-dimensional vector 
which represents the word's distributional 
behavior is produced t'or each vocabulary 
word. Then the original n-dimensional vec- 
tor space is converted into a condensed, lower- 
dilnensional, real-valued matrix using Singular 
Value l)ecomposition (SVD) (Berry, 1992). 
The lower-dimensional vector space is called 
word space. A document vector and a query 
vector are calculated by summing the vectors 
corresponding to the vocabulary words in the 
document or the query, and the proximity 
between the two vectors is del'ined as the cosi- 
ne of the angle between them. 
To apply this method to CL1R, we regard 
each translation pair in a training parallel 
corpus of language LI and L2 as a single 
COlnpotmd document and create a word-by- 
word matrix and then a word space. The 
word space represents a hmguage independent 
vector space for vocabulary words in both 1,1 
and L2, and therefore query and document 
vectors in both LI and L2 can be calculated 
and compmed in the salne word space. 
4 Experimental tests and Results 
4.1 Tests with complete-pair corpora 
We used an English-Japanese bilingual patent 
text corpus for our experilnental tests. For 
our first test, we prepared I000 English- 
Japanese patent text pairs as a pseudo bilin- 
gual comparable corpus. For each Japanese 
patent text in the corpus, its English transla- 
tion by humans exists j, so this corpus could be 
regarded as an ideal bilingual comparable 
corpus. We also prepared 100 pairs as an 
initial parallel corpus (a training corpus) to 
create an initial word space. All the patents 
The quality of the translations wtrics greatly from 
word-for-word translations to short sunnnaries. 
1067 
in the two corpora were randomly selected 
from the Japanese patents issued in 1991, and 
the two corpora shared no patent. We used 
only the title and abstract exts and removed 
all other information, such as author, patent ID 
and issue date. Table 1 shows an example of 
an English-Japanese pair in the corpora. All 
characters in the English texts are l-byte char- 
acters and all characters, including alphabeti- 
cal and numerical characters, in the Japanese 
texts are 2-byte, so there is no word which is 
shared by both English and Japanese texts. 
We used all words which appeared in a train- 
ing corpus as vocabulary words, and the most 
frequently appearing 3000 English words as 
content-bearing words and then reduced the 
dimension of the vectors from 3000 to 200 by 
SVD.

Table 1 : An example of an English- 
Japanese patent pair 
We began with a word space created from 
the 100 English-Japanese translation pairs (the 
initial parallel corpus). Then using the word 
space, we calculated 1000 English patent 
vectors and 1000 Japanese patent vectors 
which correspond to the patent texts in the 
pseudo comparable corpus. Next we extract- 
ed English-Japanese patent pairs which satis- 
fied the simple condition that the English 
patent vector in the pair has the highest prox- 
imity (the biggest cosine) with the Japanese 
patent vector in the pair among the 1000 Ja- 
panese patent vectors, and vice versa (hereaf- 
ter we call these pairs mutual-proximity pairs). 
Note that mutual-proximity pairs are, of 
course, not always correct translation pairs. 
Then we selected the 10 most "reliable" mu- 
tual-proximity pairs, assuming that the higher 
the proximity between the two vectors of a 
mutual-proximity pair, the more reliable the 
mutual-proximity pair is. Finally we con- 
catenated the 10 mutual-proximity pairs to the 
initial 100 translation pairs. This is the first 
stage of our bootstrapping method. 
In the second stage, we created a new word 
space regarding the 110 English-Japanese 
pairs obtained in the first stage as a training 
corpus. Then we selected the 20 most reli- 
able mutual-proximity pairs and concatenated 
them to the initial 100 patent ranslation pairs. 
At the Nth stage, we selected the N* 10 most 
reliable lnutual-proximity pairs. If the num- 
ber of the nmtual-proximity pairs obtained in 
the stage is less than N*I0, all of the mutual- 
proximity pairs were concatenated to the ini- 
tial 100 patent ranslation pairs. 
We repeated this procedure up to the 100th 
stage. At the 100th stage, we obtained 727 
mutual-proximity pairs and 721 pairs out of 
the 727 pairs were correct translation pairs. 
Therefore the recall of the obtained pairs was 
72.1% (721/1000) and the precision was 
99.2% (721/727) (see the column of Testl and 
the row of the "bootstrapping method" of 
Table 2). On the other hand, we obtained 
341 mutual-proximity pairs and 258 pairs out 
of the 341 pairs were correct ranslation pairs 
in the case of the normal Information Mapping 
method which corresponds to the first stage of 
our bootstrapping method. In this case, the 
recall was 25.8% and the precision was 75.7% 
(see the column of Testl and the row of the 
"normal method" of Table 2).

We prepared 4 more different sets of 1000 
pairs 1'or pseudo comparable corpora and dif- 
ferent sets of 100 pairs for initial parallel 
corpora, and repeated the same test 4 more 
times. Table 2 shows results of the 5 tests of 
the bootstrapping method and the normal 
Information Mapping method. In each case the 
bootstrapping method could drastically im- 
prove both the precision and the recall. 
We also conducted tests to see if the result- 
ing text pairs obtained at the 100th stage in the 
previous tests are useful for the normal In fer  
marion Mapping method. We prepared an- 
other 1000 English-Japanese patent ranslation 
pairs for each of the 5 previous tests as 
evaluation corpora. No same patents were 
shared between any two of all the corpora. 
We extracted mutual-proximity pairs froln the 
new 1000 English-Japanese pair with the nor- 
mal Information Mapping method, using (1) 
the initial parallel corpus in the previous test, 
(2) the initial parallel corpus + the mutual- 
proximity pairs obtained in the previous test, 
(3) the initial parallel corpus + the 1000 Eng- 
lish-Japanese correct translation pairs in the 
pseudo comparable corpus of the previous test, 
as a training corpus respectively. For exam- 
ple, in Test 1, the number of pairs in the 
refining corpus is 100 for (1), 827 with 6 error 
pairs for (2) and 1100 for (3). 
the Introduction, it is highly likely that a real 
bilingual comparable corpus includes bilingual 
pairs which share the same information, but it 
also includes a lot of irrelevant texts. To 
simulate this, we replaced half of the Japanese 
patent exts in the pseudo comparable corpora 
of the previous tests with different Japanese 
patent texts which were randomly selected. 
Therefore the corpus included 500 English- 
Japanese translation pairs, and 500 English 
patents and 500 Japanese patents which were 
totally irrelevant to each other.

pairs obtained by our bootstrapping method is 
useful as a training corpus for the normal 
Information Mapping method.

Figure 4, Table 6 and Table 7 show results in 
the case that we replaced 80% of Japanese pat-

The results of these tests are not as good as 
the results of tests with the ideal pseudo compa- 
rable corpora. Figure 4 and 6 show, however, 
the bootstrapping method iml?roved both the 
precision and recall of the extracted text pairs as 
compared to the normal method. Figure 5 and 
7 also show that the bilingual text pairs obtained 
by the bootstrapping method are still useful as a 
training corpus for the normal method. 
5 Conclusion 
We proposed a lnethod of extracting bilingual 
text pairs from a comparable corpus. The 
method is based on an existing corpus-based 
CLIR method and uses bootstrapping. Alt- 
hough our research is in the preliminary stage of 
development and tested with artificial corpora 
consisting of English and Japanese patent exts, 
the bootstrapping led to nmch better results for 
the task of extracting translation pairs than the 
results produced by a normal CLIR method, and 
the extracted translation pairs could be useful for 
improving the results of the normal CLIR when 
we used them as a training corpus.

Abstract 
This paper presents a new statistical method 
for detecting and tracking changes in word 
meaning, based on Latent Semantic Analysis. 
By comparing the density of semantic vector 
clusters this method allows researchers to 
make statistical inferences on questions such 
as whether the meaning of a word changed 
across time or if a phonetic cluster is asso-
ciated with a specific meaning. Possible appli-
cations of this method are then illustrated in 
tracing the semantic change of ?dog?, ?do?, and 
?deer? in early English and examining and 
comparing phonaesthemes. 
1 Introduction 
The increase in available computing power over 
the last few decades has led to an explosion in 
the application of statistical methods to the anal-
ysis of texts. Researchers have applied these me-
thods to a wide range of tasks, from word-sense 
disambiguation (Levin et al, 2006) to the sum-
marization of texts (Marcu, 2003) and the auto-
matic scoring of student essays (Riedel et al, 
2006). However, some fields of linguistics that 
have traditionally employed corpora as their 
source material, such as historical semantics, 
have yet to benefit from the application of these 
statistical methods.  
In this paper we demonstrate how an existing 
statistical tool (Latent Semantic Analysis) can be 
adapted and used to automate and enhance some 
aspects of research in historical semantics and 
other fields whose focus is on the comparative 
analysis of word meanings within a corpus. Our 
method allows us to assess the semantic variation 
within the set of individual occurrences of a giv-
en word type. This variation is inversely related 
to a property of types that we call density ? intui-
tively, a tendency to occur in highly similar con-
texts. In terms of our LSA-based spatial semantic 
model, we calculate vectors representing the con-
text of each occurrence of a given term, and es-
timate the term?s cohesiveness as the density 
with which these token context vectors are 
?packed? in space. 
2 The method 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a collective 
term for a family of related methods, all of which 
involve building numerical representations of 
words based on occurrence patterns in a training 
corpus. The basic underlying assumption is that 
co-occurrence within the same contexts can be 
used as a stand-in measure of semantic related-
ness (see Firth, 1957; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; 
Hoey, 1991, for early articulations of this idea). 
The success of the method in technical applica-
tions such as information retrieval and its popu-
larity as a research tool in psychology, education, 
linguistics and other disciplines suggest that this 
hypothesis holds up well for the purposes of 
those applications. 
The relevant notion of ?context? varies. The 
first and still widely used implementation of the 
idea, developed in Information Retrieval and 
originally known as Latent Semantic Indexing 
(Deerwester et al, 1990), assembles a term-
document matrix in which each vocabulary item 
(term) is associated with an n-dimensional vector 
recording its distribution over the n documents in 
the corpus. In contrast, the version we applied in 
this work measures co-occurrence in a way that 
is more independent of the characteristics of the 
documents in the training corpus, building in-
104
stead a term-term matrix associating vocabulary 
items with vectors representing their frequency 
of co-occurrence with each of a list of ?content-
bearing? words. This approach originated with 
the ?WordSpace? paradigm developed by 
Sch?tze (1996). The software we used is a ver-
sion of the ?Infomap? package developed at 
Stanford University and freely available (see also 
Takayama et al, 1999). We describe it and the 
steps we took in our experiments in some detail 
below. 
2.1 Word vectors 
The information encoded in the co-occurrence 
matrix, and thus ultimately the similarity meas-
ure depends greatly on the genre and subject 
matter of the training corpus (Takayama et al, 
1999; Kaufmann, 2000). In our case, we used the 
entire available corpus as our training corpus. 
The word types in the training corpus are ranked 
by frequency of occurrence, and the Infomap 
system automatically selects (i) a vocabulary ?  
for which vector representations are to be col-
lected, and (ii) a set ? of 1,000 ?content-bearing? 
words whose occurrence or non-occurrence is 
taken to be indicative of the subject matter of a 
given passage of text. Usually, these choices are 
guided by a stoplist of (mostly closed-class) lexi-
cal items that are to be excluded, but because we 
were interested in tracing changes in the meaning 
of lexical items we reduced this stoplist to a bare 
minimum. To compensate, we increased the 
number of ?content-bearing? words to 2,000. The 
vocabulary ? consisted of the 40,000 most fre-
quent non-stoplist words. The set ? of content-
bearing words contained the 50th through 2,049th 
most frequent non-stoplist words. This method 
may seem rather blunt, but it has the advantage 
of not requiring any human intervention or ante-
cedently given information about the domain. 
The cells in the resulting matrix of 40,000 
rows and 2,000 columns were filled with co-
occurrence counts recording, for each 
pair  ?, ? ? ? ? ?, the number of times a token 
of ? occurred in the context of a token of ? in 
the corpus.1 The ?context? of a token ??  in our 
                                                 
1 Two details are glossed over here: First, the Infomap sys-
tem weighs this raw count with a ??. ??? measure of the 
column label c, calculated as follows: ??. ??? ? = ?? ? ?
 ??? ? + 1 ? ??? ?? ?    where ?? and ?? are the number 
of occurrences of ? and the number of documents in which 
? occurs, respectively, and ? is the total number of docu-
ments. Second, the number in each cell is replaced with its 
square root, in order to approximate a normal distribution of 
counts and attenuate the potentially distorting influence of 
implementation is the set of tokens in a fixed-
width window from the 15th item preceding ??  
to the 15th item following it (less if a document 
boundary intervenes). The matrix was trans-
formed by Singular Value Decomposition 
(SVD), whose implementation in the Infomap 
system relies on the SVDPACKC package 
(Berry, 1992; Berry et al, 1993). The output was 
a reduced 40,000 ? 100 matrix. Thus each item 
? ? ? is associated with a 100-dimensional 
vector ?   . 
2.2 Context vectors 
Once the vector space is obtained from the 
training corpus, vectors can be calculated for any 
multi-word unit of text (e.g. paragraphs, queries, 
or documents), regardless of whether it occurs in 
the original training corpus or not, as the normal-
ized sum of the vectors associated with the words 
it contains. In this way, for each occurrence of a 
target word type under investigation, we calcu-
lated a context vector from the 15 words preced-
ing and the 15 words following that occurrence. 
Context vectors were first used in Word Sense 
Discrimination by Sch?tze (1998). Similarly to 
that application, we assume that these ?second-
order? vectors encode the aggregate meaning, or 
topic, of the segment they represent, and thus, 
following the reasoning behind LSA, are 
indicative of the meaning with which it is being 
used on that particular occurrence. Consequently, 
for each target word of interest, the context 
vectors associated with its occurrences constitute 
the data points. The analysis is then a matter of 
grouping these data points according to some 
criterion (e.g., the period in which the text was 
written) and conducting an appropriate statistical 
test. In some cases it might also be possible to 
use regression or apply a clustering analysis. 
2.3 Semantic Density Analysis 
Conducting statistical tests comparing groups of 
vectors is not trivial. Fortunately, some questions 
can be answered based on the similarity of vec-
tors within each group rather than the vectors 
themselves. The similarity between two vectors 
?   , ?  is measured as the cosine between them:2 
                                                                          
high base frequencies (cf. Takayama, et al 1998; Widdows, 
2004). 
2 While the cosine measure is the accepted measure of simi-
larity, the cosine function is non-linear and therefore prob-
lematic for many statistical methods. Several transforma-
tions can be used to correct this (e.g., Fisher?s z). In this 
paper we will use the angle, in degrees, between the two 
vectors (i.e., ????1) because it is easily interpretable. 
105
??? ?   , ?  =
?   ? ? 
 ?     ?  
 
 
The average similarity of a group of vectors is 
indicative of its density ? a dense group of highly 
similar vectors will have a high average cosine 
(and a correspondingly low average angle) 
whereas a sparse group of dissimilar vectors will 
have an average cosine that approaches zero (and 
a correspondingly high average angle).3 Thus 
since a word that has a single, highly restricted 
meaning (e.g. ?palindrome?) is likely to occur in 
a very restricted set of contexts, its context vec-
tors are also likely to have a low average angle 
between them, compared to a word that is highly 
polysemous or appears in a large variety of con-
texts (e.g. ?bank?, ?do?). From this observation, it 
follows that it should be possible to compare the 
cohesiveness of groups of vectors in terms of the 
average pairwise similarity of the vectors of 
which they are comprised. Because the number 
of such pairings tends to be prohibitively large 
(e.g., nearly 1,000,000 for a group of 1,000 vec-
tors), it is useful to use only a sub-sample in any 
single analysis. A Monte-Carlo analysis in which 
n pair-wise similarity values are chosen at ran-
dom from each group of vectors is therefore ap-
propriate.4 
However, there is one final complication to 
consider in the analysis. The passage of time in-
fluences not only the meaning of words, but also 
styles and variety of writing. For example, texts 
in the 11th century were much less varied, on av-
erage, than those written in the 15th century.5 
This will influence the calculation of context 
vectors as those depend, in part, on the text they 
are taken from. Because the document as a whole 
is represented by a vector that is the average of 
all of its words, it is possible to predict that, if no 
other factors exist, two contexts are likely to be 
related to one another to the same degree that 
their documents are. Controlling for this effect 
can therefore be achieved by subtracting from 
                                                 
3
 Since the cosine ranges from -1 to +1, it is possible in 
principle to obtain negative average cosines. In practice, 
however, the overwhelming majority of vocabulary items 
have a non-negative cosine with any given target word, 
hence the average cosine usually does not fall below zero. 
4
 It is important to note that the number of independent 
samples in the analysis is determined not by the number of 
similarity values compared but by the number of individual 
vectors used in the analysis. 
5 Tracking changes in the distribution of the document 
vectors in a corpus over time might itself be of interest to 
some researchers but is beyond the scope of the current 
paper. 
the angle between two context vectors the angle 
between the documents in which they appear.  
3 Applications to Research 
3.1 A Diachronic Investigation: Semantic 
Change 
One of the central questions of historical seman-
tics is the following (Traugott, 1999):6 
 
Given the form-meaning pair ? (lexeme) what 
changes did meaning ? undergo? 
 
For example, the form as long as underwent 
the change `equal in length? > `equal in time? > 
`provided that?. Evidence for semantic change 
comes from written records, cognates, and struc-
tural analysis (Bloomfield, 1933).  Traditional 
categories of semantic change include (Traugott, 
2005: 2-4; Campbell, 2004:254-262; Forston, 
2003: 648-650): 
? Broadening (generalization, extension, 
borrowing): A restricted meaning becomes less 
restricted (e.g. Late Old English docga `a (spe-
cific) powerful breed of dog? > dog `any member 
of the species Canis familiaris? 
? Narrowing (specialization, restriction): A 
relatively general meaning becomes more specif-
ic (e.g. Old English deor `animal? > deer) 
? Pejoration (degeneration): A meaning be-
comes more negative (e.g. Old English s?lig 
`blessed, blissful? > sely `happy, innocent, pitia-
ble? > silly `foolish, stupid?) 
 
Semantic change results from the use of lan-
guage in context, whether linguistic or extralin-
guistic. Later meanings of forms are connected to 
earlier ones, where all semantic change arises by 
polysemy, i.e. new meanings coexist with earlier 
ones, typically in restricted contexts. Sometimes 
new meanings split off from earlier ones and are 
no longer considered variants by language users 
(e.g. mistress `woman in a position of authority, 
head of household? > `woman in a continuing 
extra-marital relationship with a man?). 
Semantic change is often considered unsyste-
matic (Hock and Joseph, 1996: 252). However, 
recent work (Traugott and Dasher, 2002) sug-
gests that there is, in fact, significant cross-
linguistic regularity in semantic change. For ex-
                                                 
6 This is the semasiological perspective on semantic change. 
Other perspectives include the onomasiological perspective 
(?Given the concept ?, what lexemes can it be expressed 
by??). See Traugott 1999 for discussion. 
106
ample, in the Invited Inferencing Model of Se-
mantic Change proposed by Traugott and Dasher 
(2002) the main mechanism of semantic change 
is argued to be the semanticization of conversa-
tional implicatures, where conversational impli-
catures are a component of speaker meaning that 
arises from the interaction between what the 
speaker says and rational principles of communi-
cation (Grice, 1989 [1975]). Conversational im-
plicatures are suggested by an utterance but not 
entailed. For example, the utterance Some stu-
dents came to the party strongly suggests that 
some but not all students came to the party, even 
though the utterance would be true strictly speak-
ing if all students came to the party. According to 
the Invited Inferencing Model, conversational 
implicatures become part of the semantic poly-
semies of particular forms over time. 
Such changes in meaning should be evident 
when examining the contexts in which the lex-
eme of interest appears. In other words, changes 
in the meaning of a type should translate to dif-
ferences in the contexts in which its tokens are 
used. For instance, semantic broadening results 
in a meaning that is less restricted and as a result 
can be used in a larger variety of contexts. In a 
semantic space that encompasses the period of 
such a change, this increase in variety can be 
measured as a decrease in vector density across 
the time span of the corpus. This decrease trans-
lates into an increase in the average angle be-
tween the context vectors for the word. For in-
stance, because the Old English word ?docga? 
applied to a specific breed of dog, we predicted 
that earlier occurrences of the lexemes ?docga? 
and ?dog?, in a corpus of documents of the ap-
propriate time period, will show less variety than 
later occurrences. 
An even more extreme case of semantic broa-
dening is predicted to occur as part of the process 
of grammaticalization (Traugot and Dasher, 
2002) in which a content word becomes a func-
tion word. Because, as a general rule, a function 
word can be used in a much larger variety of 
contexts than a content word, a word that under-
went grammaticalization should appear in a sub-
stantially larger variety of contexts than it did 
prior to becoming a function word. One well stu-
died case of grammaticalization is that of periph-
rastic ?do?. While in Old English ?do? was used 
as a verb with a causative and habitual sense 
(e.g. ?do you harm?), later in English it took on a 
functional role that is nearly devoid of meaning 
(e.g. ?do you know him??). Because this change 
occurred in Middle English, we predicted that 
earlier occurrences of ?do? will show less variety 
than later ones. 
In contrast with broadening, semantic narrow-
ing results in a meaning that is more restricted, 
and is therefore applicable in fewer contexts than 
before. This decrease in variety results in an in-
crease in vector density and can be directly 
measured as a decrease in the average angle be-
tween the context vectors for the word. As an 
example, the Old English word ?deor? denoted a 
larger group of living creatures than does the 
Modern English word ?deer?. We therefore pre-
dicted that earlier occurrences of the lexemes 
?deor? and ?deer?, in a corpus of the appropriate 
time period, will show more variety than later 
occurrences. 
We tested our predictions using a corpus de-
rived from the Helsinki corpus (Rissanen, 1994). 
The Helsinki corpus is comprised of texts span-
ning the periods of Old English (prior to 
1150A.D.), Middle English (1150-1500A.D.), 
and Early Modern English (1500-1710A.D.). 
Because spelling in Old English was highly vari-
able, we decided to exclude that part of the cor-
pus and focused our analysis on the Middle Eng-
lish and Early Modern English periods. The re-
sulting corpus included 504 distinct documents 
totaling approximately 1.1 million words. 
To test our predictions regarding semantic 
change in the words ?dog?, ?do?, and ?deer?, we 
collected all of the contexts in which they appear 
in our subset of the Helsinki corpus. This re-
sulted in 112 contexts for ?dog?, 4298 contexts 
for ?do?, and 61 contexts for ?deer?. Because 
there were relatively few occurrences of ?dog?

and ?deer? in the corpus it was practical to com-
pute the angles between all possible pairs of con-
text vectors. As a result, we elected to forgo the 
Monte-Carlo analysis for those two words in fa-
vor of a full analysis. The results of our analysis 
for all three words are given in Table 1. These 
results were congruent with our prediction: The 
density of the contexts decreases over time for 
both ?dog? (t(110) = 2.17, p < .05) and ?do? 
(F(2,2997)=409.41, p < .01) while in the case of 
?deer? there is an increase in the density of the 
contexts over time (t(36) = 3.05, p < .01). 
Furthermore, our analysis corresponds with 
the data collected by Elleg?rd (1953). Elleg?rd 
traced the grammaticalization of ?do? by manual-
ly examining changes in the proportions of its 
various uses between 1400 and 1700. His data 
identifies an overall shift in the pattern of use 
that occurred mainly between 1475 and 1575. 
Our analysis identifies a similar shift in patterns 
between the time periods spanning 1350-1500 
and 1500-1570. Figure 1 depicts an overlay of 
both datasets. The relative scale of the two sets 
was set so that the proportions of ?do? uses at 
1400 and 1700 (the beginning and end of El-
leg?rd?s data, respectively) match the semantic 
density measured by our method at those times. 
Finally, our method can be used not only to 
test predictions based on established cases of 
semantic change, but also to identify new ones. 
For instance, in examining the contexts of the 
word ?science? we can identify that it underwent 
semantic broadening shortly after it first ap-
peared in the 14th century (t(77) = 4.51, p < .01). 
A subsequent examination of the contexts in 
which the word appears indicated that this is 
probably the result of a shift from a meaning re-
lated to generalized knowledge (e.g., ??and 
learn science of school?, John of Trevisa's Polyc-
hronicon, 1387) to one that can also be used to 
refer to more specific disciplines (e.g., ??of the 
seven liberal sciences?, Simon Forman?s Diary, 
1602). 
Our long term goal with respect to this type of 
analysis is to use this method in a computer-
based tool that can scan a diachronic corpus and 
automatically identify probable cases of semantic 
change within it. Researchers can then use these 
results to focus on identifying the specifics of 
such changes, as well as examine the overall pat-
terns of change that exist in the corpus. It is our 
belief that such a use will enable a more rigorous 
testing and refinement of existing theories of se-
mantic change. 
3.2 A Synchronic Investigation: Phonaes-
themes 
In addition to examining changes in meaning 
across time, it is also possible to employ our me-
thod to examine how the semantic space relates 
to other possible partitioning of the lexemes 
represented by it. For instance, while the rela-
tionship between the phonetic representation and 
semantic content is largely considered to be arbi-
trary, there are some notable exceptions. One 
interesting case is that of phonaesthemes (Firth, 
1930), sub-morphemic units that have a predict-
able effect on the meaning of the word as a 
whole. In English, one of the more frequently 
mentioned phonaesthemes is a word-initial gl- 
which is common in words related to the visual 
modality (e.g., ?glance?, ?gleam?). While there 
have been some scholastic explorations of these 
non-morphological relationships between sound 
and meaning, they have not been thoroughly ex-
plored by behavioral and computational research 
(with some notable exceptions; e.g. Hutchins, 
1998; Bergen, 2004). Recently, Otis and Sagi 
(2008) used the semantic density of the cluster of 
words sharing a phonaestheme as a measure of

the strength of the relationship between the pho-
netic cluster and its proposed meaning.  
Otis and Sagi used a corpus derived from 
Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/) 
as the basis for their analysis. Specifically, they 
used the bulk of the English language literary 
works available through the project?s website. 
This resulted in a corpus of 4034 separate docu-
ments consisting of over 290 million words.  
The bulk of the candidate phonaesthemes they 
tested were taken from the list used by Hutchins 
(1998), with the addition of two candidate pho-
naesthemes (kn- and -ign). Two letter combina-
tions that were considered unlikely to be pho-
naesthemes (br- and z-) were also included in 
order to test the method?s capacity for discrimi-
nating between phonaesthemes and non-
phonaesthemes. Overall Otis and Sagi (2008) 
examined 47 possible phonaesthemes. 
In cases where a phonetic cluster represents a 
phonaestheme, it intuitively follows that pairs of 
words sharing that phonetic cluster are more 
likely to share some aspect of their meaning than 
pairs of words chosen at random. Otis and Sagi 
tested whether this was true for any specific can-
didate phonaestheme using a Monte-Carlo analy-
sis. First they identified all of the words in the 
corpus sharing a conjectured phonaestheme7 and 
chose the most frequent representative word 
form for each stem, resulting in a cluster of word 
types representing each candidate phonaes-
theme.8 Next they tested the statistical signific-
ance of this relationship by running 100 t-test 
comparisons. Each of these tests compared the 
relationship of 50 pairs of words chosen at ran-
dom from the conjectured cluster with 50 pairs of 
words chosen at random from a similarly sized 
cluster, randomly generated from the entire cor-
pus. The number of times these t-tests resulted in 
a statistically significant difference (? = .05) was 
recorded. This analysis was repeated 3 times for 
each conjectured phonaestheme and the median 
value was used as the final result. 
To determine whether a conjectured phonaes-
theme was statistically supported by their analy-
sis Otis and Sagi compared the overall frequency 
                                                 
7 It is important to note that due to the nature of a written 
corpus, the match was orthographical rather than phonetic. 
However, in most cases the two are highly congruent. 
8 Because, in this case, Otis and Sagi were not interested in 
temporal changes in meaning, they used the overall word 
vectors rather than look at each context individually. As a 
result, each of the vectors used in the analysis is based on 
occurrences in many different documents and there was no 
need to control for the variability of the documents.  
of statistically significant t-tests with the binomi-
al distribution for their ? (.05). After applying a 
Bonferroni correction for performing 50 compar-
isons, the threshold for statistical significance of 
the binomial test was for 14 t-tests out of 100 to 
turn out as significant, with a frequency of 13 
being marginally significant. Therefore, if the 
significance frequency (#Sig below) of a candi-
date phonaestheme was 15 or higher, that pho-
naestheme was judged as being supported by 
statistical evidence. Significance frequencies of 
13 and 14 were considered as indicative of a 
phonaestheme for which there was only marginal 
statistical support. 
Among Hutchins? original list of 44 possible 
phonaesthemes, 26 were found to be statistically 
reliable and 2 were marginally reliable. Overall 
the results were in line with the empirical data 
collected by Hutchins. By way of comparing the 
two datasets, #Sig and Hutchins? average rating 
measure were well correlated (r = .53). Neither 
of the unlikely phonaestheme candidates we ex-
amined were statistically supported phonaes-
themes (#Sigbr- = 6; #Sigz- = 5), whereas both of 
our newly hypothesized phonaesthemes were 
statistically supported (#Sigkn- = 28; #Sig-ign = 
23). In addition to being able to use this measure 
as a decision criterion as to whether a specific 
phonetic cluster might be phonaesthemic, it can 
also be used to compare the relative strength of 
two such clusters. For instance, in the Gutenberg 
corpus the phonaesthemic ending ?owl (e.g., 
?growl?, ?howl?; #Sig=97) was comprised of a 
cluster of words that were more similar to one 
another than ?oop (e.g., ?hoop?, ?loop?; #Sig=32).  
Such results can then be used to test the cogni-
tive effects of phonaesthemes. For instance, fol-
lowing the comparison above, we might hypo-
thesize that the word ?growl? might be a better 
semantic prime for ?howl? than the word ?hoop? 
is for the word ?loop?. In contrast, because a 
word-initial br- is not phonaesthemic, the word 
?breeze? is unlikely to be a semantic prime for 
the word ?brick?. In addition, it might be interest-
ing to combine the diachronic analysis from the 
previous section with the synchronic analysis in 
this section to investigate questions such as when 
and how phonaesthemes come to be part of a 
language and what factors might affect the 
strength of a phonaestheme. 
4 Discussion 
While the method presented in this paper is 
aimed towards quantifying semantic relation-
109
ships that were previously difficult to quantify, it 
also raises an interesting theoretical issue, name-
ly the relationship between the statistically com-
puted semantic space and the actual semantic 
content of words. On the one hand, simulations 
based on Latent Semantic Analysis have been 
shown to correlate with cognitive factors such as 
the acquisition of vocabulary and the categoriza-
tion of texts (cf. Landauer & Dumais, 1997). On 
the other hand, in reality speakers? use of lan-
guage relies on more than simple patterns of 
word co-occurrence ? For instance, we use syn-
tactic structures and pragmatic reasoning to sup-
plement the meaning of the individual lexemes 
we come across (e.g., Fodor, 1995; Grice, 1989 
[1975]). It is therefore likely that while LSA cap-
tures some of the variability in meaning exhi-
bited by words in context, it does not capture all 
of it. Indeed, there is a growing body of methods 
that propose to integrate these two disparate 
sources of linguistic information (e.g., Pado and 
Lapata, 2007; Widdows, 2003) 
Certainly, the results reported in this paper 
suggest that enough of the meaning of words and 
contexts is captured to allow interesting infe-
rences about semantic change and the relatedness 
of words to be drawn with a reasonable degree of 
certainty. However, it is possible that some im-
portant aspects of meaning are systematically 
ignored by the analysis. For instance, it remains 
to be seen whether this method can distinguish 
between processes like pejoration and amerliora-
tion as they require a fine grained distinction be-
tween ?good? and ?bad? meanings. 
Regardless of any such limitations, it is clear 
that important information about meaning can be 
gathered through a systematic analysis of the 
contexts in which words appear. Furthermore, 
phenomena such as the existence of phonaes-
themes and the success of LSA in predicting vo-
cabulary acquisition rates, suggest that the acqui-
sition of new vocabulary involves the gleaning of 
the meaning of words through their context. The 
role of context in semantic change is therefore 
likely to be an active one ? when a listener en-
counters a word they are unfamiliar with they are 
likely to use the context in which it appears, as 
well as its phonetic composition, as clues to its 
meaning. Furthermore, if a word is likewise en-
countered in context in which it is unlikely, this 
unexpected observation may induce the listener 
to adjust their representation of both the context 
and the word in order to increase the overall co-
herence of the utterance or sentence. As a result, 
it is possible that examining the contexts in 
which a word is used in different documents and 
time periods might be useful not only as a tool 
for examining the history of a semantic change 
but also as an instrument for predicting its future 
progress. Overall, this suggests a dynamic view 
of the field of semantics ? semantics as an ever-
changing landscape of meaning. In such a view, 
semantic change is the norm as the perceived 
meaning of words keeps shifting to accommo-
date the contexts in which they are used.
