Abstract 
This paper reports on ongoing research into developing large-vocabulary continuous speech 
recognition (LVCSR) for the Welsh language. We address data design issues and the method 
for data collection using a purposely designed application for mobile devices. We also discuss 
the application of the data including the design and collection of a small speech corpus to cov-
er the commands used to control a robotic arm in Welsh on a Raspberry Pi computer the li-
censing of the project and our hopes for the application of the project resources to other lan-
guages.  
1 Introduction 
This paper presents an overview of the GALLU (Gwaith Adnabod Lleferydd Uwch- IPA: [?a??], trans-
lation: further speech recognition work) project to develop speech recognition technology for the 
Welsh language. Wales has a population of around 3 million people, of whom around 20% speak 
Welsh (Office for National Statistics, 2012). Lesser-resourced languages typically lag in digital inno-
vation, including in language technologies. However since 2012, the Welsh Government has updated 
and revised a strategy for supporting Welsh-language technology. Emphasis is placed on ?more tools 
and resources ? to facilitate the use of Welsh, including in the digital environment? (Welsh Govern-
ment, 2012: 45) and ?the development of new Welsh-language software applications and digital ser-
vices? (Welsh Government, 2013; 12). With funding from the Welsh Government and S4C (the Welsh 
language television channel), the GALLU project aims to develop speech recognition technology for 
the Welsh language. The resources will be available under a permissive open-source licence, and will 
therefore be available for use in a broad spectrum of platforms and devices, including voice control for 
smart televisions. 
2 Previous speech technology for Welsh 
Prior to the GALLU project, the most substantial work on Welsh speech technology was developed 
under the WISPR (Welsh and Irish Speech Processing Resources) project (Prys et al., 2004). Previous 
work on a diphone-based synthesiser (Williams, 1994; 1995) and also a small speech database for 
Welsh (Williams, 1999) was built upon by the WISPR project. An improved synthetic Welsh voice 
was developed as part of the WISPR project as well as an MSAPI interface to Festival for use in Mi-
crosoft Windows environments (Bangor University Text to Speech, [no date]). Following the release 
of the WISPR resources under an open-source (BSD) licence, further work was facilitated to develop 
commercial Welsh voices by the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University, by the Finnish 
company Bitlips (Bitlips Text to Speech, [no date]) and the Polish company Ivona (Ivona Text to 
Speech, [no date]). A ?Basic Welsh speech recognition" (Bangor University, [no date]) project at the 
Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University in 2008-9 resulted in laboratory prototypes for a) a 
?command and control? application for a PC where applications could be launched by voice control 
and b) a simple voice-driven calculator. The GALLU project will build on this to develop further 
Welsh speech recognition resources.

3 Data design 
The Welsh language has up to 29 consonants and a large number of vowels: up to 13 monophthongs 
and 13 diphthongs dependent on the variety (Awbery, 1984; Ball, 1984; Jones, 1984; Ball and Wil-
liams, 2001; Mayr and Davies, 2011; amongst others). In order to collect the appropriate data to train 
an acoustic model within HTK ([no date]), a set of phonetically rich words has been designed for con-
tributors to read aloud. In designing the prompt set it was important to ensure that a small number of 
prompts contain representations of all of the phonemes in the language. The WISPR project?s letter-to-
sound rules were rewritten based on data mining from a lexicon, and a list of the most common sounds 
and words was extracted from a text corpus. The final prompt set will contain approximately 200 
prompts (8 words per prompt) covering all of the phonemes in the language which may be recorded by 
contributors across different sessions.

Example 1: Display prompts within the Paldaruo application 
 
A large pronunciation lexicon will be developed and used for speech recognition. The next steps for 
the project involve further data collection and linguistic model development. 
 
4 Data collection: crowdsourcing and the Paldaruo Application 
A large number of speakers are required in order to train the acoustic model which forms the basis of 
the speech recognition system. Recruiting speakers to attend a recording session at a sound booth with 
recording software can prove expensive and time consuming. In attempting to tackle this issue, a 
crowdsourcing approach is being used as a method for collecting data. Crowdsourcing is a low-cost 
and efficient way of collecting speech data.  
A mobile application ?Paldaruo? (Welsh for ?chattering?) has been developed for iOS and Android 
devices. Such devices, with inbuilt microphones and internet connectivity, provide a convenient 
mechanism for many volunteers to contribute speech corpus data. The app is optimised for ease of use 
in order to maximise potential contributions. 
Each volunteer creates their own profile within the app providing metadata related to sex, age, lin-
guistic characteristics and geographical background. Following this, the volunteers explicitly agree to  
their contributions being collected and used. The prompts, described above, are presented one at a time 
and the volunteer records each one individually. The recording is replayed and the volunteer verifies 
the quality or re-records. The user can stop and resume at any time. Prompts are provided to the volun-
teer in a random order; completed prompts will be included in the corpus even if the user does not rec-
ord the full set. 
The app accesses the microphone of the user?s mobile device and records 48 kHz PCM files, which 
are sent to a server developed and hosted by the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University. 
Uploads are queued in the background so that network speed issues do not interrupt the recording pro-
cess.

The app was evaluated in a pilot application (see 5) and proved successful in obtaining a useful speech 
corpus from invited volunteers. However issues were highlighted with regards to background noise 
and recording volume levels. To address this, the app now includes background noise and volume lev-
el checks. 
 
The official media launch of the app, with the final prompt set, will take place on 7th July 2014. There 
will be television coverage on S4C with high-profile individuals including the First Minister of Wales 
and celebrities providing endorsements and appeals for volunteers. 
 
5 Data Application 
5.1 Pilot Data Application 
To date a small pilot speech corpus has been collected with the Paldaruo app covering the phonemes 
that appear in a vocabulary to control a robotic arm. 20 speakers contributed to this corpus and record-
ed 38 prompts (approx. 200 words) each, totalling around 4000 words. Certain commands, for instance 
?up?, exhibit dialect-dependent lexical variation, and in these cases every speaker recorded both re-
gional forms.

troi i?r chwith                    turn to the left 
 
This corpus has been used to develop a pilot speaker-independent Welsh-language speech recognition 
system for controlling the robotic arm. The pilot system uses HTK ([no date]) and Julius ([no date]), 
and follows the design of an existing English system (AonSquared, [no date]). It controls the robotic 
arm from a Raspberry Pi (a credit card-sized computer, popular in schools and coding clubs, costing 
around ?35; see (Raspberry Pi Foundation, [No date]). The authors hope this simple demonstration 
will be recreated in schools and coding clubs for children throughout Wales, fitting in with the Welsh 
57
Government?s aim to support initiatives aimed at encouraging and supporting young people to engage 
?in the digital world in a Welsh-language context? (Welsh Government, 2013: 14). 
 
5.2 Licensing 
GALLU will follow the successful strategy of the WISPR project in using permissive open-source li-
censing. All outputs will be made available under the MIT licence (MIT, [No date]) which allows roy-
alty-free use in both open-source and proprietary systems, including desktop computer software, web 
applications, mobile apps and embedded systems such as television set firmware. 
 
This strategy allows the widest possible use of the project?s outputs, and the maximal availability of 
Welsh speech recognition technology. 
 
5.3 Application to other languages 
The authors hope other lesser-resourced languages can harness the project?s outputs and experience. 
The source code of the Paldaruo crowdsourcing app can easily be adapted for use in other languages. 
The process for developing the LVCSR system has been documented and will be published in the 
form of a tutorial. All project outputs, including the source code for the app, will be available under 
the MIT licence.

Abstract 
This paper describes the on-going project on Digitization, E-publishing and Electronic Corpus 
(DECHE). It also describes the building of a common infrastructure and portal for displaying 
and disseminating other Welsh language and bilingual Welsh/English text corpora. An over-
view is given of other corpora included in the on-line corpus portal, as well as corpora intend-
ed for future publication through the portal site. This is done within the context of developing 
resources frugally and efficiently for less-resourced languages. 
 
1 Introduction 
Electronic language corpora are some of the most essential resources both for contemporary linguistic 
research and the development of new language technology applications. They also present a challenge 
to Welsh and other Celtic languages as smaller languages that are invariably under-resourced with re-
gards to the availability of and interest in funding language technologies. Existing resources need to be 
recycled, updated, and presented in accessible formats in order to be useful to a new generation of re-
searchers. Although the whole world wide web is now, in some sense, available as an on-line corpus 
(Gatto, 2014), and that notable attempts have been made to use it to build linguistic corpora, foremost 
amongst them Kevin Scannell?s Cr?bad?n Project for less resourced languages (Scannell, 2007), we 
believe that there is still a need for specific text corpora in different domains and for various uses that 
are easily searchable and accessible to a wide academic community and beyond. This paper provides a 
brief overview of how a piecemeal collection of Welsh corpora are being brought together into a co-
herent, online, freely accessible and expanding Welsh National Corpus Portal (Porth Corpora 
Cenedlaethol Cymru, [no date]) 
 
2. From the first corpus to National Portal 
 
The catalyst for the development of the Welsh National Corpus Portal was the awarding of a grant for 
the DECHE Project. DECHE (Digido, E-gyhoeddi a Chorpws Electronig, translated as Digitization, E-
publishing and Electronic Corpus), is funded by Y Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (The Welsh National 
College). This is a virtual college established by the Welsh Government in 2011 to promote and deliv-
er Welsh-medium university education in Wales, including the creation of new Welsh language aca-
demic resources. The primary aim of the DECHE project is to produce e-books out of Welsh language 
scholarly, academic books which are out of print and unlikely to be reprinted in traditional paper for-
mat. Candidates for producing as e-books are nominated by lecturers working though the medium of 
Welsh, and prioritized by the Coleg Cymraeg, according to best fit with the Coleg?s Academic Devel-
opment Plan (Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol, 2011). The current project processes around 30 books a 
year, which are published on Y Porth (Y Porth, [no date]), the Coleg?s own portal website for Welsh

academic teaching resources. Books are scanned at the National Library of Wales, and passed to the 
project?s purpose built OCR software. Human based proofreading and corrections are made before 
final publishing into E-PUB (readable by most e-readers) and Mobi (for Kindle) formats. PDFs are 
also produced for the purpose of printing personal copies.  
 
2.1 DECHE Corpus of Welsh Scholarly Writing 
 
The creation of a corpus of academic Welsh writing (named DECHE Corpus of Welsh Scholarly Writ-
ing) is a spin off from this primary e-book activity, taking advantage of the fact that these books are 
being digitized in any case for another purpose. The original OCR process produces a text which still 
contains many errors, especially in dealing with Welsh accented characters and other linguistic peculi-
arities. Therefore the human proofreading stage is vital in producing high quality and clean text. Hu-
man involvement in the workflow allows in addition for metadata such as the book title, author, date 
of publication, keywords, and subject fields, as well as limited annotations within the text body to be 
input into the corpus. To date 30 books have been added into the corpus, giving a total of approximate-
ly 450,000 words. This total will rise annually during the lifetime of the project. 
 
2.2 Welsh National Corpus Portal 
 
The Welsh National Corpus Portal was developed as a means of fulfilling not only the secondary ob-
jectives of the DECHE project, but also to serve for the first time as an opportunity to plan and present 
other Welsh language related corpus resources. The corpus portal was inspired by the Welsh National 
Terminology Portal (Porth Termau Cenedlaethol Cymru, [no date]), which serves as an online one 
stop shop for displaying and searching tens of standardized terminology dictionaries. Although web-
sites such as that of SketchEngine (Kilgarriff et al, 2004) provide an overarching interface to query 
many corpora in a number of languages, including Welsh, they deal mainly with major languages with 
ample corpus resources. Many smaller languages are still poorly endowed with corpus resources of 
any kind, and the Welsh National Corpus Portal seems a rare example of an attempt to bring together 
disparate resources for such a language. 
The Welsh National Corpus Portal infrastructure supports importing text resources as well as a 
search tool for both monolingual and bilingual corpora. A corpus management interface was devel-
oped in-house in order to facilitate tasks such as importing texts to the on-line corpora, using a ?submit 
to website? button by project staff, without the intervention of software experts. In the case of the 
DECHE corpus, the infrastructure supports importing the finally published e-pub files. Publication 
level metadata is also collected and stored in the infrastructure with imported texts. In the case of bi-
lingual corpora, CSV and TMX file formats are supported.  
The corpus portal?s search and import functionalities employ natural language processing 
components for segmentation and lemmatization. The segmentation tool was originally developed in-
house for use in translation memory software, and the lemmatizer was originally developed for the 
Cysill grammar and spelling program. Lemmatization enables searching through the Portal?s Welsh 
language texts for all forms of a given search word, including mutations forms and conjugated verbs. 
For example, typing in ?canu? (to sing) will also return all possible forms of the lemma, including 
?cenir? (present impersonal form of the verb), ?ganodd? third person past tense with soft mutation, 
?nghanu? (verb noun form with a nasal mutation) and ?cheni? (second person present form of the verb 
with a spirant mutation).  
 
3 Other published corpora 
3.1 Criteria for including corpora in the National Portal 
To date, only corpora developed at the LTU itself, or that the LTU has inherited responsibility for, are 
included in the Portal. This is for practical reasons, in that these corpora have been designed or 
adapted in house specifically for inclusion in the Portal, their format is compatible with that of the Por-
tal.  
72
Other useful Welsh corpora available on-line are listed on the web-site, with a link provided to 
their own web-sites. It is hoped in future that corpora from other sources will become available for 
inclusion in the National Portal, and that information about other unpublished corpora will also be 
made available there. 
 
3.2 The CEG corpus 
The first major Welsh electronic corpus to be collected was the CEG (Corpws Electroneg o?r Gym-
raeg) corpus in the early 1990s (Ellis, N.C. et al. 2001). This was designed as a lexical and word count 
corpus of samples of around 2,000 word segments from various genres of fiction and non-fiction re-
sulting in a 1 million word corpus. This was innovative in its time and together with an associated part 
of speech tagger and lemmatizer, was a major contribution to Welsh corpus studies. However, as time 
went by CEG became difficult to access and use, and due to numerous requests for help from individ-
ual scholars, the decision was made to port it, together with the attendant metadata, into the Welsh Na-
tional Corpus Portal. The original CEG files and data however were also ported to a new server and 
have been maintained on-line in addition to the new format. 
3.3 The National Assembly for Wales Record parallel text corpora 
Similar to the Hansard produced by the UK parliament at Westminster, the National Assembly of 
Wales produce and publish a bilingual record of its main chamber?s proceedings.  Assembly members 
may speak in either Welsh or English. Their words are transcribed and translated into the other lan-
guage, creating a bilingual record of what is said. The written proceedings are carefully translated and 
edited, and thus provide an excellent resource for a variety of research and development purposes. 
An early version of a parallel text corpus from the National Assembly of Wales Record was created by 
Jones and Eisele in 2006 (Jones et al, 2006). This covered the period of the first assembly 1999-2003 
and has been included into the Welsh National Corpus Portal.  A further corpus produced by the 
CATCymru project (CATCymru, 2009), covering the third assembly (2007-2010) has also been in-
cluded into the Portal. Both corpora provide in total approximately 850,000 parallel segments and a 
word count of 20 million. Thus when added together these corpora have been a valuable resource for a 
wide spectrum of users from statistical machine translation practitioners to freelance translators who 
make heavy use of the portal?s search facilities in conjunction with their terminology searches.  
The National Assembly for Wales has streamlined and simplified its publication of the record. It also 
currently has a machine translation strategy with Microsoft to speed up the translation of the Assembly 
Record and lower costs. It is likely therefore that this particular collection in the corpus portal will 
grow substantially over the coming months and years.  
3.4    The experimental language register corpus 
This is a very small corpus extracted from the much larger but as yet unpublished Corpws Cysill Ar-
lein (see 4.1). Its purpose is to study linguistic features of various language registers, especially with a 
view to developing methods of accurately tagging and recognizing texts according to their language 
register. This forms part of a Welsh Government and S4C project on speech recognition, but it is fore-
seen that a corpus of language registers will also be of much wider interest to the academic communi-
ty. The corpus is still under development, but can already be accessed through the Welsh National 
Corpus Portal. 
 
4 Unpublished corpora 
4.1 The Cysill Ar-lein corpus 
A special, free on-line version of a Welsh language spelling and grammar checker, Cysill 
(Cysill Ar-lein, 2009), was created with a view of collecting user generated samples of Welsh texts. 
This automatically generates a corpus of errors, with the corrected texts collected also from the users? 
73
sessions. The on-line version of Cysill has been very popular for a number of years. During four 
months of use in early 2014, the corpus grew by 2.5 million words, an average monthly total of 
650,000 words of text throughput. To date the corpus comprises upwards of 14 million words each in 
corrected and uncorrected versions.  
An analysis of the content shows a wide variety of text types, ranging from school and student 
essays to job applications, journalistic articles, formal documents, blogs, tweets and e-mails. Although 
use of this corpus for academic research was clearly stated in the terms and conditions, with warnings 
concerning privacy and confidentiality, sensitive material such as job applications and CVs containing 
names and addresses are common in it. Publication has been frustrated by users? lack of attention to 
these warnings, and it is inadvisable to publish without reasonable quality of anonymization. It is 
however available internally for research purposes, and has been used by staff and students, notably by 
Wooldridge (Wooldridge, 2011) in her MRes study of interference from English on Welsh texts. 
 
4.2 The corpora of 19th century and World War I Welsh newspapers   
The latter part of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century was the golden age of 
Welsh newspaper publishing. There was a large literate Welsh public who had not yet learnt English 
who supported a thriving Welsh language press. A recent project to create a website of resources for 
the First World War in Wales (Cymru 1914, [no date]), sponsored by JISC (a registered charity that 
champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research), and led by the National Li-
brary of Wales, included a task to provide gist machine translation of the Welsh language newspapers 
into English. Unlike translations carried out to an accepted standard by human translators, gist transla-
tions only aim to provide a rough idea of the contents. They need not be polished in terms of language 
or always accurate in terms of meaning, but they provide a quick and cheap way to access source texts 
in a language which is unknown to the reader. 
In order to complete this task, digitized copies of the Welsh newspapers from the war period 
were used, totalling approximately 11 million words. The much larger collection of digitized pre-war 
collection of Welsh newspapers, totalling approximately 223 million words was also received by the 
project, to be used as training data. Both these bodies of texts were imported into the Welsh National 
Corpus Portal infrastructure for ease of manipulation.  
The quality of the digitization of these newspapers is not very high, due to the poor ink and 
paper quality. The unstandardized orthography and old fashioned language can also cause difficulties, 
and further work on this corpus could include the use of automatic standardization techniques similar 
to those used by Scannell (Scannell, 2009) for the Irish language. Nevertheless this could still be a 
very valuable corpus of Welsh, especially since it is by far the largest corpus of Welsh available. Ef-
forts are currently under way to obtain permission to publish these corpora. In the meantime they are 
searchable internally and have been used in a chunking exercise to develop language models for 
speech technology and machine translation for Welsh. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The Welsh National Corpus Portal to date includes a corpus of contemporary academic Welsh, a lega-
cy corpus of Welsh designed for word count and lexical purposes, a bilingual corpus of parliamentary 
Welsh, and an experimental corpus of different language registers. Adding to these the Cysill corpus 
of errors, and the nineteenth and early twentieth century newspaper corpora gives us an unexpectedly 
broad and deep range of Welsh language corpora. Given that only the DECHE corpus and experi-
mental corpus of registers received any grant funding, and only as secondary considerations to other 
primary objectives, a great deal has been accomplished in recent years. Further work aims to expand 
the collection and integrate more natural Welsh language processing tools to aid annotation analysing 
and searching. It is hoped that the Welsh National Corpus Portal will continue to grow and provide 
inspiration for other less-resourced languages facing similar challenges.
