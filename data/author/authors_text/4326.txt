Abstract 
This paper proposes a unified evalua-
tion method for multiple reading sup-
port systems such as a sentence 
translation system and a word transla-
tion system.  In reading a non-native 
language text, these systems aim to 
lighten the reading burden.  When we 
evaluate the performance of these sys-
tems, we cannot rely solely on these 
tests, as the output forms are different.  
Therefore, we must assess the perform-
ance of these systems based on the us-
ers? reading comprehension and 
reading speed.  We will further support 
our findings with experimental results.  
They show that the reading-speed pro-
cedure is able to evaluate the support 
systems, as well as, the comprehension-
based procedure proposed by Ohguro 
(1993) and Fuji et al (2001). 
1 Introduction 
This paper presents an evaluation method for 
different reading support systems such as a sen-
tence-machine translation system (henceforth, 
an MT-system) and a word/phrase translation 
system (henceforth, a w/p-MT-system).  Al-
though, there are various manual/automatic 
evaluation methods for these systems, e.g., 
BLEU (Papineni et al 2002), these methods are 
basically incapable of dealing with an MT-
system and a w/p-MT-system at the same time, 
as they have different output forms.  On the con-
trary, there are further methods which examine 
the efficacy of these systems (Ohguro 1993; Fuji 
et al 2001).  These studies demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of the reading support systems by 
comparing reading comprehension test scores 
between an English-only text and the one with 
outputs of either an MT-system (Fuji et al 2001) 
or a w/p-MT-system (Ohguro 1993). 
In our evaluation method, we examined the 
system based not only con comprehension but 
also on speed, i.e., reading efficacy (Alderson 
2000).  If the system supports a user in an appro-
priate way, then the reading efficacy would in-
crease from the bottom line, i.e., text without any 
support.  The previous studies focused mainly on 
reading comprehension.  We will now broaden 
our examination to include reading speed. 
We are able to evaluate a system based on 
single sentences, as we measure sentence-
reading speed.  In contrast, we are unable to 
carry out such a local domain evaluation solely 
based on the comprehension performance. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
reviews the previous studies, which evaluated 
reading support systems based on the compre-
hension performance, i.e., Ohguro (1993) and 
Fuji et al (2001); Section 3 describes our 
evaluation method, which evaluates both an 
244
MT-system and a w/p-MT-system based on 
speed performance; Section 4 reports the ex-
perimental results.  Through the experiments, 
we confirmed that the speed performance-based 
evaluation basically parallels the comprehension 
performance-based evaluation; and finally Sec-
tion 5 presents our conclusions and future work. 
2 The Comprehension-based Methods 
2.1 Ohguro (1993) 
Ohguro (1993) carried out an experiment in 
which the efficacy of an English-Japanese w/p-
MT-system was examined and reported that a 
w/p-MT-system would be of more aid to those 
with a lower reading ability.  Fifty-four non-
native English speakers took part in the experi-
ment.  Ohguro (1993) prepared 28 texts with 80 
comprehension questions extracted from various 
Test of English for International Communication 
(TOEIC) texts. 
The experiment held two phases.  First, all 
the participants read 14 English-only texts and 
answered 40 comprehension questions.  On the 
basis of the test score, the participants were di-
vided into two groups so as to balance the read-
ing ability between them.  Then, Ohguro (1993) 
gave English-only texts to one group, the control 
group, and provided texts supported with the a 
w/p-MT-system to the other group. 
Ohguro (1993) hypothesized that the control 
group would get similar test scores on both tests, 
as opposed to varying test scores from the other 
group.  In addition, it was predicted that the 
scores of the non-control group would depend on 
the reading ability of the group members with 
respect to TOEIC scores (Hypothesis I).  That is, 
a higher test score would be expected for those 
with a lower TOEIC score group.  Thus, Hy-
pothesis I was incorrect given the results.  Oh-
guro (1993) reanalysed the increase in the test 
scores by dividing that group into two.  Under 
this revised analysis, he hypothesized that a 
greater increase in score would be shown in the 
second test by those with lower initial scores (the 
revised Hypothesis I).  This revised hypothesis 
was correct given the result.  Ohguro (1993) con-
cluded that the supporting effect of a w/p-MT-
system was greater for those who had a lower 
reading ability than those highly skilled readers. 
2.2 Fuji et al (2001) 
Fuji et al (2001) examined how the efficacy of 
an English-Japanese MT system varied depend-
ing on English reading ability.  Approximately 
200 non-native English speakers participated in 
the experiment.  The participants were divided 
into 12 groups based on their TOEIC scores.  
The score range was between (i) less than 395 
and (ii) more than 900.  Fuji et al (2001) pre-
pared three types of texts.  One was an English-
only text as a control text, another contained 
only translated sentences by an MT-system, 
and the other involved both English texts and 
the MT-system outputs.  Each participant read 
14 texts, and answered 40 comprehension ques-
tions. 
Through this experiment, Fuji et al (2001) 
observed that translation-only texts would de-
grade the test scores for the higher TOEIC score 
group, while the lower score group exhibited no 
degrading effect.  In addition, they found that 
English texts with MT-outputs might increase 
the test scores for the lower score group more 
greatly than the higher score group. 
With respect to the test completion time, Fuji 
et al (2001) observed that an MT-system highly 
shortened the time for the lower score group 
relative to the higher score group. 
2.3 Summary 
Through the surveys of these studies, we were 
able to confirm that both a w/p-MT-system and 
an MT-system exhibited greater supporting ef-
fects on the lower TOEIC score group than the 
higher TOEIC score group. 
3 Evaluation with Reading Speed 
3.1 The purpose 
The purpose of our evaluation is to pursue the 
efficacy of reading support systems with respect 
not only to the users? reading ability but also to 
the readability of a complete text or a single sen-
tence.  That is, we would like to explicate 
through the evaluation whether the supporting 
effect might change due to the text properties 
such as complexity of a syntactic structure, fa-
miliarity of words, and so on. 
In order to depict such a local effect, we as-
sume that the comprehension-based evaluation 
245
would be inappropriate, as it is inefficient to 
assign a comprehension question to each sen-
tence.  Suppose that we could evaluate reading 
support systems regarding such a local domain.  
Then, we could choose which system is proper, 
depending on his/her reading ability and the 
readability of a text.  Such usage of reading sup-
port systems would be useful. 
3.2 Reading Speed as an Evaluation Criterion 
In our evaluation method, we adopt reading 
speed performance as an evaluation criterion in 
addition to the comprehension performance.  
There are three reasons for this adoption of read-
ing speed. 
First, in contrast to reading comprehension, 
we can measure sentence-reading speed, and 
thus we can examine system efficacy on a sen-
tence-level. 
Secondly, reading speed can be measured 
with any texts which is readable by the reading 
support systems.  For instance, we can evaluate 
system efficacy for texts such as newspapers, 
magazine articles, web pages, emails, and so on.  
By contrast, the comprehension-based evalua-
tion requires comprehension questions. 
Thirdly, as shown below, we have statisti-
cally found that the reading speed reflects the 
readability of a sentence.  We confirmed the 
positive correlation (r=0.7, p<0.01) between 
reading speed and readability of a text calculated 
with the so-called readability formula (Flesch 
1948).  Given this positive correlation, we as-
sumed that reading speed indicates readability.  
Thus, a direct relationship exists between read-
ability and reading speed. 
3.3 Reading Speed-based Evaluation 
Method 
Assuming that reading speed reflects text read-
ability, we can further assume that the reading 
support systems would affect text readability.  
That is, the positive supporting effect of a sys-
tem would increase the text readability.  Given 
this, we can evaluate the efficacy of a system on 
the basis of reading speed. 
Our evaluation method accepts the positive 
effect of a system if the reading speed is in-
creased.  When the reading speed remains in-
variant, or decreases, the method regards a 
system as inefficient.  Thus, if we compare the 
reading speed between a supported and a non-
supported text, the increase of speed should be 
greater for those who have a lower reading abil-
ity than the highly skilled people on the basis of 
previous studies. 
4 Evaluation Experiment 
4.1 The Experimental Purpose 
We conducted an experiment in order to exam-
ine the validity of our method.  Given the read-
ing speed evaluation method, it is predicted 
that reading speed would reflect readability of 
a text (Hypothesis 1) and reader?s ability (Hy-
pothesis 2). 
As for readability of a text, we assume that 
supporting systems would increase readability 
of a text.  Therefore, we set the following hy-
pothesis: 
 
Hypothesis 1: 
A non-supported English text would be the 
most difficult to read, whereas a manually 
translated Japanese text would be the easiest.  
Supported text would fall mid-range. 
 
The efficacy of the supporting systems is in-
versely related to the reader?s ability, as the pre-
vious studies have shown.  Therefore, we 
propose the following hypothesis: 
 
Hypothesis2: 
The inverse relation is detectable between the 
reading ability and the reading speed increase. 
 
4.2 The Experimental Design 
One hundred and two non-native English 
speakers participated in the experiment.  We 
divided the participants into three groups 
based on their TOEIC scores: (i) those with a 
lower score (400-595 pts.), (ii) those with an 
intermediate score (600-795 pts.); and (iii) 
those with a higher score (800-995 pts.).  The 
group sizes were: (i) = 36, (ii) = 36, and (iii) = 
30.  We statistically compared average test 
scores and reading speed among these groups. 
We prepared eighty-four texts out of our 
sourced TOEIC texts.  Each text consists of a 
passage and some comprehension questions.  
We added outputs of supporting systems to 
each text. 
246
In this experiment, we examined the effi-
cacy of the following supporting systems: a 
sentence translation system, a word/phrase 
translation system, and a chunker.  Thus, we 
created four types of test texts: (i) English 
texts glossed with sentence translations (here-
after, E&MT); (ii) machine-translated texts 
(MT); (iii) English texts glossed with word 
translation (RUB); and (iv) English texts with 
word/phrase boundary markers (CHU). 
In addition, we prepared two types of con-
trol texts.  One is a raw English text, and the 
other is a human-translated Japanese text.  We 
randomly selected sixteen texts from each text 
group and distributed eighty-four to each par-
ticipant.  Thus, the participants are exposed to 
a variety of texts. 
In the experiment we used a reading process 
monitoring tool and recorded the reading time 
per sentence (see Yoshimi et al 2005 for further 
description).  We calculated the sentence read-
ing speed based on words per minute (WPM) 
read.  As the cursor moves over each number 
bar, the text is displayed sentence-by-sentence.  
See Figure 1.  There is no limit to how many 
times a sentence can be viewed. 
 
 
Figure 1. Screenshot of the monitoring tool 
We omitted the machine-translated words 
and focused solely on the number of English 
words to calculate the reading speed.  Therefore, 
we were able to directly compare the reading 
speed of a supported text to that of a non-
supported English text. 
The goal of this study is to depict the effi-
cacy of the support systems.  Hence, the actual 
reading speed of an English and Japanese 
mixed text was out of the scope.  If reading 
speed was calculated based on both English 
and Japanese words, the reading speed of a 
supported text would be faster than an English 
text, even though the reading time was the 
same.  This is due to a greater number of words 
in the supported text.  Therefore, we calculated 
reading speed based solely on English words to 
account for this implausible effect.  We also 
applied this procedure to a manually translated 
Japanese text. 
4.3 Experimental Results 
4.3.1 Tested Data 
Before presenting the experimental results, 
one clarification is in order here.  We chose to 
analyse a manageable 13 reading texts of the 
whole data, i.e., 84 reading texts.  The texts 
we used varied in topic, style, and length.  For 
instance, they were article-based texts, reports, 
and advertisements.  Among these texts, we 
examined article type texts. 
There were two reasons for this limitation.  
One concern was with the performance of the 
reading support systems.  We assumed that the 
system performance was dependant on text 
styles, and that the system would most effec-
tively support reading of article type texts be-
cause they contained less stylistic variations 
compared with other types of texts, particu-
larly, advertisements. 
The other concern was with text length.  
Article type texts tended to be longer than the 
others, and hence were more conducive to the 
supporting effect of the systems as shown in 
Table 1.

Article texts 142.9 9.6

4.3.2 Testing Hypothesis 1: Reading Speed 
We are able to conclude in Hypothesis 1 that 
the reading speed of a supported text is slower 
than that of a non-supported English text.  See 
Table 2.  Therefore, the hypothesis is incorrect 
with respect to the slowest speeds.  However, in 
regards to the fastest reading speed, Hypothesis 
1 was supported.

4.3.3 Testing Hypothesis 1: Comprehension 
Hypothesis 1 was not supported for the lowest 
comprehension scores, paralleling reading 
speed results.  Thus, the lowest score was 
found in the MT texts as shown in Table 3.  
The results supported the hypothesis in respect 
to the JPN texts scoring highest.

JPN 0.93 0.15 0.90 to 0.95 
Table 3. Mean percentatge of questions answered correctly. 
In order to analyse the reading data in more 
detail, we compared the correct answer rates 
among the TOEIC test score groups.  We di-
vided the participants into three groups based on 
TOEIC scores: 400-595 (BEGinner), 600-795 
(INTermediate), and 800-995 (ADVanced). 
The correct answer rate of each group is 
shown in Table 4.  In the BEG class, the lowest 
rate was found in English texts, and the highest 
was seen in Japanese texts.  Although the high-
est rate can be seen in Japanese texts, the lowest 
was found in MT texts in the INT class and 
ADV class. 
On the basis of comprehension test results, 
we confirmed that all the supporting systems 
increased comprehension test scores for the 
BEG class, E&MT for the INT class, but not for 
the ADV class.

E&MT 0.87 0.93 0.91 
JPN 0.87 0.96 0.94 
Table 4. The correct answer rate by TOEIC score group 
On the basis of this result, we conclude that 
the reading support systems help the lowest 
TOEIC score group participants, while the sup-
porting effect would be minor for the higher 
score group. 
We analysed the mean rate with one-way 
ANOVA by contrasting the ENG texts or the JPN 
texts.  The result is shown in Table 5.  The asterisk 
refers to a non-significant difference, while the 
check mark shows a significant difference. 
In the BEG class, the rate of correct answers 
in the ENG texts was significantly lower than in 
the E&MT texts.  There was no text that signifi-
cantly differed from the JPN texts. 
In the INT class, there was no significant dif-
ference compared with the ENG texts, while the 
rate of the JPN texts significantly differed from 
the CHU, RUB, and MT texts. 
In the ADV class, there was no significant 
difference comparing with the ENG texts.  The 
rate of the JPN texts showed a significant differ-
ence from the MT texts.

4.3.4 Testing Hypothesis 2 
We found variances in the Hypothesis 1.  
Thus, the most readable text was the JPN texts, 
whereas the least readable text was not the ENG 
texts but the RUB texts(Table 3).  In addition, 
the other supported texts, the CHU, RUB, and 
E&MT texts were less readable than the non-
supported ENG texts.  However, the MT texts 
were more readable than the ENG texts.  There-
248
fore, we were able to conclude that Hypothesis 1 
was supported among the ENG, MT, and JPN 
texts. 
Given this, we focused on these texts and 
found that Hypotheses 2 was correct.  As Table 
6 shows, the reading speed of the MT texts was 
faster than the ENG texts in all the groups.  The 
increase of the speed was inversely related to the 
readers? ability.  Thus, the increase was 47.3 in 
the BEG class; 25.4 in the INT class; and 10.9 in 
the ADV class.

the ADV class, there was no text that signifi-
cantly deferred from the ENG texts.  The reading 
speed of the JPN texts was significantly faster 
than the other texts in all the classes.  See Table 8.

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented the reading speed-
based evaluation method for reading support 
systems.  On the basis of the experiment, we 
found that the method articulated the perform-
ance of the systems, such as a chunker, a word-
translation system, and a sentence-translation 
system.  We found that only a sentence-
translation showed the supporting effect.  How-
ever, this supporting effect was not available for 
the advanced English learners. 
We have not yet discussed crossing effects of 
comprehension result and speed result, but we 
will expect the further study would reveal it.

Abstract
The quality of a sentence translated by a
machine translation (MT) system is dif-
ficult to evaluate. We propose a method
for automatically evaluating the quality
of each translation. In general, when
translating a given sentence, one or more
conditions should be satisfied to maintain
a high translation quality. In English-
Japanese translation, for example, prepo-
sitions and infinitives must be appropri-
ately translated. We show several proce-
dures that enable evaluating the quality of
a translated sentence more appropriately
than using conventional methods. The
first procedure is constructing a test set
where the conditions are assigned to each
test-set sentence in the form of yes/no
questions. The second procedure is devel-
oping a system that determines an answer
to each question. The third procedure is
combining a measure based on the ques-
tions and conventional measures. We also
present a method for automatically gener-
ating sub-goals in the form of yes/no ques-
tions and estimating the rate of accom-
plishment of the sub-goals. Promising re-
sults are shown.
1 Introduction
In machine translation (MT) research, appropriately
evaluating the quality of MT results is an important
issue. In recent years, many researchers have tried
to automatically evaluate the quality of MT and im-
prove the performance of automatic MT evaluations
(Niessen et al, 2000; Akiba et al, 2001; Papineni et
al., 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al, 2003; Turian et
al., 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och,
2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gimen?ez et al,
2005) because improving the performance of auto-
matic MT evaluation is expected to enable us to use
and improve MT systems efficiently. For example,
Och reported that the quality of MT results was im-
proved by using automatic MT evaluation measures
for the parameter tuning of an MT system (Och,
2003). This report shows that the quality of MT re-
sults improves as the performance of automatic MT
evaluation improves.
MT systems can be ranked if a set of MT re-
sults for each system and their reference translations
are given. Usually, about 300 or more sentences
are used to automatically rank MT systems (Koehn,
2004). However, the quality of a sentence translated
by an MT system is difficult to evaluate. For exam-
ple, the results of five MTs into Japanese of the sen-
tence ?The percentage of stomach cancer among the
workers appears to be the highest for any asbestos
workers.? are shown in Table 1. A conventional au-
tomatic evaluation method ranks the fifth MT result
first although its human subjective evaluation is the
lowest. This is because conventional methods are
based on the similarity between a translated sentence
and its reference translation, and they give the trans-
lated sentence a high score when the two sentences
are globally similar to each other in terms of lexical
overlap. However, in the case of the above example,

the most important thing to maintain a high trans-
lation quality is to correctly translate ?for? into the
target language, and it would be difficult to detect
the importance just by comparing an MT result and
its reference translations even if the number of ref-
erence translations is increased.
In general, when translating a given sentence, one
or more conditions should be satisfied to maintain a
high translation quality. In this paper, we show that
constructing a test set where the conditions that are
mainly established from a linguistic point of view
are assigned to each test-set sentence in the form
of yes/no questions, developing a system that de-
termines an answer to each question, and combin-
ing a measure based on the questions and conven-
tional measures enable the evaluation of the quality
of a translated sentence more appropriately than us-
ing conventional methods. We also present a method
for automatically generating sub-goals in the form of
yes/no questions and estimating the rate of accom-
plishment of the sub-goals.
2 Test Set for Evaluating Machine
Translation Quality
2.1 Test Set
Two main types of data are used for evaluating MT
quality. One type of data is constructed by arbi-
trarily collecting sentence pairs in the source- and
target-languages, and the other is constructed by in-
tensively collecting sentence pairs that include lin-
guistic phenomena that are difficult to automatically
translate. Recently, MT evaluation campaigns such
as the International Workshop on Spoken Language
Translation 1, NISTMachine Translation Evaluation
2
, and HTRDP Evaluation 3 were organized to sup-
port the improvement of MT techniques. The data
used in the evaluation campaigns were arbitrarily
collected from newspaper articles or travel conver-
sation data for fair evaluation. They are classified
as the former type of data mentioned above. On the
other hand, the data provided by NTT (Ikehara et al,
1994) and that constructed by JEIDA (Isahara, 1995)
are classified as the latter type. Almost all the data
mentioned above consist of only parallel translations
in two languages. Data with information for evaluat-
ing MT results, such as JEIDA?s are rarely found. In
this paper, we call data that consist of parallel trans-
lations collected for MT evaluation and that the in-
formation for MT evaluation is assigned to, a test
set.
The most characteristic information assigned to
the JEIDA test set is the yes/no question for assess-
ing the translation results. For example, a yes/no
question such as ?Is ?for? translated into an expres-
sion representing a cause/reason such as ?de??? (in
Japanese) is assigned to a test-set sentence. We can
evaluate MT results objectively by answering the
question. An example of a test-set sample consist-
ing of an ID, a source-language sample sentence, its
reference translation, and a question is as follows.

roudousha no igan no wariai wa
, asubesuto roudousha no tame
ni saikou to naru youda .
Question Is ?appear to? translated into an
auxiliary verb such as ?youda??
The questions are classified mainly in terms of
grammar, and the numbers to the left of the hyphen-
ation of each ID such as 1.1.7.1.3 represent the cat-
egories of the questions. For example, the above
question is related to catenative verbs.
The JEIDA test set consists of two parts, one for
the evaluation of English-Japanese MT and the other
for that of Japanese-English MT. We focused on the
part for English-Japanese MT. This part consists of
769 sample sentences, each of which has a yes/no
question.
The 769 sentences were translated by using five
commercial MT systems to investigate the relation-
ship between subjective evaluation based on yes/no
questions and conventional subjective evaluation
based on fluency and adequacy. The instruction for
the subjective evaluation based on fluency and ad-
equacy followed that given in the TIDES specifi-
cation (TIDES, 2002). The subjective evaluation
based on yes/no questions was done by manually
answering each question for each translation. The
subjective evaluation based on the yes/no questions
was stable; namely, it was almost independent of
the human subjects in our preliminary investigation.
There were only two questions for which the an-
swers generated inconsistency in the subjective eval-
uation when 1,500 question-answer pairs were ran-
domly sampled and evaluated by two human sub-
jects.
Then, we investigated the correlation between the
two types of subjective evaluation. The correlation
coefficients mentioned in this paper are statistically
significant at the 1% or less significance level. The
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is used
in this paper. In the subjective evaluation based on
yes/no questions, yes and no were numerically trans-
formed into 1 and ?1. For 3,845 translations ob-
tained by using five MT systems, the correlation co-
efficients between the subjective evaluations based
on yes/no questions and based on fluency and ade-
quacy were 0.48 for fluency and 0.63 for adequacy.
These results indicate that the two subjective evalu-
ations have relatively strong correlations. The cor-
relation is especially strong between the subjective
evaluation based on yes/no questions and adequacy.
2.2 Expansion of JEIDA Test Set
Each sample sentence in the JEIDA test set has only
one question. Therefore, in the subjective evalua-
tion using the JEIDA test set, translation errors that
do not involve the pre-assigned question are ignored
even if they are serious. Therefore, translations that
have serious errors that are not related to the ques-
tion tend to be evaluated as being of high quality.
To solve this problem, we expanded the test set by
adding new questions about translations with the se-
rious errors.
Sentences whose average grades were three or
less for fluency and adequacy for the translation re-
sults of the five MT systems were selected for the
expansion. Besides them, sentences whose average
grades were more than three for fluency and ade-
quacy for the translation results of the five MT sys-
tems were selected when a majority of evaluation
results based on yes/no questions about the transla-
tions of the five MT systems were no. The number
of selected sentences was 150. The expansion was
manually performed using the following steps.
1. Serious translation errors are extracted from the
MT results.
2. For each extracted error, questions strongly re-
lated to the error are searched for in the test set.
If related questions are found, the same types
of questions are generated for the selected sen-
tence, and the same ID as that of the related
question is assigned to each generated question.
Otherwise, questions are newly generated, and
a new ID is assigned to each generated ques-
tion.
3. Each MT result is evaluated according to each
added question.
Eventually, one or more questions were assigned to
each selected sentence in the test set. Among the 150

selected sentences, questions were newly assigned
to 103 sentences. The number of added questions
was 148. The maximum number of questions added
to a sentence was five. After expanding the test set,
the correlation coefficients between the subjective
evaluations based on yes/no questions and based on
fluency and adequacy increased from 0.48 to 0.51
for fluency and from 0.63 to 0.66 for adequacy. The
differences between the correlation coefficients ob-
tained before and after the expansion are statistically
significant at the 5% or less significance level for
adequacy. These results indicate that the expansion
of the test set significantly improves the correlation
between the subjective evaluations based on yes/no
questions and based on adequacy. When two or
more questions were assigned to a test-set sentence,
the subjective evaluation based on the questions was
decided by the majority answer. The majority an-
swers, yes and no, were numerically transformed
into 1 and ?1. Ties between yes and no were trans-
formed into 0. Examples of added questions and
the subjective evaluations based on the questions are
shown in Tables 2 and 3.
3 Automatic Evaluation of Machine
Translation Based on Rate of
Accomplishment of Sub-goals
3.1 A New Measure for Evaluating Machine
Translation Quality
The JEIDA test set was not designed for auto-
matic evaluation but for human subjective evalua-
tion. However, a measure for automatic MT evalu-
ation that strongly correlates fluency and adequacy
is likely to be established because the subjective
evaluation based on yes/no questions has a rela-
tively strong correlation with the subjective evalua-
tion based on fluency and adequacy, as mentioned in
Section 2. In this section, we describe a method for
automatically evaluating MT quality by predicting
an answer to each yes/no question and using those
answers.
Hereafter, we assume that each yes/no question is
defined as a sub-goal that a given translation should
satisfy and that the sub-goal is accomplished if the
answer to the corresponding yes/no question to the
sub-goal is yes. We also assume that the sub-goal
is unaccomplished if the answer is no. A new eval-
uation score, A, is defined based on a multiple lin-
36
Table 4: Examples of Patterns.
Sample sentence She lived there by herself.
Question Is ?by herself? translated as ?hitori de??
Pattern The answer is yes if the pattern [hitori dake de|hitori kiri de |tandoku de|tanshin de] is included in a
translation. Otherwise, the answer is no.
Sample sentence They speak English in New Zealand.
Question The personal pronoun ?they? is omitted in a translation like ?nyuujiilando de wa eigo wo hanasu??
Pattern The answer is yes if the pattern [karera wa|sore ra wa] is not included in a translation. Otherwise, the
answer is no.
ear regression model as follows using the rate of ac-
complishment of the sub-goals and the similarities
between a given translation and its reference trans-
lation. The best-fitted line for the observed data is
calculated by the method of least-squares (Draper
and Smith, 1981).

Here, the term Q

corresponds to the rate of accom-

?
Q

is a weight for the rate of accomplishment. The
term Q

Q

is a
weight for the rate of unaccomplishment. The value
n indicates the number of types of sub-goals. The
term ?

is constant.
The term S
i
indicates a similarity between a trans-
lated sentence and its reference translation, and ?
S
i
is a weight for the similarity. Many methods for cal-
culating the similarity have been proposed (Niessen
et al, 2000; Akiba et al, 2001; Papineni et al, 2002;
NIST, 2002; Leusch et al, 2003; Turian et al, 2003;
Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004;
Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gimen?ez et al, 2005).
In our research, 23 scores, namely BLEU (Papineni
et al, 2002) with maximum n-gram lengths of 1, 2,
3, and 4, NIST (NIST, 2002) with maximum n-gram
lengths of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, GTM (Turian et al, 2003)
with exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, METEOR (ex-
act) (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), WER (Niessen et
al., 2000), PER (Leusch et al, 2003), and ROUGE
(Lin, 2004) with n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and
4 variants (LCS, S?, SU?, W-1.2), were used to cal-
culate each similarity S
i
. Therefore, the value of m
in Eq. (1) was 23. Japanese word segmentation was
performed by using JUMAN 4 in our experiments.
As you can see, the definition of our new measure
is based on a combination of an evaluation measure
focusing on local information and that focusing on
global information.
3.2 Automatic Estimation of Rate of
Accomplishment of Sub-goals
The rate of accomplishment of sub-goals is esti-
mated by determining the answer to each question
as yes or no. This section describes a method based
on simple patterns for determining the answers.
An answer to each question is automatically de-
termined by checking whether patterns are included
in a translation or not. The patterns are constructed
for each question. All of the patterns are expressed
in hiragana characters. Before applying the pat-
terns to a given translation, the translation is trans-
formed into hiragana characters, and all punctuation
is eliminated. The transformation to hiragana char-
acters was performed by using JUMAN in our ex-
periments.
Test-set sentences, the questions assigned to
them, and the patterns constructed for the questions
are shown in Table 4. In the patterns, the symbol ?|?
represents ?OR?.
3.3 Automatic Sub-goal Generation and
Automatic Estimation of Rate of
Accomplishment of Sub-goals
We found that expressions important for maintain-
ing a high translation quality were often commonly
4http://www.kc.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nl-resource/juman.html
37
included in the reference translations for each test-
set sentence. We also found that the expression was
also related to the yes/no question assigned to the
test-set sentence. Therefore, we automatically gen-
erate yes/no questions in the following steps.
1. For each test-set sentence, a set of words com-
monly appearing in the reference translations
are extracted.
2. For each combination of n words in the set
of words extracted in the first step, skip word
n-grams commonly appearing in the reference
translations in the same word order are selected
as a set of common skip word n-grams.
3. For each test-set sentence, the sub-goal is de-
fined as the yes/no question ?Are all of the com-
mon skip word n-grams included in the transla-
tion??
If no common skip word n-grams are found, the
yes/no question is not generated. The answer to the
yes/no question is determined to be yes if all of the
common skip word n-grams are included in a trans-
lation. Otherwise, the answer is determined to be
no.
This scheme assigns greater weight to important
phrases that should be included in the translation to
maintain a high translation quality. Our observation
is that those important phrases are often common
between human translations. A similar scheme was
proposed by Babych and Hartley (Babych and Hart-
ley, 2004) for BLEU. In their scheme, greater weight
is assigned to components that are salient through-
out the document. Therefore, their scheme focuses
on global context while our scheme focuses on local
context. We believe that the two schemes are com-
plementary to each other.
4 Experiments and Discussion
In our experiments, the translation results of three
MT systems and their subjective evaluation results
were used as a development set for constructing the
patterns described in Section 3.2 and for tuning the
parameters ?

, and ?

in Eq. (1). The
translations and evaluation results of the remaining
two MT systems were used as an evaluation set for
testing.
In the development set, each test-set sentence has
at least one question, at least one reference transla-
tion, three MT results, and subjective evaluation re-
sults of the three MT results. The patterns for deter-
mining yes/no answers were manually constructed
for the questions assigned to the 769 test-set sen-
tences. There were 917 questions assigned to them.
Among them, the patterns could be constructed for
898 questions assigned to 767 test-set sentences.
The remaining 19 questions were skipped because
making simple patterns as described in Section 3.2
was difficult; for example, one of the questions
was ?Is the whole sentence translated into one sen-
tence??. The yes/no answer determination accura-
cies obtained by using the patterns are shown in Ta-
ble 5.

We investigated the correlation between the eval-
uation score, A in Eq. (1) and the subjective eval-
uations, fluency and adequacy, for the 769 test-set
sentences. First, to maximize the correlation coeffi-

As shown in Table 6, 7, and 8, our methods signif-
icantly outperform the conventional methods from
literature. Note that WER outperformed other indi-
vidual measures like BLEU and NIST in our exper-
iments, and the combination of existing automatic
evaluation methods from the literature outperformed
individual lexical similarity measures by themselves
in almost all cases. The differences between the
correlation coefficients obtained using our method
and the conventional methods are statistically sig-
nificant at the 5% or less significance level for flu-
ency and adequacy, even if the number of reference
translations increases, except in three cases shown
in Table 7 and 8. This indicates that considering
the rate of accomplishment of sub-goals to automat-
ically evaluate the quality of each translation is use-
ful, especially when the number of reference trans-
lations is small.
The differences between the correlation coeffi-
cients obtained using two automatic methods are not
significant. These results indicate that we can reduce
the development cost for constructing sub-goals.
However, there are still significant gaps between the
correlation coefficients obtained using a fully auto-
matic method and upper bounds. These gaps indi-
cate that we need further improvement in automatic
sub-goal generation and automatic estimation of rate
of accomplishment of sub-goals, which is our future
work.
Human judgments of adequacy and fluency are
known to be noisy, with varying levels of intercoder
agreement. Recent work has tended to apply cross-
judge normalization to address this issue (Blatz et
al., 2003). We would like to evaluate against the
normalized data in the future.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
We demonstrated that the quality of a translated sen-
tence can be evaluated more appropriately than by
using conventional methods. That was demonstrated
by constructing a test set where the conditions that
should be satisfied to maintain a high translation
quality are assigned to each test-set sentence in the
form of a question, by developing a system that de-
termines an answer to each question, and by com-
bining a measure based on the questions and con-
ventional measures. We also presented a method for
automatically generating sub-goals in the form of
yes/no questions and estimating the rate of accom-
plishment of the sub-goals. Promising results were
obtained.
In the near future, we would like to expand the
test set to improve the upper bound obtained by
our method. We are also planning to expand the
method and improve the accuracy of the automatic
sub-goal generation and determination of the rate of
accomplishment of sub-goals. The sub-goals of a
given sentence should be generated by considering
the complexity of the sentence and the alignment in-
formation between the original source-language sen-
tence and its translation. Further advanced genera-
tion and estimation would give us information about
the erroneous parts of MT results and their quality.
We believe that future research would allow us to
develop high-quality MT systems by tuning the sys-
tem parameters based on the automatic MT evalua-
tion measures.
