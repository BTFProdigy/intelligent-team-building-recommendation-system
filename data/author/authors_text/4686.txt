Abstract
Traditionally, domain ontologies are created manually, based on human experts?
views on the classes and relations of the domain at hand. We present ongoing
work on two approaches to the automatic construction of ontologies from a flat
database of records, and compare them to a manually constructed ontology. The
latter CIDOC-CRM ontology focusses on the organisation of classes and relations.
In contrast, the first automatic method, based on machine learning, focuses on the
mutual predictiveness between classes, while the second automatic method, created
with the aid of Wikipedia, stresses meaningful relations between classes. The three
ontologies show little overlap; their differences illustrate that a different focus during
ontology construction can lead to radically different ontologies. We discuss the
implications of these differences, and argue that the two alternative ontologies may
be useful in higher-level information systems such as search engines.
1 Introduction
Ontologies are explicit conceptualisations of domains. A vast amount of work on on-
tologies in the knowledge representation field has focussed on their use in facilitating
knowledge sharing between knowledge-based systems, and in the interaction between
such systems and human users [3]. Ontologies can for instance offer help in visualis-
ing the domain for users, and hence improve their understanding of the information, or
they can be employed to enhance searching in domain data through for instance query
expansion or faceted navigation.
It is conceivable to have different ontologies for a single domain. Although developers
of traditional ontologies tend to stress that ?true? ontologies are function-independent,
in a more practical sense it is possible to design ontologies with a particular functionality
in mind, such as an embedding in an information system. This may influence design
choices. For certain tasks, a more formal and elaborate ontology is required, whereas
for other tasks a simpler conceptualisation of the domain that only contains the most
important classes and relations may suffice. Such considerations may influence choices
when designing an ontology, as ontology construction is an expensive task, traditionally
requiring knowledge from and formalisation by or with domain experts.
282
In the past decade, an increasing amount of work is invested in the development of
support systems for automatic or semi-automatic ontology construction, with workshops
devoted to this topic at several AI conferences such as ECAI and IJCAI [1]. In this study,
three ontologies for a single domain are presented. The scenario is that at the outset we
have a database of records, each describing an instance of an object ? in our case study,
a zoological specimen in a natural history collection, described by several textual fields.
The database column labels can serve as starting points for naming the class nodes in
our ontology. The task then is to find out how these classes are related to each other; we
let two data-driven methods induce these relations. As a gold standard for comparing
our two automatic ontology construction methods, we also have a manually designed
ontology for the domain.
2 Three Ontologies
The database used as a starting point in this paper describes key characteristics of
reptile and amphibian (R&A) specimens present in the collection of the Dutch National
Museum for Natural History
1
, using mostly textual database fields. It is constructed
manually, and contains 16,870 records in 39 columns. Most values are limited to one
or a few words, some fields contain longer stretches of text, for instance describing the
climatological circumstances or the location at which a specimen was found.
2.1 A Hierarchical Ontology
As a baseline, an ontology was manually constructed following the CIDOC-CRM concep-
tual model standards [2] (henceforth: CIDOC). It is relatively straightforward to match
each column (representing a salient domain concept) and its relevant relations from the
R&A database to a class in CIDOC. The prime goal of the CIDOC reference ontology
is to offer a framework to model the organisation of processes and entities within a
cultural heritage collection. This goal leads to a richness in hierarchical relations, ex-
pressing mainly hyponymy and meronymy relations. In Figure 2.3, these relations are
indicated by the uninterrupted lines.
2.2 A Mutual Predictiveness Ontology
The second ontology is based on the application of machine learning methods to the R&A
database. It aims to reflect the predictability of values in one database column on the
basis of values in other columns. In ontological terms: knowing the values of certain fields
in one instance, the values of certain other fields may be predicted accurately. Indeed, we
show by performing machine learning experiments that in our database certain columns
are conditionally dependent on each other. For instance, if the ?Province? field of a
record has the value West Java, most machine learning methods can be trained to induce
that the value in the ?Country? field must be Indonesia given enough training samples
1

283
of database records. Such conditional dependencies can be directly used for our current
goal: establishing relations between classes. When a machine learning algorithm (such as
a machine learning algorithm adopting an explicit feature selection preprocessing step)
actively selects a database column to predict the values of another column, we assume
that in the ontology the class nodes belonging to the two database fields are connected
by a directed ?predictiveness? relation. In Figure 2.3, the dotted lines represent the
relations between a class and its single-most predictive class.
2.3 A Hybrid Ontology
The second data-driven ontology proposed here again utilises the R&A database, as
well as a human-made semantic network resource, in order to look for possible relations
between the classes. The database is a handy starting point, as each record is already
a structured piece of information carrying instances of paired values. These pairs are
subsequently looked up in the external semantic network resource, to verify whether this
resource knows the particular relation between this pair ? which may in turn be a good
candidate label for the relation between the pairs? classes.
To this purpose we chose to use the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia
2
. Wikipedia?s
link structure can be considered a semantic network, as the guidelines for contributors
state that links from the page of one concept to another should only be added when they
are meaningfully related [4]. We find candidate relation labels between database columns
by discovering relations, i.e. linguistic predicates between values from these columns co-
occurring within the limits of a sentence, given that their Wikipedia pages are linked.
The obtained verb phrases are ranked by frequency and annotated by human evaluators.
In Figure 2.3 the relations in this hybrid ontology are indicated by the dashed lines. For
the sake of clarity not all concepts within the domain are shown in the graph and relation
labels are also excluded.

3 Discussion
The three ontologies presented in the previous section are remarkably different from each
other; their overlap is minimal. This can only be attributed to the different building
principles of the three ontologies.
In the machine-learning-based ontology, a relation signifies a conditional dependency
relation between two classes. Interestingly, this method uncovers relations between
classes of radically different entity types (such as between collectors and locations) that
are yet meaningful in the domain. Conditional dependence can also be a guideline for
data storage, as it indicates which information is redundant, and can thus be compressed
or stored optimally.
The hybrid ontology offers a middle ground between the machine learning and
CIDOC ontologies. It is created via analysing human-generated content in an exter-
nal semantic resource, namely Wikipedia. The obtained relations originate from a pool
of possible rankings by human judges, therefore we argue that this ontology represents
relations in the natural history domain that are fairly accepted. Compared to the hy-
brid ontology, the CIDOC ontology is rather sparse; for instance, between the biological
taxon concepts it strictly encodes the hypernym relations between parent and child
nodes, whereas the hybrid ontology tends to link everything that is somehow related
according to encyclopaedic evidence.
To conclude, we believe the hybrid approach is still crude, but it does produce possible
links between domain concepts attested in an external encyclopeadic resource, while
requiring little effort in development. We also believe that conditional dependence, as
detectable through machine learning, should be considered as a ground for establishing
relations between concepts. While the final decision should be left to human experts,
both methods may serve as useful ontology expansion proposal methods.

Towards Acquisition of Taxonomic Inference

Abstract
On a pilot corpus of Dutch medical encyclopedia texts, we focus
on the mechanism of taxonomic inference that involves the extraction
of co-hyponym terms, and the taxonomic or domain-specific lexico-
semantic relation in the form of a textual hypothesis, which coordinates
these. An initial set of inference elements can be acquired by syntactic
and semantic alignment, additionally driven by document structure.
From the terms and the related hypothesis we can harvest lexical pat-
terns, which are linked to annotated domain concepts. The aim of the
process is to learn inference patterns and apply the system to short
as well as unstructured documents where fewer or no discourse-level
cues are available, in order to acquire new co-hyponyms linked to their
coordinating term via a specified relation.
1 Introduction
It is shown in several studies that thematic coherence has an impact on doc-
ument structure, hence identifying discourse relations can facilitate access to
semantic content; for an overview of relevant issues in the field of discourse
parsing see [2]. In the case of stylistically guided documents, pressure for
brevity and clarity is superimposed on the creative interplay between form
and factual content of narration. An encyclopedia entry often provides a
definition of an entity of which several subtypes exist; these need to be sep-
arately treated in the entry. However, the use of tables, charts, bulleted
lists and other visual means that are inherently well suited for representing
hierarchically structured data is traditionally not favourable in dominantly
textual media that need to remedy this by providing lexical, syntactic, and
structural cues to the reader.
291
Linguistic constructions that are employed to convey structured informa-
tion can be macro-propositions, for example ?pre-announcements? of certain
subtopics that are going to be addressed in the document, such as There ex-
ists an acute and a chronic form of gallbladder disease, or recurring lexical
and syntactic elements (?chains?) across the passages treating the subtopics,
as in the excerpt from the encyclopedia entry on Digestive tract:
The first organ is the tongue which is only present in the phylum Chordata.
The second organ is the esophagus. ... The third organ is the stomach. ...
Such constructions serve to alleviate the readers? cognitive load required to
make semantic inference about hierarchical and semantic relations (e.g., that
tongue, esophagus, and stomach are co-hyponyms of the hypernym digestive
tract, and all three are organs of it). Most importantly, many encyclopedia
articles treating co-hyponyms do not feature any of these linguistic means,
but operate by activating real-world knowledge, thus it is an empirical re-
search issue how to trace back such information.
While extracting hyponym-hypernym pairs is a popular topic in the lit-
erature, initiated by the seminal paper of [1], identifying specific types of
hypernymy relations has only been addressed for a limited set of general
concepts [3]. We target the detection of domain-specific lexio-semantic rela-
tions (sometimes broadly called ?associative?) together with traditional hy-
pernymy and meronymy relations, by modelling it as a taxonomy inference
phenomenon. Representing these relations between domain-specific entities
can be a first step in the construction of an ontological model, which is an
important asset of knowledge-based applications.
Taxonomy inference consists of an n-tuple of terms, two or more of them
linked by a coordinate relation, where each of these is linked by either hyper-
nymy or associative relation to a common coordinating term. The relation
between mother and child node is governed by a certain semantic property
of the parent node, which is in the case of meronymy and hypernymy best
expressed by a noun (e.g. in the medical domain method, phase, form),
or in the case of domain-specific relatedness by a verb (such as occurs in or
attacks). The coordinating relation can typically be induced from factual do-
main knowledge but often remains implicit in the text: while it is non-trivial
to retrieve it, especially for the co-hyponymic terms, based on a single docu-
ment and/or lexico-semantic resources, it is an extremely productive general
mechanism of cognitive inference.
292
2 Data
Our pilot corpus comprises 108 entries from the Dutch Spectrum Medical
Encyclopedia
1
, these were obtained based on identifying repetitive occur-
rences of 13 topic labels manually assigned to layout-based sections (treatment,
symptoms, cause, etc.) within an entry. Token-level annotation was also
manual, using 12 coarse-grained domain concepts such as body part, duration,
disease, disease symptom, microorganism, method of diagnosis.
We illustrate the complexity of phenomena underlying taxonomy infer-
ence by the following entry (the document and section titles are set in italics).
Jaundice, or icterus, is a condition whereby a yellowish discoloration of the
skin, the mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes appears. This is caused
by increased levels of the gall pigment bilirubin in the blood serum. ...
Adults
Adults can develop jaundice by three means. By an interruption to the
drainage of bile in the biliary system (e.g. due to a gallstone or a tumor).
... By diseases of the liver (e.g. hepatitis). The liver?s ability to metabolise
and excrete bilirubin is reduced, leading to a buildup in the blood. ... By
an increased rate of bilirubine production. ...
Babies
Babies can develop a sort of jaundice (icterus neonatorum) shortly after
birth as a consequence of relatively increased breakdown of red blood cells
... .
In this entry, the onsets of the two subsections exhibit some syntactic
and lexical parallelism; after establishing their similarity, our aim is to lo-
cate the relation between the two main terms (adults and babies) in these
sections. Spotting lexical overlap and using wildcards yields the expression
?X can develop Y?, and we hypothesise that the verb phrase instantiates the
domain-specific lexico-semantic relation shared by the coordinate terms in
connection to the term jaundice.
Note that this entry does not contain a separate passage of text that
can be designated as the hypothesis of the above relation, thus we fall back
on the lexical string (i.e., the VP) when extracting the relation. Also note
that taxonomy inference can be embedded: we observe syntactic similarity
among three sentences in the Adults subsection. Their coordinating hyper-
nymy relation is literally expressed by the very first sentence of the section,
yielding the pattern ?X can develop Y by [NUM] means?, this sentence is
1
http://www.winklerprins.com/linkpages/Algemenenaslag.html
293
thus regarded as the inference hypothesis of the three sentences featuring
the overlapping onsets.
3 Goals and Evaluation
Our goal is to investigate if we can bootstrap the linking of coordinate terms
via a specific type of relation, inferrable from the given document collection.
Next to measuring the utility of sentence alignment based on standard, au-
tomatically obtained syntactic (dependency, part-of-speech) and semantic
(cosine, querying lexical semantic databases) similarity cues as well as dis-
course markers (anaphore) for this task, our focus is on the role lexical
patterns can play in this process. We test the impact of two factors on har-
vesting lexical patterns as inference elements: (a) syntactic and semantic
segmentation: enriching these with dependency as well as semantic roles,
and (b) clustering the patterns according to domain concepts.
The results are manually evaluated, preparing training data for further
bootstrapping. The system is eventually applied to the full IMIX corpus of
Dutch medical encyclopedia texts
2
to process single-section (i.e., unstruc-
tured) documents and automatically detect and link coordinate terms by
domain-specific relations in these new documents. The obtained terms are
matched to available Dutch terminological resources in the medical domain
