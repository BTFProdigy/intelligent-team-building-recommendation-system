Abstract
This paper describes the annotation process
and linguistic properties of the Persian syn-
tactic dependency treebank. The treebank
consists of approximately 30,000 sentences
annotated with syntactic roles in addition to
morpho-syntactic features. One of the unique
features of this treebank is that there are al-
most 4800 distinct verb lemmas in its sen-
tences making it a valuable resource for ed-
ucational goals. The treebank is constructed
with a bootstrapping approach by means of
available tagging and parsing tools and man-
ually correcting the annotations. The data is
splitted into standard train, development and
test set in the CoNLL dependency format and
is freely available to researchers.
1 Introduction1
The process of manually annotating linguistic data
from a huge amount of naturally occuring texts is a
very expensive and time consuming task. Due to the
recent success of machine learning methods and the
rapid growth of available electronic texts, language
processing tasks have been facilitated greatly. Con-
sidering the value of annotated data, a great deal of
budget has been allotted to creating such data.
Among all linguistic datasets, treebanks play an
important role in the natural language processing
tasks especially in parsing because of its applica-

tions in tasks such as machine translation. Depen-
dency treebanks are collections of sentences with
their corresponding dependency trees. In the last
decade, many dependency treebanks have been de-
veloped for a large number of languages. There are
at least 29 languages for which at least one depen-
dency treebank is available (Zeman et al, 2012).
Dependency trees are much more similar to the hu-
man understanding of language and can easily rep-
resent the free word-order nature of syntactic roles
in sentences (Ku?bler et al, 2009).
Persian is a language with about 110 million
speakers all over the world (Windfuhr, 2009), yet in
terms of the availability of teaching materials and
annotated data for text processing, it is undoubt-
edly a low-resourced language. The need for more
language teaching materials together with an ever-
increasing need for Persian-language data process-
ing has been the incentive for the inception of our
project which has defined the development of the
syntactic treebank of Persian as its ultimate aim. In
this paper, we review the process of creating the Per-
sian syntactic treebank based on dependency gram-
mar. In this treebank, approximately 30,000 sen-
tences from contemporary Persian-language texts
are manually tokenized and annotated at morpholog-
ical and syntactic levels. One valuable aspect of the
treebank is its containment of near 5000 distinct verb
lemmas in its sentences making it a good resource
for educational goals. The dataset is developed af-
ter the creation of the syntactic valency lexicon of
Persian verbs (Rasooli et al, 2011c). This treebank
is developed with a bootstrapping approach by au-
tomatically building dependency trees based on the

2 Persian Language Processing Challenges
Persian is an Indo-European language that is writ-
ten in Arabic script. There are lots of problems
in its orthography such as encoding problems, hid-
den diacritics and writing standards (Kashefi et al,
2010). A number of challenges such as the free or-

der of words, the existence of colloquial texts, the
pro-drop nature of the Persian language and its com-
plex inflections (Shamsfard, 2011) in addition to the
lack of efficient annotated linguistic data have made
the processing of Persian texts very difficult; e.g.
there are more than 100 conjugates and 2800 de-
clensions for some word forms in Persian (Rasooli
et al, 2011b), some words in the Persian language
do not have a clear word category (i.e. the lexical
category ?mismatch?) (Karimi-Doostan, 2011a) and
many compound verbs (complex predicates) can be
separable (i.e. the non-verbal element may be sepa-
rated from the verbal element by one or more other
words) (Karimi-Doostan, 2011b).
After the development of the Bijankhan corpus
(Bijankhan, 2004) with the annotation of word cat-
egories, other kinds of datasets have been created
to address the need for Persian language process-
ing. Among them, a Persian parser based on link
grammar (Dehdari and Lonsdale, 2008), a compu-
tational grammar based on GPSG (Bahrani et al,
2011), syntactic treebank based on HPSG (Ghay-
oomi, 2012) and Uppsala dependency treebank (Ser-
aji et al, 2012) are the efforts to satisfy the need for

syntactic processing in the Persian language.

The NVE is a relation between a light verb and its

the nonverbal element is not near the light verb, but
also it is inflected for plurality (i.e. speakings).
