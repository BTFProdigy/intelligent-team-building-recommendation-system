Abstract 
When PRC was founded on mainland China and the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the 
relation between mainland China and Taiwan became a classical Cold War instance. Neither 
travel, visit, nor correspondences were allowed between the people until 1987, when 
government on both sides started to allow small number of Taiwan people with relatives in 
China to return to visit through a third location. Although the thawing eventually lead to 
frequent exchanges, direct travel links, and close commercial ties between Taiwan and 
mainland China today, 38 years of total isolation from each other did allow the language use to 
develop into different varieties, which have become a popular topic for mainly lexical studies 
(e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang & Li, 1996). Grammatical difference of these two variants, 
however, was not well studied beyond anecdotal observation, partly because the near identity 
of their grammatical systems. This paper focuses on light verb variations in Mainland and 
Taiwan variants and finds that the light verbs of these two variants indeed show distributional 
tendencies. Light verbs are chosen for two reasons: first, they are semantically bleached hence 
more susceptible to changes and variations. Second, the classification of light verbs is a 
challenging topic in NLP. We hope our study will contribute to the study of light verbs in 
Chinese in general. The data adopted for this study was a comparable corpus extracted from 
Chinese Gigaword Corpus and manually annotated with contextual features that may 
contribute to light verb variations. A multivariate analysis was conducted to show that for each 
light verb there is at least one context where the two variants show differences in tendencies 
(usually the presence/absence of a tendency rather than contrasting tendencies) and can be 
differentiated. In addition, we carried out a K-Means clustering analysis for the variations and 
the results are consistent with the multivariate analysis, i.e. the light verbs in Mainland and 
Taiwan indeed have variations and the variations can be successfully differentiated. 
1 Introduction: Language Variations in the Chinese Context 
Commonly dichotomy of language and dialect is not easily maintained in the context of Chinese 
language(s). Cantonese, Min, Hakka, and Wu are traditionally referred to as dialects of Chinese but 
are mutually unintelligible. However, they do share a common writing system and literary and textual 
tradition, which allows speakers to have a shared linguistic identity. To overcome the mutual 
unintelligibility problem, a variant of Northern Mandarin Chinese, is designated as the common 
language about a hundred years ago (called ??? Putonghua ?common language? in Mainland 
China, and ??  Guoyu ?national language? in Taiwan). Referred to as Mandarin or Mandarin 
Chinese, or simply Chinese nowadays, this is the one of the most commonly learned first or second 
languages in the world now. However, not unlike English, with the fast globalization of the Chinese 
language, both the term ?World Chineses? and the recognition that there are different variants of 
Chinese emerged. In this paper, we studied two of the most important variants of Chinese, Mainland 
Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin.

1.1 Variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin: Previous studies 
The lexical differences between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin have been the focus of research in 
Chinese Linguistics in the recent years. A number of studies were carried out on lexical variations 
between these two variants of Mandarin Chinese, including variations in the meanings of the same 
word or using different words to express the same meaning (e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang,1996). 
Some dictionaries also list the lexical differences between Mainland Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin 
(e.g., Qiu, 1990; Wei & Sheng, 2000).  
By contrast, only a few of such studies were corpus driven (e.g. Hong and Huang 2008, 2013; 
Huang and Lin, 2013), and even few studies have been done on the grammatical variations of 
Mainland and Taiwan Chinese. Huang et al. (2013), the only such study based on comparable corpora 
so far, suggested that the subtlety of the underlining grammatical variations of these two dialectal 
variants at early stage of divergence may have contributed to the challenge as well as scarcity of 
previous studies.  
1.2 Light Verbs in Light Verb Variations 
The study of English light verb constructions (LVCs) (e.g., take a look, make an offer) has been an 
important topic in linguistics (Jespersen, 1965; Butt and Geuder, 2003; among others) as well as in 
Computational Linguistics (Tu and Dan, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2010; among others). 
Identification of LVCs is a fundamental crucial task for Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
applications, such as information retrieval and machine translation. For example, Tu and Dan (2011) 
proposed a supervised learning system to automatically identify English LVCs by training with groups 
of contextual or statistical features. Nagy et al. (2013) introduced a system that enables the full 
coverage identification of English LVCs in running context by using a machine leaning approach.  
However, little work has been done to identify Chinese LVCs, especially between different 
variants of Chinese (cf. Hwang et al., 2010). Chinese LVCs are similar to English LVCs in the sense 
that the light verb itself is semantically bleached and does not contain any eventive or contentive 
information, so the predicative information of the construction mainly comes from the complement 
taken by the light verb (e.g., Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982). For instance, ?? jinxing originally 
meant ?move forward/proceed?, but in an LVC such as???? jinxing taolun proceed discuss ?to 
discuss?, ?? jinxing only contributes aspectual information whereas the core meaning of the LVC 
comes from the complement ?? taolun ?discuss?. Chinese also differs from English in that many of 
the Chinese light verbs have similar usages and thus are often interchangeable, e.g., all the five light 
verbs ?? congshi, ? gao, ?? jiayi, ?? jinxing, and ? zuo can take ?? yanjiu ?do research? 
as their complement and form a LVC. But Huang et al. (2013) also observed that differences in 
collocation constraints can sometimes be found between different variants of Mandarin Chinese. For 
instance, constructions like ???? jinxing tou-piao proceed cast-ticket ?to cast votes?, where the 
complement is in the V(erb)-O(bject) form, usually can only be found in Taiwan Mandarin. Hence, 
Chinese LVCs are challenging for both linguistic studies and computational applications in two 
aspects: (a) to identify collocation constraints of the different light verbs in order to automatically 
classify and predict their uses in context, and (b) to identify the collocation constraints of the same 
light verb in order to differentiate and predict the two Chinese variants based on the use of such light 
verbs. The first issue has been explored in Lin et al. (2014): by analyzing Mainland and Taiwan 
Mandarin data extracted from comparable corpora with statistical and machine learning approaches, 
the authors find the five light verbs?? congshi, ? gao, ?? jiayi, ?? jinxing, and ? zuo can 
be reliably differentiated from each other in each variety. But to the best of our knowledge, there has 
been no previous computational study on modeling the light verb variations, or other syntactic 
variations of Chinese dialects or variants of the same dialect. Therefore, this paper builds on the study 
of Lin et al. (2014) and will adopt a comparable corpus driven approach to model light verb variations 
in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. 
2 Data and annotation 
Our study focuses on five light verbs, ?? jiayi, ?? jinxing, ?? congshi, ? gao and ? zuo 
(these words literally meant ?proceed?, ?inflict?, ?engage?, ?do?, and ?do? respectively). These five are 
2
chosen for two reasons. First, they are the most frequently used light verbs in Mandarin Chinese (Diao, 
2004); second, although the definition of Chinese light verbs is still debatable, these five are 
considered the most typical light verbs in most previous studies.   
The data for this study was extracted from the Annotated Chinese Gigaword Corpus (Huang, 2009) 
maintained by LDC which contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, consisting of 700 million 
characters from Taiwan Central News Agency (CNA) and 400 million characters from Mainland 
Xinhua News Agency (XNA). For each of the five light verbs, 400 sentences were randomly selected, 
half from the Mainland XNA corpus and the other half from the Taiwan CNA Corpus, which results in 
2,000 sentences in total.  
Previous studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 2013; among others) have 
proposed several syntactic and semantic features to compare and identify the similarities and 
differences among light verbs. For example, while Taiwan ?? congshi can take informal or 
semantically negative event complements such as ??? xingjiaoyi ?sexual trade?, Mainland ?? 
congshi is rarely found with such complements (Huang et al. 2013). 
In our study, we selected 11 features covering both syntactic and semantic features which may help 
to identify light verb variations, as in Table 1. All 2,000 sentences with light verbs were manually 
annotated with the 11 features. The annotator is a trained expert on Chinese linguistics. All ambiguous 
cases were discussed with another two experts in order to reach an agreement (the features and 
annotation were the same with Lin et al. (2014)). 
 
3 Modelling and Predicting Two Variants 
We carried out both a multivariate analysis and machine learning algorithm to explore the possible 
differences existing between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin light verbs. Our analysis shows that for 
each light verb, there is at least one context where the two variants of Mandarin show differences in 
usage tendencies and thus can be differentiated, although the differences more often lie in the 
presence/absence of a tendency rather than complementary distribution.   
3.1 Multivariate Analysis of Light Verb Variations 
As introduced in Section 1, the five or some of the five light verbs sometimes can be interchangeably 
used in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. This indicates that the interchangeable light verbs share 
some features. In other words, it is unlikely that a particular feature is preferred by only one light verb 
and thus differentiates the verb from the others. This is also proved in Lin et al. (2014). For instance, 
their study finds both Mainland and Taiwan ?? congshi and ? gao significantly prefer nominal 
complements (POS.N). Therefore, to better explore the light verb differences in the two variants, we 
adopt a multivariate analysis for this study.  
The multivariate analysis we used is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe 2008, cf. Han et al. 
2013, Bresnan et al. 2007), and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumous 
package in R (Arppe 2008). The polytomous logistic regression is an extension of standard logistic 
regression; it calculates the odds of the occurrence of a particular light verb when a particular feature 
is present, with all other features being equal (Arppe, 2008). In addition, it also allows for 
simultaneous estimation of the occurrence probability of all the five light verbs. 
Before we discuss the light verb variations based on multivariate analysis, we will show that the 
polytomous multivariate model adopted is reliable for our study. Table 2 presents the probability 
estimates of Mainland and Taiwan light verbs calculated by the model. The results indicate that the 
overall performance of the model is good: the most frequently predicted light verb (in each column) 
corresponds to the light verb that actually occurs in the data (in each row) (see the numbers in bold).  
In addition, the recall, precision, and F-measure of the estimates given in Table 3 show that each 
light verb in each variant can be successfully identified with a F-score better than chance (0.2), while 
the performance varies from light verb to light verb, which is thus consistent with the results in Lin et 
al. (2014). The only exception is ? gao in Mainland Mandarin, but the low F-score of ? gao (0.14) is 
consistent with the linguistic observation that this verb is rarely used as a light verb in Mainland 
Mandarin. More detailed information of the factors that can distinguish the five light verbs in each 
3
variant can also be found in Table 4. In the following of this section, we focus on the variations of

Table 4: Multivariate analysis of light verb variations in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. 
Table 4 summarizes the results estimated by the Polytomous multivaraite analysis. The numbers in 
the table are the odds for the features in favor of or against the occurrence of each light verb: odds 
larger than 1 indicate that the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly increased by the 
feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland ?? jiayi occurring is significantly increased by ARGSTRtwo 
(76.47: 1), followed by ACCOMPEVTyes (56.25: 1), VOCOMPyes (23.54: 1), PSYEVTyes (19.87: 
1); odds smaller than 1 indicate that the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly 
descreased by the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland ??  jinxing occurring is significantly 
decreased by ACCOMPEVTyse (0.1849: 1); in addition, ?inf? and ?1/inf? refer to odds larger than 
10,000 and smaller than 1/10,000 respectively, and non-significant odds (p-value < 0.05) are given in 
parentheses, regardless of the odds value.  
Table 4 finds that Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin indeed show some variations in each light verb. 
Furthermore, the variations of each light verb mainly lie in non-complementary distributional patterns. 
That is, as highlighted in dark grey colour in Table 4, the odds differences are more often between 
non-significance (odds in parentheses) and significance (odds larger or smaller than 1), rather than 
between significant preference (odds larger than 1) and significant dis-preference (odds smaller than 
1). In other words, the difference of a light verb in the two variants is more comparative, rather than 
5
contrastive.  This explains why the variations are not easily found by traditional linguistic studies. 
The following summarizes the key variations of each light verb.  
 
?? congshi 
?? congshi in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin has no feature significantly in its favor and it 
is significantly disfavored by ARGSTRtwo (taking two-argument complements, e.g., ?? yanjiu ?to 
research?) and INTEREVTyes (taking complements denoting interactive activities, e.g., ?? 
shangliang ?to discuss?). However, Taiwan ??  congshi is differentiated from Mainland ?? 
congshi in that the former is also disfavored by FOREVTyes (taking complements denoting formal 
events, e.g., ?? yanjiu ?to research?) and VOCOMPyes (taking complements in the form of V(erb)-
O(bject), e.g., ?? toupiao ?cast a vote?), whereas the latter is not. The finding that Taiwan ?? 
congshi is less likely to take formal event as its complement is consistent with that in Huang et al. 
(2013).  
 
? gao 
Both Mainland and Taiwan ? gao are significantly favored by ARGSTRzero (taking zero-argument 
complements, i.e. noun complement in this study). However, compared with Taiwan Mandarin, 
Mainland ? gao is more likely to take two-argument complements (ARGSTRtwo), but less likely to 
take complements denoting accomplishment events (ACCOMPEVTyes, e.g., ?? jiejue ?to solve?), 
and it is also disfavored by the aggregate of default variable values (i.e. the intercept, 0.02: 1).  
 
??  jiayi  
Both Mainland and Taiwan ? ?  jiayi are favored by the feature ACCOMPEVTyes 
(accomplishment complement such as ??  jiejue ?to solve?), but the chance of occurrence of 
Mainland ??  jiayi increases with the presence of two-argument complements (ARGSTRtwo), 
complements in VO form (VOCOMPyes), and complements denoting mental or phychological 
activities (PSYEVTyes, e.g., ?? fanxing ?to introspect?).  
 
?? jinxing 
Both Mainland and Taiwan ?? jinxing have INTEREVTyes (taking complements denoting 
interactive activities) and EVECOMPyes (allowing event complements in subject position, e.g., ??
???? huiyi jinxing shunli meeting procced smoothly ?The meeting proceeded smoothly?) in their 
favor. However, ??  jinxing in Mainland Mandarin is less likely to take accomplishment 
complements (ACCOMPEVTyes); whereas ?? jinxing in Taiwan Mandarin is more disfavored by 
ARGSTRzero, but more likely to take complements in VO form, which is also consistent with the 
findings in Huang et al. (2013).  
 
? zuo  
The occurrence of ? zuo in Mainland Mandarin is decreased by factors such as ARGSTRtwo, 
FOREVTyes, and INTEREVTyes, whereas the occurrence of ? zuo in Taiwan Mandarin is decreased 
by ACCOMPTEVTyes, but significantly increased by ASPle. It is obvious to linguists that ? zuo in 
both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are frequently found with the perfective marker ? le, but our 
analysis reveals that the affixation ? le to Taiwan ? zuo is much more frequent than that in Mainland.  
3.2 Clustering Analysis of Light Verb Variations 
We adopted a vector space model (VSM) to represent the use of light verbs. The features in Table 1 
could be expanded to 17 binary features. For example, ASP could be expanded into four binary 
features: ASP.le, ASP.zhe, ASP.guo, ASP.none. Each instance of a light verb in the corpus was 
represented by a vector with 17 dimensions. Each dimension stores the value of one of the 17 binary 
features determined by the context where the light verb is used.

ML 23 44 3 16 38 45 20 11 8 3 
Table 5: The distribution of data origin by the clustering result. 
Then we adopt a clustering algorithm K-Means to identify the variations of light verbs in Taiwan 
and Mainland Mandarin. The assumption is that the instances of a light verb will form different 
clusters in the hyperspace according to the distances among them. Each cluster reflects a special use of 
a light verb. For example, there could be one cluster, where all the instances take non-accomplishment 
event argument, e.g., ????/??/??  jiayi fenxi/ yanjiu/ pinglun inflict analyze/ research/ 
comment ?to analyze/ research/ comment?, etc.  
In this sense, if there are light verb variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, the light 
verbs will be distributed to two clusters, one with data mainly from Mainland Mandarin, whereas the 
other mainly from Taiwan Mandarin. Meanwhile, if a cluster contains much more data from one 
variant than the other, it indicates the usage of a light verb is mainly restricted to the variant with more 
data; or if a cluster contains data of similar amount from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, it 
indicates that the two variants share common usages regarding the light verbs. Therefore, for each 
light verb, all 400 examples from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are mixed together for the 
analysis.  
As the K-Means algorithm requires an input of the number N of the clusters, the selection of N is 
then an issue we need to consider. Remembering that the clusters reflect the use of a light verb rather 
than data origin, the selection of N should be based on the consideration of how many different uses a 
light verb may have. As there are 17 expanded binary features, the whole space of the values of the 
vectors is 217 = 128K. However, the number of different uses for a light verb should not be too large. 
There is no problem if N is set slightly larger than the real number of different uses of a light verb. For 
example, if there are 5 different uses for a light verb and we set N=6, then we can imagine that there 
may be two clusters that reflect the same use of the light verb. On the contrary, if N is set too small, all 
different uses will be mixed together. Then, the clustering result may not be able to show any 
interesting result we expected. In our experiments, we set N=10 for all the five light verbs. Especially, 
we use the WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) implementation of the simple K-Means for our experiments. The 
result is shown in Table 5. The key variations of each light verb are summarized as follows.  
 
?? congshi 
Cluster 5 shows that Mainland ?? congshi prefers to take complements denoting formal or 
official events in Mainland Mandarin. However, Taiwan ?? congshi does not show such preference 
as it can take both formal and informal events. Clusters 6 and 9 show that Taiwan ?? congshi can 
also take complements in VO form, e.g., ???? jinxing kaipiao proceed ballot counting ?to proceed 
with ballot counting?, but this is not preferred by Mainland ?? congshi. 
 
? gao 
Clusters 6 and 7 together show that the argument of Mainland ? gao can occur in the subject 
position in addition to the complement position, but such word order is rarely found in Taiwan data. 
Cluster 3 shows a possibility for Mainland ? gao to take arguments denoting events involving 
interactions of participants (e.g., ?? taolun ?to discuss?). In addition, Cluster 9 shows the possibility 
7
that Mainland? gao can take complements describing informal events, while the complements to 
Taiwan Mainland ? gao are more often formal events (especially political activities).  
 
?? jiayi 
Cluster 7 suggests Mainland ?? jiayi show a preference over complements denoting mental or 
psychological events. However, although Clusters 1 and 6 show some difference between Mainland 
and Taiwan ?? jiayi, our closer examination of the original data found that such differences actually 
do not reflect any variant-specific uses.  
 
?? jinxing 
Cluster 6 suggests that Mainland?? jinxing show a preference over the aspectual marker ? -le, 
but such preference is not seen in Taiwan ?? jinxing. Cluster 8 shows a preference by Taiwan??  
jinxing that it could take VO compound (e.g., ?? toupiao cast-ticket ?to vote?) as complements, 
while this rarely happens in Mainland. 
 
? zuo 
Clusters 1 and 3 show that in Mainland Mandarin, it is common for ? zuo to take the aspectual 
marker ? -le, but such use of ? zuo in Taiwan is not as common as in Mainland. 
 
To sum up, the results from the machine learning method are consistent with that from the 
multivariate statistical analysis in Section 3.1. Bringing together, we find that while the light verbs in 
Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin show similarities (as the speakers of these two regions can 
communicate without difficulty), there are indeed also variations in the two variants.   
4 Concluding Remarks 
Our study is the one of the first comparable corpus driven computational modeling studies on newly 
emergent language variants. The automatic identification of Mainland and Taiwan syntactic variations 
has very significant linguistic and computational implications. Linguistically, we showed that our 
comparable corpus driven statistical approach can identify comparative differences which are 
challenging for human analysis. The fact that newly emergent variants differ from each other 
comparatively rather than contrastively may also have important linguistics implications. In addition, 
by successfully differentiating these two variants based on their uses of light verbs, the result also 
suggests that variations among such newly emergent variants may arise from categories that are 
semantically highly bleached and tend to be/or have been grammaticalized. Computationally, the 
ability of machine learning approaches to differentiate Mainland and Taiwan variants of Mandarin 
Chinese potentially contributes to overcoming the challenge of automatic identification of subtle 
language/dialect variations among other light verbs, other lexical categories, as well as other 
languages/dialects.

Abstract 
Light verbs pose an a challenge in linguistics because of its syntactic and semantic versatility and  its 
unique distribution different from regular verbs with higher semantic content and selectional resrictions. 
Due to its light grammatical content, earlier natural language processing studies typically put light verbs 
in a stop word list and ignore them. Recently, however, classification and identification of light verbs 
and light verb construction have become a focus of study in computational linguistics, especially in the 
context of multi-word expression, information retrieval, disambiguation, and parsing. Past linguistic and 
computational studies on light verbs had very different foci. Linguistic studies tend to focus on the sta-
tus of light verbs and its various selectional constraints. While NLP studies have focused on light verbs 
in the context of either a multi-word expression (MWE) or a construction to be identified, classified, or 
translated, trying to overcome the apparent poverty of semantic content of light verbs. There has been 
nearly no work attempting to bridge these two lines of research. This paper takes this challenge by pro-
posing a corpus-bases study which classifies and captures syntactic-semantic difference among all light 
verbs. In this study, we first incorporate results from past linguistic studies to create annotated light verb 
corpora with syntactic-semantics features. We next adopt a statistic method for automatic identification 
of light verbs based on this annotated corpora. Our results show that a language resource based method-
ology optimally incorporating linguistic information can resolve challenges posed by light verbs in NLP. 
 
1 Introduction 
Identification of Light Verb Construction (LVC) plays an important role and poses a special challenge 
in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, e.g. information retrieval and machine 
translation. In addition to addressing issues related to LVC as a contributing factor to errors for vari-
ous applications, a few computational linguistics studies have targeted LVC in English specifically 
(e.g., Tu and Roth, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013). To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no 
computational linguistic study dealing with LVCs in Chinese specifically. It is important to know that, 
due to their lack of semantic content, light verbs can behave rather idiosyncratically in each language. 
Chinese LVC, in particular, has the characteristic that allows many different light verbs to share simi-
lar usage and be interchangeable in some context. We should also note that light verbs in Chinese can 
take both verbs, deverabal nouns, and eventive nouns, while the morphological status of these catego-
ries are typically unmarked, Hence, it is often difficult to differentiate a light verb from its non-light 
verb uses without careful analysis of the data. 
      It has been observed that some Chinese light verbs can be used interchangeably but will have 
different selectional restrictions in some (and generally more limited) contexts. For example, the five 
light verbs congshi, gao, jiayi, jinxing, zuo (these words originally meant ?engage?, ?do?, ?inflict?, 
?proceed?, ?do? respectively) can all take yanjiu ?to do research? as their complement and form a LVC. 
However, only the light verbs gao and jinxing can take bisai ?to play games? as complements, where-
as the other light verbs congshi, jiayi, and zuo cannot. Since light verbs are often interchangeable yet

each also has its own selectional restrictions, it makes the identification of light verbs themselves both 
a challenging and necessary task. It is also observed that this kind of selectional versatility actually led 
to variations among different variants of Mandarin Chinese, such as Mainland and Taiwan. The versa-
tility of Chinese light verbs makes the identification of LVCs more complicated than English. 
Therefore, to study the differences among different light verbs and different variants of Chinese is 
important but challenging in both linguistic studies and computational applications. With annotated 
data from comparable corpora of Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese, this paper proposes both 
statistical and machine learning approaches to differentiate five most frequently used light verbs in 
both variants based on their syntactic and semantic features. The experimental results of our approach 
show that we can reliably differentiate different light verbs from each other in each variety of Manda-
rin Chinese.  
There are several contributions in our work. Firstly, rather than focusing on only two light verbs 
jiayi and jinxing as in previous linguistic studies, we extended the study to more light verbs that are 
frequently used in Chinese. Actually, we will show that although jiayi and jinxing were often dis-
cussed in a pair in previous literature, the two are quite different from each other. Secondly, we show 
that statistical analysis and machine learning approaches are effective to identify the differences of 
light verbs and the variations demonstrated by the same light verb in different variants of Chinese. 
Thirdly, we provide a corpus that covers all typical uses of Chinese light verbs. Finally, the feature set 
we used in our study could be potentially used in the identification of Chinese LVCs in NLP applica-
tions. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and annotation of the data. In Sec-
tion 3, we conducted both statistical and machine learning methodologies to classify the five light 
verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. We discussed the implications and applications of our 
methodologies and the findings of our study in Section 4. Section 5 presents the conclusion and our 
future work. 
2 Corpus Annotation 
2.1 Data Collection 
The data for this study is extracted from Annotated Chinese Gigaword corpus (Huang, 2009) which 
was collected and available from LDC and contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, with 700 million 
characters from Taiwan Central News Agency and 400 million characters from Mainland Xinhua 
News Agency.  
The light verbs to be studied are congshi, gao, jiayi, jinxing, zuo; these five are among the most fre-
quently used light verbs in Chinese (Diao, 2004). 400 sentences are randomly selected for each light 
verb, half from the Mainland Gigaword subcorpus and the other from the Taiwan Gigaword subcorpus, 
which resulted in 2,000 sentences in total. The selection follows the principle that it could cover the 
different uses of each light verb.  
2.2 Feature Annotation 
Previous studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 1995; Huang et al., 2013, among 
others) have proposed several syntactic and semantic features to identify the similarities and differ-
ences among light verbs, especially between the two most typical ones, i.e. jinxing (originally ?pro-
ceed?) and jiayi (originally ?inflict?). For example, jinxing can take aspectual markers like zhe ?pro-
gressive marker?, le ?aspect marker?, and guo ?experiential aspect marker? while jiayi cannot (Zhou, 
1987);  congshi can take nominal phrases such as disan chanye?the tertiary industry? as its comple-
ment while jiayi cannot. A few features are also found to be variant-specific; for example, Huang and 
Lin (2013) find that only the congshi in Taiwan, but not in Mainland Mandarin, can take informal and 
negative event complements like xingjiaoyi ?sexual trade?. 
In our study, we selected 11 features which may help to differentiate different light verbs in each 
Mandarin variant as well as light verb variations among Mandarin variants, as in Table 1. All 2,000 
examples collected for analysis were manually annotated based on the 11 features. The annotator is a 
trained expert on Chinese linguistics. Any ambiguous cases were discussed with another two experts 
in order to reach an agreement.

3 Identification of light verbs based on annotated corpora  
In this section, we adopted both statistical analysis and machine learning approaches to identify the 
five light verbs (jiayi, jinxing, congshi, gao and zuo) on the corpora with 2,000 annotated examples. 
The results of all approaches show that the five light verbs can be differentiated from each other in 
both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. 
3.1 Identifying light verbs by statistical analysis 
Both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used in our study for the identification. The 
tool we used is the Polytomous Package in R (Arppe, 2008).  
 
 
77
3.1.1 Univariate analysis  
Among the 11 independent features, one was found with only one level in both Mainland and Taiwan 
variants, i.e. all five light verbs in the two variants show the same preference over the features and 
thus excluded from the analysis. The feature is OTHERLV (all light verbs do not co-occur with another 
light verb in a sentence). Chi-squared tests were conducted for the significance of the co-occurrence of 
the remaining ten features with individual light verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan variants. The 
chisq.posthoc() function in the Polytoumous Package (Arppe, 2008) in R was used for the tests. The 
results are presented in Table 2, where the ?+? and ?-? signs indicate respectively a statistically signif-
icant overuse and underuse of a light verb with a feature, and ?0? refers to a lack of statistical signifi-
cance.

Table 2: Identifying light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin via univariate analysis.  
 
Table 2 suggests that in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, each light verb shows significant 
preference for certain features, and thus can be distinguished from each other. For example, in Main-
land Mandarin, although both congshi and gao show significant preference for the features POS.N and 
ACCOMPEVT.no, congshi differs from gao in that it also significantly prefers DUREVT.yes (taking 
complements denoting durative events, e.g., yanjiu ?to research?), EVECOMP.no (event complements 
do not occur in subject position), and INTEREVT.no (not taking complements denoting events involv-
ing interaction among participants, e.g., taolun ?to discuss?), whereas gao shows either a dis-
preference or no significant preference over these features. Take gao and zuo in Taiwan Mandarin as 
another example. While both light verbs literally means ?to do?, there is no single feature preferred by 
both: gao prefers POS.N, ARGSTR.zero, FOREVT.yes, INTEREVT.no, ACCOMPEVT.no, whereas zuo 
shows significant preferences for POS.V, ARGSTR.two, ASP.le, and PSYEVT.yes.  
 
3.1.2 Multivariate analysis  
As shown in Table 2, in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, some of the five light verbs share some 
features, which thus explains why sometimes they can be interchangeably used. This also indicates (a) 
that a particular feature is unlikely to be preferred by only one light verb and thus differentiates the 
verb from the others; (b) a certain context may allow the occurrence of more than one light verb. In 
78
this sense, a multivariate analysis was adopted to better classify the five light verbs in each variant. 
The multivariate analysis used in the current study is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe, 2008), 
and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumous Package (Arppe, 2008) in R.  
The results from the multivariate analysis were summarized in Table 3.  The numbers shown in the 
table are the odds for the features in favor of or against the occurrence of each light verb: when the 
estimated odd is larger than 1, the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly increased by 
the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland jiayi occurring is significantly increased by ARGSTRtwo 
(76.47:1), followed by ACCOMPEVTyes (56:1), VOCOMPyes (23.54: 1), and PSYEVTyes (19.87: 1). 
When the estimated odd is smaller than 1, the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly 
decreased by the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland jinxing occurring is significantly decreased by 
ACCOMPEVTyes (0.1849: 1); in addition, ?inf? and ?1/inf? refer to odds larger than 10,000 and 
smaller than 1/10,000 respectively, whereas non-significant odds (p-value < 0.05) are given in paren-
theses.

Table 3: identifying light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin via multivariate analysis.  
 
   As shown in Table 3, each of the light verbs in each Mandarin variant shows its favor and disfavor 
of certain features. Take Mainland Mandarin for example: although congshi has no feature significant-
ly in its favor, but it is significantly disfavored by ARGSTRtwo (0.27:1) and ITEREVTyes (0.03:1); gao 
is disfavored by the aggregate of default variable values (0.02:1), and ACCOMPEVTyes (0.1:1), but is 
significantly favored by ARGSTRtwo and ARGSTRzero; the chance of jiayi?s ocucrrence is significant-
ly increased by ARGSTRtwo(76.47:1), ACCOMPEVTyes (56.25:1), VOCOMPyes (23.54:1), and 
PSYEVTyes (19:87:1); jinxing has INTEREVTyes and EVECOMPyes in its favor, but ACOMPEVTyes 
in its disfavor; no feature is significantly in the favor of zuo, but this light verb is significantly disfa-
vored by ARGSTRtwo, ARGSTRzero, FOREVTyes and INTEREVTyes.   
     The results in Table 3 also show that sometimes one key feature is able to identify two light verbs 
from each other, although not all five light verbs. Take Mainland Mandarin again for example. Most 
combinations of two light verbs from the five can be effectively differentiated by one feature. For in-
stance, the feature ARGSTRtwo can differentiate congshi/gao, congshi/jiayi, jiayi/zuo and gao/zuo; the 
feature INTEREVTyes can differentiate congshi/jinxing and jinxing/zuo; the feature ACCOMPEVTyes 
can differentiate the pairs gao/jiayi and jinxing/jiayi. 
3.2 Identifying light verbs by classification 
In this section, we resorted to machine learning technologies to study the same issue. Different classi-
fiers were adopted to discriminate the five light verbs with the annotated corpora: ID3, Logistic Re-
gression, Na?ve Bayesian and SVM that are implemented in WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) and 10-fold 
cross validations were performed separately on the Taiwan and Mainland corpora.  
79
The results were presented in Table 4. We can see that different classifiers provide similar results 
on both corpora, which means that the classification results are reliable and the features we annotated 
are effective in identifying the five light verbs. Overall, ID3 out-performs SVM slightly, with Logistic 
and NB not far behind. ID3 performs the best since the data is in low dimension. The detailed results 
including precision, recall and F-measure by ID3 on both corpora are shown in Table 5. The corre-
sponding confusion matrixes are presented in Table 6. The confusion matrixes suggest two very im-
portant generalizations: (a) all five verbs can be classified with good confidence, and (b) the overall 
classification patterns of the Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are very similar, which is consistent with 
the fact that Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are two variants. However, we also observe that the con-
fusion matrixes between various light verb pairs may differ between Mainland and Taiwan Chineses. 
This is the difference we would like to explore in the next section to propose a way to automatically 
predict these two variants. In addition, it is worth noting that all classifiers identify jiayi more effec-
tively than other light verbs, which thus shows a potential different usage of jiayi from the others.

3.3 Identifying light verbs by automatic clustering 
We further used the clustering algorithm to test the differentiability of the five light verbs in both 
Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. The results using the simple K-Means clustering algorithm on Tai-
wan and Mainland corpora are shown in Table 7. The results show that the light verb jiayi behaves 
80
quite differently from the other four light verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan corpora, which is similar 
to the analysis based on statistical methods in Section 3.1 and classification methods in Section 3.2. In 
both corpora, jiayi has a narrower usage than the other light verbs. Meanwhile, we can also find a clus-
ter which is mainly formed by instances of jiayi from the Mainland corpus (i.e. cluster 0). After closer 
examination of the examples in this cluster, we found that it mainly includes sentences where jiayi 
takes complements denoting accomplishment events, e.g. gaizheng ?to correct? and jiejue ?to solve?. 
However, jiayi in Taiwan corpus mainly takes complements denoting activity events, and thus almost 
all instances of Taiwan jiayi are mixed with those of the other light verbs. Meanwhile, our results 
show a tendency that all other light verbs (jinxing, congshi, zuo, and gao) mostly take activity com-
plements but fewer accomplishment complements in both Taiwan and Mainland corpora. More dis-
cussion on the light verb variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin can be found in (Huang 
et al., 2014).

4 Applications and Implications 
4.1 Implications for Future Studies 
In the study above, we were able to annotate a corpus with all the types of significant context and, 
based on this annotated corpus, we were able to use statistic model to differentiate the use of different 
light verbs in different contexts. Such a module of generic linguistic tools can have several potentially 
very useful applications. First, in translation, LVC is one of the most difficult constructions as there is 
less grammatical or contextual information to make the correct translation. Our approach is especially 
promising. As we encode contextual selection information for all light verbs, the same approach can 
be applied to the other languages in the target-source pair to produce optimal pair. Second, in infor-
mation extraction, selection of different light verbs often conveys subtle difference in meanings. Our 
ability to differentiate similar light verbs in the same context could have great potential in extracting 
the subtle information change/increase in the same context. Lastly, in second language learning as well 
as error detection, light verbs have been one of the most challenging ones. Our studies can be readily 
applied to either error detection or second language learning environment to provide the correct con-
text where a certain light very is preferred over another. 
4.2 From light verb variations to variants for the same language 
One of the biggest challenges in computational processing of languages is probably to identify newly 
emergent variants, such as the cross-strait variations of Mandarin Chinese. For these two variants, the 
most commonly cited ones were on lexical differences. Systematic grammatical differences were 
much more difficult to study and hence rarely reported (comp. Huang et al., 2009). As these are two 
newly divergent variants, their main grammars are almost all identical, except for some subtle differ-
ences, such as the selection between different light verbs and their complements. Our preliminary re-
sults of univariate and multivariate analysis can be found in Table 2 and 3. It shows not only the simi-
larities/differences among the light verbs in each variety (e.g., both ML and TW congshi and gao 
show preferences over POS.N, whereas both ML and TW jiayi show dispreference), but also the simi-
larities/differences of the corresponding light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin. For instance, 
jinxing in TW tends to take VO compounds as its complements e.g., jinxing toupiao ?cast a vote?, 
81
which is consistent with the analysis in (Huang et al., 2013) (see more in Huang et al., 2014). But one 
thing should be pointed out is the difference is more between a significant and non-significant feature, 
rather than between a significant positive and significant negative feature.  
5 Conclusion 
In this paper, we addressed the issue of automatic classification of Chinese light verbs based on their 
usage distribution, based on an annotated corpus marking relevant contextual information for light 
verbs. We used both statistical methods and machine learning technologies to address this issue. It is 
found that our approaches are effective in identifying light verbs and their variations. The automatic 
generated semantic and syntactic features can also be used for future studies on other light verbs as 
well as other lexical categories. The result suggested that richly annotated language resources paired 
with appropriate tool can lead to effective general solution for some common issues faced by linguis-
tics and natural language processing.
