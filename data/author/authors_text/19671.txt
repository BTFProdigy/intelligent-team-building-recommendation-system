Abstract
This paper proposes an architecture for an open-domain conversational system and evaluates an
implemented system. The proposed architecture is fully composed of modules based on natu-
ral language processing techniques. Experimental results using human subjects show that our
architecture achieves significantly better naturalness than a retrieval-based baseline and that its
naturalness is close to that of a rule-based system using 149K hand-crafted rules.
1 Introduction
Although task-oriented dialogue systems have been extensively researched over the decades (Walker
et al., 2001; Williams et al., 2013), it is only recently that non-task-oriented dialogue, open-domain
conversation, or chat has been attracting attention for its social and entertainment aspects (Bickmore
and Picard, 2005; Ritter et al., 2011; Bessho et al., 2012). Creating an open-domain conversational
system is a challenging problem. In task-oriented dialogue systems, it is possible to prepare knowledge
for a domain and create understanding and generation modules for that domain (Nakano et al., 2000).
However, for open-domain conversation, such preparation cannot be performed. Since it is difficult to
handle users? open-domain utterances, to create workable systems, conventional approaches have used
hand-crafted rules (Wallace, 2004). Although elaborate rules may work well, the problem with the rule-
based approach is the high cost and the dependence on individual skills of developers, which hinders
systematic development. Another problem with the rule-based approach is its low coverage; that is, the
inability to handle unexpected utterances.
The recent increase of web data has propelled the development of approaches that use data retrieved
from the web for open-domain conversation (Shibata et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2011). The merit of such
retrieval-based approaches is that, owing to the diversity of the web, systems can retrieve at least some
responses for user input, which solves the coverage problem. However, this comes at the cost of utterance
quality. Since the web, especially Twitter, is inherently noisy, it is, in many cases, difficult to sift out
appropriate sentences from retrieval results.
In this paper, we propose an architecture for an open-domain conversational system. The proposed
architecture is fully composed of modules based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our
stance is not just to hand-craft or to search the web for utterances, but to create a system that can fully
understand and generate utterances. We want to show that it is possible to build an open-domain conver-
sational system by combining NLP modules, which will open the way to a systematic development and
improvement. We describe our open-domain conversational system based on our architecture and present
results of an evaluation of its performance by human subjects. We compare our system with rule-based
and retrieval-based systems, and show that our architecture is a promising direction. In this work, we
regard the term open-domain conversation to be interchangeable with non-task-oriented dialogue, casual
conversation (Eggins and Slade, 2005), chat, or social dialogue (Bickmore and Cassell, 2000). We use
the term to denote that user input is not restricted in any way as in open-domain question answering
