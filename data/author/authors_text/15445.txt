Abstract
This paper describes a new Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm which extends two
well-known variations of the Lesk WSD method. Given a word and its context, Lesk algorithm
exploits the idea of maximum number of shared words (maximum overlaps) between the context
of a word and each definition of its senses (gloss) in order to select the proper meaning. The main
contribution of our approach relies on the use of a word similarity function defined on a distribu-
tional semantic space to compute the gloss-context overlap. As sense inventory we adopt Babel-
Net, a large multilingual semantic network built exploiting both WordNet and Wikipedia. Besides
linguistic knowledge, BabelNet also represents encyclopedic concepts coming from Wikipedia.
The evaluation performed on SemEval-2013 Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation shows
that our algorithm goes beyond the most frequent sense baseline and the simplified version of the
Lesk algorithm. Moreover, when compared with the other participants in SemEval-2013 task,
our approach is able to outperform the best system for English.
1 Introduction
Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms aim at resolving word ambiguity with-
out the use of annotated corpora. Among these, two categories of knowledge-based algorithms gained
popularity: overlap- and graph-based methods. The former owes its success to the simple intuition un-
derlying that family of algorithms, while the diffusion of the latter started growing after the development
of semantic networks.
The overlap-based algorithms stem from the Lesk (1986) one, which inspired a whole family of meth-
ods that exploit the number of common words in two sense definitions (glosses) to select the proper
meaning in a context. Glosses play a key role in Lesk algorithm, which exploits only two types of in-
formation: 1) the set of dictionary entries, one for each possible word meaning, and 2) the information
about the context in which the word occurs. The idea is simple: given two words, the algorithm selects
those senses whose definitions have the maximum overlap, i.e. the highest number of common words in
the definition of the senses. In order to extract definitions, Lesk adopted the Oxford Advanced Learner?s
dictionary. This approach suffers from two problems: 1) complexity, the number of comparisons in-
creases combinatorially with the number of words in a text; and 2) definition expressiveness, the overlap
is based only on word co-occurrences in glosses. The first problem was tackled by a ?simplified? version
of Lesk algorithm (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000), which disambiguated each word separately. Given
a word, the meaning whose gloss shows the maximum overlap with the current context, represented by
the surrounding words, is selected. The simplified Lesk significantly outperforms the original Lesk al-
gorithm as proved by Vasilescu et al. (2004). The second problem was faced by Banerjee and Pedersen
(2002), who proposed an ?adapted? Lesk algorithm. The adapted variation exploits relationships among
meanings: each gloss is extended by the definitions of semantically related meanings. Banerjee and
Pedersen adopt WordNet as semantic network and their algorithm takes into account several relations:

hypernym, hyponym, holonym, meronym, troponym and attribute relation. The adapted algorithm out-
performs the Lesk one in disambiguating nouns in SensEval-2 English task. Despite these improvements,
overlap-based algorithms failed to stand the pace with figures achieved by graph approaches. Their abil-
ity to disambiguate all words in a sequence at once, meanwhile exploiting the existing interconnections
(edges) between senses (nodes), has made these algorithms more principled than methods that use the
sense definition overlaps. Moreover, the success of PageRank in web search has inspired a new vein of
algorithms for sense disambiguation that blossomed during the past years. Although graph-based algo-
rithms have taken advantage of the rich set of relationships available in dictionaries like WordNet, they
completely neglected the role of glosses in the disambiguation process.
From our standpoint, glosses are an important piece of information since they extensionally define a
word meaning. In this paper we propose a revised version of the simplified and adapted Lesk variations
that overcomes limits due to the definition expressiveness. Our method replaces the concept of overlap
with that of similarity. Similarity is computed on a Distributional Semantic Space (DSS) in order to
account for semantic relationships between words occurring in the definition and context, for as they
emerge from the use in the language. Indeed, Distributional Semantics Models (DSM) exploit the ge-
ometric metaphor of meanings, which are represented through points into a space where distance is a
measure of semantic similarity. The point representation inherits information about all co-occurring con-
text words, and then it is suitable for computing the overlap where no exact word matching can occur. In
addition, we introduce two functions: the former assigns an inverse gloss frequency (IGF) score to each
term occurring in the extended gloss, the latter exploits information about sense frequencies extracted
from an annotated corpus.
We choose BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) as sense inventory. BabelNet is a very large se-
mantic network built up exploiting both WordNet and Wikipedia. Besides linguistic knowledge, it also
represents encyclopedic concepts coming from Wikipedia and information about named entities. This
makes our approach inherently multilingual and suitable for tasks such as named entity disambiguation.
The evaluation on SemEval-2013 Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (Navigli et al., 2013) proves
that our method is able to outperform both baselines (simplified Lesk and most frequent sense) and, for
English language, also the best SemEval-2013 participant.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to Distributional Semantic
Models, while Section 3 describes the proposed methodology. Evaluation and details about the algo-
rithm implementation are reported in Section 4, while related work is described in Section 5. Finally,
conclusions close the paper.
2 Distributional Semantic Models
Semantic (or Word) Spaces are geometrical spaces of words where vectors express concepts, and their
proximity is a measure of the semantic relatedness. One of their greatest virtues is that they can be
built using entirely unsupervised analysis of free text. Moreover, they make few language-specific as-
sumptions since only tokenized text is needed. WordSpaces are inspired by the distributional hypothesis
(Harris, 1968) whereby the meaning of a word is determined by the rules of its use in the context of
ordinary and concrete language behaviour. This means that words are semantically similar if they share
contexts (surrounding words). Building a WordSpace involves the definition of a distributional model,
that is a quadruple (Lowe, 2001) consisting of: the space basis (word vectors) and dimension; the func-
tion that takes into account word co-occurrences and how these are represented in the final vector; a
similarity function defined over vectors; and eventually a map that transforms the vector space.
Our idea is to apply DSMs to WSD for computing the overlap between the gloss of the meaning and the
context as a similarity measure between their corresponding vector representations in a SemanticSpace.
In this paper we build a SemanticSpace (co-occurrences matrix M ) by analysing the distribution of words
in a large corpus, then M is reduced using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais,
1997). LSA collects the text data in a co-occurrence matrix, which is then decomposed into smaller
matrices with Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD). Hence, LSA represents high-dimensional vectors
in a lower-dimensional space while capturing latent semantic structures in the text data.
1592
Given the vector representation of two words, DSMs usually compute their similarity as the cosine of
the angle between them. In our case, the gloss and the context are composed by several terms, so in order
to compute their similarity we need a method to compose the words occurring in these sentences. It is
possible to combine words through vector addition (+) that corresponds to the point-wise sum of vector
components. For each set of terms, phrase or sentence, we build its vector representation by adding the
vectors associated to the words it is composed of. Then, the similarity measure is computed as the cosine
similarity between the two phrases/sentences. More formally, if g = g
1
g
2
...g
n
and c = c
1
c
2
...c
m
are
the gloss and the context respectively, we build their vector representation g and c in the SemanticSpace
through addition of word vectors belonging to them:
g = g
1
+ g
2
+ . . . + g
n
c = c
1
+ c
2
. . . + c
m
(1)
The cosine similarity between g and c is a measure of the similarity of the two sentences that we consider
as a score associated to the candidate meaning with respect to the context.
3 Methodology
At the heart of our approach there is the simplified Lesk algorithm. Given a text w
1
w
2
...w
n
of n words,
we disambiguate one at a time taking into account the similarity between the gloss associated to each
sense of the target word w
i
and the context. The meaning whose gloss has the highest similarity is
selected. The context could be represented by a subset of surrounding words or the whole text where the
word occurs. Moreover, taking into account the idea of the Banerjee?s adaptation, we expand each gloss
with those of related meanings.
Our sense inventory is BabelNet, a very large multilingual semantic network built relying on both
WordNet and Wikipedia. In BabelNet linguistic knowledge is enriched with encyclopedic concepts
coming from Wikipedia. WordNet synsets and Wikipedia concepts (pages) are connected in an auto-
matic way. We choose BabelNet for three reasons: 1) glosses are richer and contain text from Wikipedia,
2) it is multilingual, thus the proposed algorithm can be applied to several languages, and 3) it also con-
tains information about named entities, thus an algorithm using BabelNet could be potentially used to
disambiguate entities.
Our algorithm consists of five steps:
1. Look-up. For each word w
i
, the set of possible word meanings is retrieved from BabelNet. First,
we look for senses coming from WordNet (or WordNet translated into languages different from
English). If no sense is found, we retrieve senses from Wikipedia. We adopt this strategy because
mixing up all senses from Wikipedia and WordNet results in worse performance. Conversely, if a
word does not occur in WordNet it is probably a named entity, thus Wikipedia could provide useful
information to disambiguate it.
2. Building the context. The context C is represented by the l words to the left and to the right of w
i
.
We also adopt a particular configuration in which the context is represented by all the words that
occur in the text.
3. Gloss expansion. We indicate with s
ij
the j-th sense associated to the target word w
i
. We expand
the gloss g
ij
that describes the j-th sense using the function ?getRelatedMap? provided by BabelNet
API. This method returns all the meanings related to a particular sense. For each related meaning,
we retrieve its gloss and concatenate it to the original gloss g
ij
of s
ij
. During this step we remove
glosses belonging to synsets related by the ?antonym? relationship. The result of this step is an
extended gloss denoted by g
?
ij
. In order to give more importance to terms occurring in the original
gloss, the words in the expanded gloss are weighed taking into account both the distance between
s
ij
and the related synsets and the word frequencies. More details about term scoring are reported
in Subsection 3.2.
1593
4. Building semantic vectors. Exploiting the DSM described in Section 2, we build the vector repre-
sentation for each gloss g
?
ij
associated with the senses of w
i
and the context C.
5. Selecting the correct meaning. For each gloss g
?
ij
, the algorithm computes the cosine similarity
between its vector representation and context vector C. The similarity is linearly combined with the
probability p(s
ij
|w
i
) that takes into account the sense distribution of s
ij
given the word w
i
; details
are reported in Subsection 3.1. The sense with the highest similarity is chosen.
In order to compare our approach to the simplified Lesk algorithm, we developed a variation of our
method in which, rather than building the semantic vectors, we count the common words between each
extended gloss g
?
ij
and the context C. In this case, we apply stemming to maximize the overlap.
3.1 Sense Distribution
The selection of the correct meaning takes also into account the senses distribution of the word w
i
. We
retrieve information about sense occurrences from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which reports for each
word w
i
its sense inventory S
i
with the number of times that the word w
i
was tagged with s
ij
in SemCor.
SemCor is a collection of 352 documents manually annotated with WordNet synsets. We introduce the
sense distribution factor in order to consider the probability that a word w
i
can be tagged with the sense
s
ij
. Moreover, since some synsets do not occur in SemCor and can cause zero probabilities, we adopt an
additive smoothing (also called Laplace smoothing). Finally the probability is computed as follow:
p(s
ij
|w
i
) =
t(w
i
, s
ij
) + 1
#w
i
+ |S
i
|
(2)
where t(w
i
, s
ij
) is the number of times the word w
i
is tagged with s
ij
and #w
i
is the number of occur-
rences of w
i
in SemCor.
3.2 Gloss Term Scoring
The extended gloss conflates words from the gloss directly associated with the synset s
ij
with those of
the glosses appearing in the related synsets. When we add words to the extended gloss, we weigh them
by a factor inversely proportional to the distance in the graph (number of edges) between s
ij
and the
related synsets so to reflect their different origin. Let d be that distance, then the weight is computed
as
1
1+d
. Finally, we re-weigh words using a strategy similar to the inverse document frequency (IDF )
that we call inverse gloss frequency (IGF ). The idea is that if a word occurs in all the extended glosses
associated with a word, then it poorly characterizes the meaning description. Let gf
?
k
be the number of
extended glosses that contain a word w
k
, then IGF is computed as follow:
IGF
k
= 1 + log
2
|S
i
|
gf
?
k
(3)
This approach is similar to the idea proposed by Vasilescu et al. (2004), where TF-IDF of terms is
computed taking into account the glosses in the whole WordNet, while we compute IGF considering
only the glosses associated to each word. Finally, the weight for the word w
k
appearing h times in the
extended gloss g
?
ij
is given by:
weight(w
k
, g
?
ij
) = h? IGF
k
?

4 Evaluation
The evaluation is performed using the dataset provided by the organizers of the Task-12 of SemEval-
2013. The task concerns Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation, a traditional WSD ?all-words? ex-
periment in which systems are expected to assign the correct BabelNet synset to all occurrences of noun
phrases (which refer to both disambiguated nouns and named entities) within arbitrary texts in different
languages.
1594
The goal of our evaluation is twofold: to prove that our strategy outperforms the simplified Lesk
approach, and then to compare our system with respect to the other task participants.
In both the experiments we consider two languages, English and Italian, to evaluate performance in a
multilingual setting. It is important to underline that in our approach only stemming and the corpus used
to build the distributional model are language dependent.
4.1 System Setup
Our method
1
is completely developed in JAVA using BabelNet API 1.1.1 provided by the authors
2
. We
adopt the standard Lucene analyzer to tokenize both glosses and the context, while Snowball library
3
is
used for stemming in several European languages. The SemanticSpaces for the two languages are built
using proprietary code relying on two Lucene indexes, which contain documents from British National
Corpus (BNC) for English, and from Wikipedia dump for Italian, respectively. For each language, the
co-occurrences matrix M contains information about the top 100,000 most frequent words in the corpus.
M is reduced by LSA using the SVDLIBC tool
4
and setting a reduced dimension equal to 200. The
result of the SVD decomposition is stored in a binary format used by our algorithm implementation.
It is important to underline that BabelNet Italian glosses are taken from MultiWordNet, which does
not contain glosses for all the synsets. Then, we replace each missing gloss by the words that belong to
the synset.
We evaluate our system by setting two parameters: 1) the context size (3, 5, 10, 20 and the whole text);
2) the use of information about sense distribution (see Formula (2) in Subsection 3.1).
The gloss term scoring function is always applied, since it provides better results. The synset distance
d used to expand the gloss is fixed to 1; we experimented with a distance d set to 2 without any improve-
ment. The sense distribution is linearly combined with the cosine similarity score through a coefficient
set to 0.5.
Some notes about sense frequency: by using only sense distribution to select a sense we obtain an
algorithm that performs like the most frequent sense (MFS). In other words, the algorithm always assigns
the most probable meaning. It is well known that this approach obtains very good performance and it is
hard to be outperformed especially by unsupervised approaches.
4.2 English Evaluation
Table 1 reports results of our algorithm (DSM) compared with the best simplified Lesk approaches
(LESK) in terms of precision (P), recall (R), F-measure (F) and attempt (A). Attempt is the percentage
of words disambiguated by the algorithm. SenseDistr. column reports the information about when the
sense distribution formula (see Subsection 3.1) is used (Y) or not (N); it is also important to point out
that MSF produces the same results of using only sense distribution i.e. the first sense is the most likely
one. We have experimented different context sizes also for the Lesk algorithm, although for the sake of
readability we report only the best Lesk with and without sense distribution.
All our runs always obtain an attempt of 100%; thus the precision and recall values are always the
same. The run EN.DSM.10 obtains the best result using both sense distribution information and the
whole text (W ) as context. Another important outcome is the result obtained by the run EN.DSM.5 that,
without information about sense distribution, is able to overcome the MFS baseline. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first completely unsupervised system able to overcome the MFS baseline without
using sense frequency. Both results (EN.DSM.10 and EN.DSM.5) suggest that the vector representation
of the whole text helps the system to achieve the best performance.
Considering the Lesk method, generally, the best size for the context is 3, then a larger set of sur-
rounding words results in worse performance, differently to what happens in the distributional approach.
This is probably due to the fact that words distant from the target one match some incorrect glosses. It is
important to note that no simplified Lesk run is able to overcome the MFS baseline.

Table 2 reports results of our algorithm for the Italian language. In this case we still obtain the best result
(IT.DSM.10) using DSM and sense distribution. As for English, the systems without sense distribution
overcome the MFS baseline. However, in this case simplified Lesk with sense distribution is able to
outperform the MFS. We ascribe this different behaviour to the problem of missing glosses that we
solved by adding the words in the synset.

4.4 Task Results
In this subsection, we report our best performance (Table 3) with respect to the other participants in the
SemEval-2013 Task-12 on multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation, for both English (Table 3a) and
Italian (Table 3b).
Regarding the English language, our best methods are able to outperform all the systems. It is im-
portant to underline that our method without knowledge about sense distribution (EN.DSM.5) outper-
forms both the MFS and all the task participants. This is a very important outcome because generally

knowledge-base approaches without information about sense frequencies obtain low results. For exam-
ple, the UMCC-DLSI system (Guti?errez et al., 2013) exploits sense frequency to modify prior probability
of synset nodes in the PageRank, and DAEBAK system (Manion and Sainudiin, 2013) uses MFS when it
is not able to select a meaning. Our experiments show that a dictionary-based approach and the adoption
of a distributional semantic model for computing the similarity are enough to obtain good results. More-
over, by adding information about sense frequencies we are able to boost our performance and obtain
over 70% of F-measure.
For Italian, our systems are not able to reach the same performance as for English, although they still
outperform the MFS and two task participants. We think that these results are due to the same problem
observed for the Italian evaluation (Subsection 4.3), that is to say, the poor quality of glosses.
5 Related Work
WSD has been an active area of NLP whose roots stem from early work in Machine Translation. Am-
biguity resolution has been pursued as a way to improve retrieval systems, and generally to get better
information access. Despite its ancient roots and perceived importance, this task is still far from being
resolved.
Our WSD method relies on both the Lesk algorithm and its two variants: simplified (Kilgarriff and
Rosenzweig, 2000) and adapted (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002). Several approaches have modified the
Lesk algorithm to reduce is exponential complexity, like the one based on Simulated Annealing (Cowie
et al., 1992). Basile et al. (2007) adopted the simplified Lesk algorithm to disambiguate adjectives
and adverbs, combining it with other two methods for nouns and verbs: the combination of different
approaches for each part-of-speech resulted in better performance with respect to the use of a single
strategy. More recently, Schwab et al. (2013) proposed GETALP, another unsupervised WSD algorithm
inspired by Lesk. Their approach computes a local similarity using the classical Lesk measure (overlap
between glosses), and then the local similarity is propagated to the whole text (global similarity) using
an algorithm inspired by the Ant Colony. This approach got the lowest results during the SemEval-2013
Task 12 evaluation due to a bug in the system. However, the correct implementation achieves 0.583 of
F-measure for English and 0.528 for Italian.
Another problem with the Lesk-based approaches is to maximize the chances of overlap between
glosses or between the gloss and the context. To solve this problem, Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) ex-
tended WordNet with Wikipedia pages (WordNet++) in order to produce a richer lexical resource, ob-
taining the English portion of BabelNet. The simple Lesk algorithm built over WordNet++ outperformed
the WordNet-base version, although it was not successful in overtaking the MFS baseline. Our approach
tries to extend glosses using related synsets and adopts distributional semantics to address the problem
of data sparsity. A different perspective has been recently proposed by Wang and Hirst (2014), where the
limits of the exact string matching between glosses and context are overcome by a Naive Bayes-based
similarity measure.
1597
Other unsupervised approaches rely on graph algorithms that exploit the graph generated by a semantic
network where the senses are connected through semantic relations. For example, DAEBAK (Manion
and Sainudiin, 2013) adopts a sub-graph of BabelNet generated taking into account the surrounding
words of the target word. A measure of connectivity computed on the sub-graph is used to extract the
most probable sense. The MFS is used when the algorithm is not able to choose any sense. Also Navigli
and Lapata (2010) exploit the idea of graph connectivity measures for identifying the most important
node (sense) in the graph. Experiments conducted on SemCor show that the Degree Centrality provides
best results compared to other well known techniques, such as PageRank, HITS, Key Player Problem
and Betweenness Centrality. Graph-based methods also showed their validity during the SemEval 2013
Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation task. The best system, UMCC-DLSI (Guti?errez et al., 2013),
builds a graph using several resources: WordNet, WordNet Domains and the eXtended WordNet. Then,
the best sense is selected using the PageRank algorithm where the a priori probability of senses is es-
timated according to the sense frequencies. This is an extension of UBK algorithm (Agirre and Soroa,
2009), the first application of personalized PageRank to the WSD problem.
On the distributional side, Brody and Lapata (2008) use distributional similarity to automatically an-
notate a corpus for training a supervised method. Each target word in the corpus is paired with a list
of neighbours selected via distributional similarity. A neighbour is linked to a sense in WordNet and
then it is used for the annotation. Differently from our approach, distributional similarity is used to auto-
matically annotate a training corpus rather than directly disambiguate terms. Miller et al. (2012) exploit
a distributional thesaurus to expand both glosses and the context, then they apply the classical word
overlap adopted in the simplified Lesk. This approach is strongly related to our, although our approach
directly computes the overlap in the geometric space that implements the distributional semantic model.
In particular, we build a vector representation for both the gloss and the context. In recent years, other
approaches have tried to solve unsupervised WSD relying on distributional information. Gliozzo et al.
(2005) build a matrix taking into account words and WordNet domains. The matrix is reduced using LSA
and then it is combined in a kernel exploited in a supervised approach. Martinez et al. (2008) propose a
method based on topic signatures automatically constructed using the Web, while Li et al. (2010) adopt
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to compute a conditional probability between a sense and the context.
In this model, a sense is represented by its paraphrases used to build the LDA model.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we describe an unsupervised WSD approach which selects the best sense according to the
distributional similarity with respect to the context. In particular, the similarity is computed representing
both the gloss and the context as vectors in a geometric space generated by a distributional semantic
model based on LSA. The evaluation, conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013, shows promising
results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and, for English, also the
other task participants. We provide two implementations of our approach, with and without exploiting
sense frequencies. For English, both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the
MFS. Differently, for Italian both implementations do not reach the figures of the best participant, but
they are able to defeat the MFS. As future work, we plan to extend our evaluation to other languages, and
to investigate how to adapt our approach to a specific domain. In particular, distributional models built
upon a domain corpus, and sense frequencies extracted from the same corpus, could result in a domain
adaptation of our algorithm.

Abstract
We report the results of UNIBA participation
in the first SemEval-2012 Semantic Textual
Similarity task. Our systems rely on distribu-
tional models of words automatically inferred
from a large corpus. We exploit three differ-
ent semantic word spaces: Random Indexing
(RI), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) over RI,
and vector permutations in RI. Runs based on
these spaces consistently outperform the base-
line on the proposed datasets.
1 Background and Related Research
SemEval-2012 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)
task (Agirre et al, 2012) aims at providing a gen-
eral framework to ?examine the degree of semantic
equivalence between two sentences.?
We propose an approach to Semantic Textual
Similarity based on distributional models of words,
where the geometrical metaphor of meaning is ex-
ploited. Distributional models are grounded on the
distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968), according
to which the meaning of a word is determined by
the set of textual contexts in which it appears. These
models represent words as vectors in a high dimen-
sional vector space. Word vectors are built from a
large corpus in such a way that vector dimensions
reflect the different uses (or contexts) of a word in
the corpus. Hence, the meaning of a word is de-
fined by its use, and words used in similar contexts
are represented by vectors near in the space. In this
way, semantically related words like ?basketball?
and ?volleyball?, which occur frequently in similar
contexts, say with words ?court, play, player?, will
be represented by near points. Different definitions
of contexts give rise to different (semantic) spaces.
A context can be a document, a sentence or a fixed
window of surrounding words. Contexts and words
can be stored through a co-occurrence matrix, whose
columns correspond to contexts, and rows to words.
Therefore, the strength of the semantic association
between words can be computed as the cosine simi-
larity of their vector representations.
Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al,
1990), BEAGLE (Jones and Mewhort, 2007),
Random Indexing (Kanerva, 1988), Hyperspace
Analogue to Language (Burgess et al, 1998),
WordSpace (Sch?tze and Pedersen, 1995) are all
techniques conceived to build up semantic spaces.
However, all of them intend to represent semantics at
a word scale. Although vectors addition and multi-
plication are two well defined operations suitable for
composing words in semantic spaces, they miss tak-
ing into account the underlying syntax, which regu-
lates the compositionality of words. Some efforts to-
ward this direction are emerging (Clark and Pulman,
2007; Clark et al, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010;
Coecke et al, 2010; Basile et al, 2011; Clarke,
2012), which resulted in theoretical work corrob-
orated by empirical evaluation on how small frag-
ments of text compose (e.g. noun-noun, adjective-
noun, and verb-noun pairs).
2 Methodology
Our approach to STS is inspired by the latest devel-
opments about semantic compositionality and distri-
butional models. The general methodology is based
on the construction of a semantic space endowed
591
with a vector addition operator. The vector addition
sums the word vectors of each pair of sentences in-
volved in the evaluation. The result consists of two
vectors whose similarity can be computed by co-
sine similarity. However, this simple methodology
translates a text into a mere bag-of-word representa-
tion, depriving the text of its syntactic construction,
which also influences the overall meaning of the sen-
tence. In order to deal with this limit, we experi-
ment two classical methods for building a semantic
space, namely Random Indexing and Latent Seman-
tic Analysis, along with a new method based on vec-
tor permutations, which tries to encompass syntactic
information directly into the resulting space.
2.1 Random Indexing
Our first method is based on Random Indexing (RI),
introduced by Kanerva (Kanerva, 1988). This tech-
nique allows us to build a semantic space with no
need for (either term-document or term-term) ma-
trix factorization, because vectors are inferred by
using an incremental strategy. Moreover, it allows
us to solve efficiently the problem of reducing di-
mensions, which is one of the key features used to
uncover the ?latent semantic dimensions? of a word
distribution.
RI1 (Widdows and Ferraro, 2008) is based on
the concept of Random Projection according to
which high dimensional vectors chosen randomly
are ?nearly orthogonal?.
Formally, given an n ? m matrix A and an m ?
k matrix R made up of k m-dimensional random
vectors, we define a new n? k matrix B as follows:
Bn,k = An,m?Rm,k k << m (1)
The new matrix B has the property to preserve the
distance between points scaled by a multiplicative
factor (Johnson and Lindenstrauss, 1984).
Specifically, RI creates the semantic space Bn,k
in two steps (we consider a fixed window w of terms
as context):
1. A context vector is assigned to each term. This
vector is sparse, high-dimensional and ternary,
which means that its elements can take values
1An implementation of RI can be found at:
http://code.google.com/p/semanticvectors/
in {-1, 0, 1}. A context vector contains a small
number of randomly distributed non-zero ele-
ments, and the structure of this vector follows
the hypothesis behind the concept of Random
Projection;
2. Context vectors are accumulated by analyzing
co-occurring terms in a window w. The seman-
tic vector for a term is computed as the sum of
the context vectors for terms which co-occur in
w.
2.2 Latent Semantic Analysis
Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al, 1990)
relies on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
of a term-document co-occurrence matrix. Given
a matrix M, it can be decomposed in the product
of three matrices U?V>, where U and V are the
orthonormal matrices and ? is the diagonal matrix
of singular values of M placed in decreasing order.
Computing the LSA on the co-occurrence matrix M
can be a computationally expensive task, as a corpus
can contain thousands of terms. Hence, we decided
to apply LSA to the reduced approximation gener-
ated by RI. It is important to point out that no trun-
cation of singular values is performed. Since com-
puting the similarity between any two words is equal
to taking the corresponding entry in the MM> ma-
trix, we can exploit the relation
MM> = U?V>V?>U> = U??>U> =
(U?)(U?)>
Hence, the application of LSA to RI makes possible
to represent each word in the U? space.
A similar approach was investigated by Sellberg
and J?nsson (2008) for retrieval of similar FAQs in
a Question Answering system. Authors showed that
halving the matrix dimension by applying the RI re-
sulted in a drastic reduction of LSA computation
time. Certainly there was also a performance price
to be paid, however general performance was bet-
ter than VSM and RI respectively. We also experi-
mented LSA computed on RI versus LSA applied to
the original matrix during the tuning of our systems.
Surprisingly, we found that LSA applied on the re-
duced matrix gives better results than LSA. How-
ever, these results are not reported as they are not
the focus of this evaluation.
592
2.3 Vector Permutations in RI
The classical distributional models can handle only
one definition of context at a time, such as the whole
document or the window w. A method to add infor-
mation about context in RI is proposed in (Sahlgren
et al, 2008). The authors describe a strategy to en-
code word order in RI by the permutation of coor-
dinates in context vector. When the coordinates are
shuffled using a random permutation, the resulting
vector is nearly orthogonal to the original one. That
operation corresponds to the generation of a new
random vector. Moreover, by applying a predeter-
mined mechanism to obtain random permutations,
such as elements rotation, it is always possible to
reconstruct the original vector using the reverse per-
mutations. By exploiting this strategy it is possible
to obtain different random vectors for each context
in which the term occurs.
Our idea is to encode syntactic dependen-
cies using vector permutations. A syntactic
dependency between two words is defined as
dep(head, dependent), where dep is the syntac-
tic link which connects the dependent word to the
head word. Generally speaking, dependent is the
modifier, object or complement, while head plays a
key role in determining the behavior of the link. For
example, subj(eat, cat) means that ?cat? is the sub-
ject of ?eat?. In that case the head word is ?eat?,
which plays the role of verb.
The key idea is to encode in the semantic space in-
formation about syntactic dependencies which link
words together. Rather than representing the kind
of dependency, our focus is to encompass informa-
tion about the existence of such a relation between
words in the construction of the space. The method
adopted to construct a semantic space that takes into
account both syntactic dependencies and Random
Indexing can be defined as follows:
1. a context vector is assigned to each term, as de-
scribed in Section 2.1 (Random Indexing);
2. context vectors are accumulated by analyzing
terms which are linked by a dependency. In
particular the semantic vector for each term ti
is computed as the sum of the inverse-permuted
context vectors for the terms tj which are de-
pendents of ti, and the permuted vectors for
the terms tj which are heads of ti. Moreover,
the context vector of ti, and those of tj terms
which appears in a dependency relation with
it, are sum to the final semantic vector in or-
der to provide distributional evidence of co-
occurrence. Each permutation is computed as
a forward/backward rotation of one element. If
?1 is a permutation of one element, the inverse-
permutation is defined as ??1: the elements
rotation is performed by one left-shifting step.
Formally, denoting with x the context vector
for a term, we compute the semantic vector for
the term ti as follows:
si = xi +
?
j
?dep(ti,tj)
(
??1xj + xj
)
+
?
k
?dep(tk,ti)
(
?1xk + xk
)
Adding permuted vectors to the head word and
inverse-permuted vectors to the corresponding de-
pendent word allows to encode the information
about both heads and dependents into the space.
This approach is similar to the one investigated by
(Cohen et al, 2010) to encode relations between
medical terms.
3 Evaluation
Dataset Description. SemEval-2012 STS is a first
attempt to provide a ?unified framework for the eval-
uation of modular semantic components.? The task
consists in computing the similarity between pair
of texts, returning a similarity score. Sentences
are extracted from five publicly available datasets:
MSR (Paraphrase Microsoft Research Paraphrase
Corpus, 750 pairs), MSR (Video Microsoft Research
Video Description Corpus, 750 pairs), SMTeuroparl
(WMT2008 development dataset, Europarl section,
459 pairs), SMTnews (news conversation sentence
pairs from WMT, 399 pairs), and OnWN (pairs of
sentences from Ontonotes and WordNet definition,
750 pairs). Humans rated each pair with values from
0 to 5. The evaluation is performed by comparing
humans scores against systems performance through
Pearson?s correlation. The organizers propose three
different ways to aggregate values from the datasets:

puts for each dataset are fitted to the gold stan-

pairs in the dataset.
Experimental Setting. For the evaluation, we
built Distributional Spaces using the WaCkype-
dia_EN corpus2. WaCkypedia_EN is based on a
2009 dump of the English Wikipedia (about 800 mil-
lion tokens) and includes information about: part-of-
speech, lemma and a full dependency parsing per-
formed by MaltParser (Nivre et al, 2007). The three
spaces described in Section 2 are built exploiting
information about term windows and dependency
parsing supplied by WaCkypedia. The total number
of dependencies amounts to about 200 million.
The RI system is implemented in Java and re-
lies on some portions of code publicly available in
the Semantic Vectors package (Widdows and Fer-
raro, 2008), while for LSA we exploited the publicly
available C library SVDLIBC3.
We restricted the vocabulary to the 50,000 most
frequent terms, with stop words removal and forc-
ing the system to include terms which occur in the
dataset. Hence, the dimension of the original matrix
would have been 50,000?50,000.
2http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=corpora
3http://tedlab.mit.edu/ dr/SVDLIBC/
Our approach involves some parameters. In par-
ticular, each semantic space needs to set up the di-
mension k of the space. All spaces use a dimen-
sion of 500 (resulting in a 50,000?500 matrix). The
number of non-zero elements in the random vector
is set to 10. When we apply LSA to the output space
generated by the Random Indexing we hold all the
500 dimensions since during the tuning we observed
a drop in performance when a lower dimension was
set. The co-occurrence distance w between terms
was set up to 4.
In order to compute the similarity between the
vector representations of sentences we used the co-
sine similarity, and then we multiplied by 5 the ob-
tained value.
Results. Table 1 shows the overall results obtained
exploiting the different semantic spaces. We re-
port the three proposed evaluation measures with the
corresponding overall ranks with respect to the 89
runs submitted by participants. We submitted three
different runs, each exploring a different semantic
space: UNIBA-RI (based on Random Indexing),
UNIBA-LSARI (based on LSA performed over RI
outcome), and UNIBA-DEPRI (based on Random
Indexing and vector permutations). Each proposed
measure stresses different aspects. ALL is the Pear-
son?s correlation computed over the concatenated
dataset. As a consequence this measure ranks higher
systems which obtain consistent better results. Con-
versely, ALLNrm normalizes results by scaling val-
ues obtained from each dataset, in this way it tries
to give emphasis to systems trained on each dataset.
594
The result of these different perspective is that our
three spaces rank differently according to each mea-
sure. It seems that UNIBA-RI is able to work better
across all datasets, while UNIBA-LSARI gives the
best results on specific datasets, even though all our
methods are unsupervised and do not need training
steps. A deeper analysis on each dataset is reported
on Table 2. Here results seem to be at odds with
Table 1.
Considering individual datasets, UNIBA-RI gives
only once the best result, while UNIBA-LSARI and
UNIBA-DEPRI are able to provide the best results
twice. Generally, all results outperform the base-
line, based on a simple keyword overlap. Lower re-
sults are obtained in MSRpar, we ascribe this result
to the notably long sentences here involved. In par-
ticular, UNIBA-LSARI gives a result lower than the
baseline, and in line with the one obtained by LSA
during the tuning. Hence, we ascribe this low per-
formance to the application of LSA method to this
specific dataset. Only UNIBA-DEPRI was able to
outperform the baseline in this dataset. This shows
the usefulness of encoding syntactic features in se-
mantic word space where longer sentences are in-
volved. Generally, it is interesting to be noticed that
our spaces perform rather well on short and similarly
structured sentences, such as MSRvid and On-WN.
4 Conclusion
We reported evaluation results of our participation in
Semantic Textual Similarity task. Our systems ex-
ploit distributional models to represent the seman-
tics of words. Two of such spaces are based on a
classical definition of context, such as a fixed win-
dow of surrounding words. A third spaces tries to
encompass more definitions of context at once, as
the syntactic structure that relates words in a cor-
pus. Although simple, our methods have achieved
generally good results, outperforming the baseline
provided by the organizers.

Abstract
This paper describes the UNIBA participation
in the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) core
task 2013. We exploited three different sys-
tems for computing the similarity between two
texts. A system is used as baseline, which rep-
resents the best model emerged from our pre-
vious participation in STS 2012. Such system
is based on a distributional model of seman-
tics capable of taking into account also syn-
tactic structures that glue words together. In
addition, we investigated the use of two dif-
ferent learning strategies exploiting both syn-
tactic and semantic features. The former uses
ensemble learning in order to combine the
best machine learning techniques trained on
2012 training and test sets. The latter tries to
overcome the limit of working with different
datasets with varying characteristics by select-
ing only the more suitable dataset for the train-
ing purpose.
1 Introduction
Semantic Textual Similarity is the task of comput-
ing the similarity between any two given texts. The
task, in its core formulation, aims at capturing the
different kinds of similarity that emerge from texts.
Machine translation, paraphrasing, synonym substi-
tution or text entailment are some fruitful methods
exploited for this purpose. These techniques, along
with other methods for estimating the text similar-
ity, were successfully employed via machine learn-
ing approaches during the 2012 task.
However, the STS 2013 core task (Agirre et al,
2013) differs from the 2012 formulation in that it
provides a test set which is similar to the training,
but not drawn from the same set of data. Hence,
in order to generalize the machine learning models
trained on a group of datasets, we investigate the use
of combination strategies. The objective of combi-
nation strategies, known under the name of ensem-
ble learning, is that of reducing the bias-variance
decomposition through reducing the variance error.
Hence, this class of methods should be more ro-
bust with respect to previously unseen data. Among
the several ensemble learning alternatives, we ex-
ploit the stacked generalization (STACKING) algo-
rithm (Wolpert, 1992). Moreover, we investigate the
use of a two-steps learning algorithm (2STEPSML).
In this method the learning algorithm is trained us-
ing only the dataset most similar to the instance to
be predicted. The first step aims at predicting the
dataset more similar to the given pair of texts. Then
the second step makes use of the previously trained
algorithm to predict the similarity value. The base-
line for the evaluation is represented by our best sys-
tem (DSM PERM) resulting from our participation
in the 2012 task. After introducing the general mod-
els behind our systems in Section 2, Section 3 de-
scribes the evaluation setting of our systems along
with the experimental results. Then, some conclu-
sions and remarks close the paper.
2 General Models
2.1 Dependency Encoding via Vector
Permutations
Distributional models are effective methods for rep-
resenting word paradigmatic relations in a simple
169
way through vector spaces (Mitchell and Lapata,
2008). These spaces are built taking into account
the word context, hence the resulting vector repre-
sentation is such that the distance between vectors
reflects their similarity. Although several definitions
of context are possible (e.g. a sliding window of
text, the word order or syntactic dependencies), in
their plain definition these kinds of models account
for just one type of context at a time. To overcome
this limitation, we exploit a method to encode more
definitions of context in the same vector exploiting
the vector permutations (Caputo et al, 2012). This
technique, which is based on Random Indexing as
a means for computing the distributional model, is
based on the idea that when the components of a
highly sparse vector are shuffled, the resulting vec-
tor is nearly orthogonal to the original one. Hence,
vector permutation represents a way for generat-
ing new random vectors in a predetermined manner.
Different word contexts can be encoded using dif-
ferent types of permutations. In our distributional
model system (DSM PERM), we encode the syn-
tactic dependencies between words rather than the
mere co-occurrence information. In this way, word-
vector components bear the information about both
co-occurring and syntactically related words. In this
distributional space, a text can be easily represented
as the superposition of its words. Then, the vec-
tor representation of a text is given by adding the
vector representation of its words, and the similarity
between texts come through the cosine of the angle
between their vector representations.
2.2 Stacking
Stacking algorithms (Wolpert, 1992) are a way of
combining different types of learning algorithms re-
ducing the variance of the system. In this model,
the meta-learner tries to predict the real value of
an instance combining the outputs of other machine
learning methods.
Figure 1 shows how the learning process takes
place. The level-0 represents the ensemble of dif-
ferent models to be trained on the same dataset. The
level-0 outputs build up the level-1 dataset: an in-
stance at this level is represented by the numeric
values predicted by each level-0 model along with
the gold standard value. Then, the objective of the
level-1 learning model is to learn how to combine
the level-0 outputs in order to provide the best pre-
diction.

2.3 Two steps learning algorithm
Given an ensemble of datasets with different charac-
teristics, this method is based on the idea that when
instances come from a specific dataset, the learn-
ing algorithm trained on that dataset outperforms the
same algorithm trained on the whole ensemble.
Hence, the two steps algorithm tries to overcome
the problem of dealing with different datasets hav-
ing different characteristics through a classification
model.

In the first step (Figure 2), a different class is as-
signed to each dataset. The classifier is trained on
170
a set of instances whose classes correspond to the
dataset numbers. Then, given a new instance the
output of this step will be the dataset to be used
for training the learning algorithm in the step 2. In
the second step, the learning algorithm is trained on
the dataset choose in the first step. The output of
this step is the predicted similarity between the two
texts. Through these steps, it is possible to select
the dataset with the characteristics more similar to
a given instance, and exploit just this set of data for
learning the algorithm.
2.4 Features
Both STACKING and 2STEPSML systems rely on
several kinds of features, which vary from lexical to
semantic ones. Features are grouped in seven main
classes, as follows:
1. Character/string/annotation-based features:
the length of the longest common contiguous
substring between the texts; the Jaccard index
of both tokens and lemmas; the Levenshtein
distance between texts; the normalized number
of common 2-grams, 3-grams and 4-grams; the
total number of tokens and characters; the dif-
ference in tokens and characters between texts;
the normalized difference with respect to the
max text length in tokens and characters be-
tween texts. Exploiting other linguistic anno-
tations extracted by Stanford CoreNLP1, we
compute the Jaccard index between PoS-tags
and named entities. Using WordNet we extract
the Jaccard index between the first sense and its
super-sense tag.
2. Textual Similarity-based features: a set of fea-
tures based on the textual similarity proposed
by Mihalcea (Mihalcea et al, 2006). Given two
texts T1 and T2 the similarity is computed as
follows:
sim(T1, T2) =
1
2
(
?
w?T1 maxSim(w, T2)?
w?T1 idf(w)
+
?
w?T2 maxSim(w, T1)?
w?T2 idf(w)
)
(1)

We adopt several similarity measures using
semantic distributional models (see Section
2.5), the Resnik?s knowledge-based approach
(Resnik, 1995) and the point-wise mutual infor-
mation as suggested by Turney (Turney, 2001)
computed on British National Corpus2. For all
the features, the idf is computed relying on
UKWaC corpus3 (Baroni et al, 2009).
3. Head similarity-based features: this measure
takes into account the maximum similarity be-
tween the roots of each text. The roots are ex-
tracted using the dependency parser provided
by Stanford CoreNLP. The similarity is com-
puted according to the distributional semantic
models proposed in Section 2.5.
4. ESA similarity: computes the similarity
between texts using the Explicit Semantic
Analysis (ESA) approach (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007). For each text we extract the
ESA vector built using the English Wikipedia,
and then we compute the similarity as the co-
sine similarity between the two ESA vectors.
5. Paraphrasing features: this is a very simple
measure which counts the number of possi-
ble paraphrasings belonging to the two texts.
Given two texts T1 and T2, for each token in T1
a list of paraphrasings is extracted using a dic-
tionary4. If T2 contains one of the paraphrasing
in the list, the score is incremented by one. The
final score is divided by the number of tokens
in T1. The same score is computed taking into
account T2. Finally, the two score are added
and divided by 2.
6. Greedy Lemma Aligning Overlap features:
this measure computes the similarity between
texts using the semantic alignment of lemmas
as proposed by S?aric? et al (2012). In order
to compute the similarity between lemmas, we
exploit the distributional semantic models de-
scribed in Section 2.5.

7. Compositional features: we build several simi-
larity features using the distributional semantic
models described in Section 2.5 and a compo-
sitional operator based on sum. This approach
is thoroughly explained in Section 2.6
2.5 Distributional semantic models
In several features proposed in our approaches, the
similarity between words is computed using Dis-
tributional Semantic Models. These models repre-
sent word meanings through contexts: the different
meanings of a word can be accounted for by look-
ing at the different contexts wherein the word oc-
curs. This insight can beautifully be expressed by
the geometrical representation of words as vectors
in a semantic space. Each term is represented as a
vector whose components are contexts surrounding
the term. In this way, the meaning of a term across
a corpus is thoroughly conveyed by the contexts it
appears in, where a context may typically be the set
of co-occurring words in a document, in a sentence
or in a window of surrounding terms.
In particular, we take into account two main
classes of models: Simple Distributional Spaces and
Structured Semantic Spaces. The former considers
as context the co-occurring words, the latter takes
into account both co-occurrence and syntactic de-
pendency between words.
Simple Distributional Spaces rely on Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Random Indexing
(RI) in order to reduce the dimension of the co-
occurrences matrix. Moreover, we use an approach
which applies LSA to the matrix produced by RI.
Structured Semantic Spaces are based on two
techniques to encode syntactic information into the
vector space. The first approach uses the vector per-
mutation of random vector in RI to encode the syn-
tactic role (head or dependent) of a word. The sec-
ond method is based on Holographic Reduced Rep-
resentation, in particular using convolution between
vectors, to encode syntactic information.
Adopting distributional semantic models, each
word can be represented as a vector in a geomet-
ric space. The similarity between two words can be
easily computed taking into account the cosine sim-
ilarity between word vectors.
All models are described in Basile et al (2012).
2.6 Compositional features
In Distributional Semantic Models, given the vector
representations of two words, it is always possible
to compute their similarity as the cosine of the angle
between them.
However, texts are composed by several terms,
so in order to compute the similarity between them
we need a method to compose words occurring in
these texts. It is possible to combine words through
the vector addition (+). This operator is similar to
the superposition defined in connectionist systems
(Smolensky, 1990), and corresponds to the point-
wise sum of components:
p = u + v (2)
where pi = ui + vi
The addition is a commutative operator, which
means that it does not take into account any order
or underlying structures existing between words. In
this first study, we do not exploit more complex
methods to combine word vectors. We plan to in-
vestigate them in future work.
Given a text p, we denote with p its vector repre-
sentation obtained applying addition operator (+) to
the vector representation of terms it is composed of.
Furthermore, it is possible to compute the similar-
ity between two texts exploiting the cosine similarity
between vectors.
Formally, if a = a1, a2...an and b = b1, b2...bm
are two texts, we build two vectors a and b which
represent respectively the two texts in a semantic
space. Vector representations for the two texts are
built applying the addition operator to the vector rep-
resentation of words belonging to them:
a = a1 + a2 + . . . + an
b = b1 + b2 . . . + bm
(3)
The similarity between a and b is computed as the
cosine similarity between them.
3 Experimental evaluation
SemEval-2013 STS is the second attempt to provide
a ?unified framework for the evaluation of modular
semantic textual similarity and to characterize their
impact on NLP applications?. The task consists
in computing the similarity between pair of texts,
172
returning a similarity score. The test set is com-
posed by data coming from the following datasets:
news headlines (headlines); mapping of lexical re-
sources from Ontonotes to Wordnet (OnWN) and
from FrameNet to WordNet (FNWN); and evalua-
tion of machine translation (SMT).
The training data for STS-2013 is made up by
training and testing data from the previous edition
of STS-2012 task. During the 2012 edition, STS
provided participants with three training data: MSR-
Paraphrase, MSR-Video, STMeuropar; and five test-
ing data: MSR-Paraphrase, MSR-Video, STMeu-
ropar, SMTnews and OnWN. It is important to note
that part of 2012 test sets were made up from the
same sources of the training sets. On the other
hand, STS-2013 training and testing are very differ-
ent, making the prediction task a bit harder.
Humans rated each pair of texts with values from
0 to 5. The evaluation is performed by compar-
ing the humans scores against system performance
through Pearson?s correlation with the gold standard
for the four datasets.
3.1 System setup
For the evaluation, we built the distributional spaces
using the WaCkypedia EN corpus5. WaCkype-
dia EN is based on a 2009 dump of the English
Wikipedia (about 800 million tokens) and includes
information about: part-of-speech, lemma and a full
dependency parsing performed by MaltParser (Nivre
et al, 2007). The structured spaces described in
Subsections 2.1 and 2.5 are built exploiting infor-
mation about term windows and dependency pars-
ing supplied by WaCkypedia. The total number of
dependencies amounts to about 200 million.
The RI system is implemented in Java and re-
lies on some portions of code publicly available in
the Semantic Vectors package (Widdows and Fer-
raro, 2008), while for LSA we exploited the publicly
available C library SVDLIBC6.
We restricted the vocabulary to the 50,000 most
frequent terms, with stop words removal and forc-
ing the system to include terms which occur in the
dataset.
Semantic space building involves some parame-
5http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=corpora
6http://tedlab.mit.edu/ dr/SVDLIBC/
ters. In particular, each semantic space needs to set
up the dimension k of the space. All spaces use a
dimension of 500 (resulting in a 50,000?500 ma-
trix). The number of non-zero elements in the ran-
dom vector is set to 10. When we apply LSA to the
output space generated by the Random Indexing we
hold all the 500 dimensions, since during the tuning
we observed a drop in performance when a lower
dimension was set. The co-occurrence distance w
between terms was set up to 4.
In order to compute the similarity between
the vector representations of text using UNIBA-
DSM PERM, we used the cosine similarity, and
then we multiplied by 5 the obtained value.
The two supervised methods, UNIBA-2STEPML
and UNIBA-STACKING, are developed in Java
using Weka7 to implement the learning algo-
rithms. Regarding the stacking approach (UNIBA-
STACKING) we used for the level-0 the follow-
ing models: Gaussian Process with polynomial ker-
nel, Gaussian Process with RBF kernel, Linear Re-
gression, Support Vector regression with polynomial
kernel, and decision tree. The level-1 model uses
a Gaussian Process with RBF kernel. In the first
step of UNIBA-2STEPML we adopt Support Vec-
tor Machine, while in the second one we use Sup-
port Vector Machine for regression. In both steps,
the RBF-Kernel is used. Features are normalized
removing non alphanumerics characters. In all the
learning algorithms, we use the default parameters
set by Weka. As future work, we plan to perform a
tuning step in order to set the best parameters.
The choice of the learning algorithms for both
UNIBA-STACKING and UNIBA-2STEPSML sys-
tems was performed after a tuning phase where only
the STS-2012 training datasets were exploited. Ta-
ble 1 reports the values obtained by our three sys-
tems on the STS-2012 test sets. After the tuning,
we came up with the learning algorithms to employ
in the level-0 and level-1 of UNIBA-STACKING
and in step-1 and step-2 of UNIBA-2STEPSML.
Then, the training of both UNIBA-STACKING and
UNIBA-2STEPSML was performed on all STS-
2012 datasets (training and test data).

3.2 Evaluation results
Evaluation results on the STS-2013 data are reported
in Table 2. Among the three systems, UNIBA-
DSM PERM obtained the best performances on
both individual datasets and in the overall evalua-
tion metric (mean), which computes the Pearson?s
correlation considering all datasets combined in a
single one. The best system ranked 54 over a to-
tal of 90 submissions, while UNIBA-STACKING
and UNIBA-2STEPSML ranked 61 and 71 re-
spectively. These results are at odds with those
reported in Table 1. During the test on 2012
dataset, UNIBA-STACKING gave the best result,
followed by UNIBA-2STEPSML, while UNIBA-
DSM PERM gave the worst performance. The
UNIBA-STACKING system corroborated our hy-
pothesis giving also the best results on those datasets
not exploited during the training phase of the sys-
tem (OnWN, SMTnews). Conversely, UNIBA-
2STEPSML reported a different trend showing its
weakness with respect to a high variance in the data,
and performing worse than UNIBA-DSM PERM on
the OnWN and SMTnews datasets.
However, the evaluation results have refuted our
hypothesis, even with the use of the stacking sys-
tem. The independence from a training set makes
the UNIBA-DSM PERM system more robust than
other supervised algorithms, even though it is not
able to give always the best performance on individ-
ual datasets, as highlighted by results in Table 1.

4 Conclusions
This paper reports on UNIBA participation in Se-
mantic Textual Similarity 2013 core task. In this
task edition, we exploited both distributional mod-
els and machine learning techniques to build three
systems. A distributional model, which takes into
account the syntactic structure that relates words in a
corpus, has been used as baseline. Moreover, we in-
vestigate the use of two machine learning techniques
as a means to make our systems more independent
from the training data. However, the evaluation re-
sults have highlighted the higher robustness of the
distributional model with respect to these systems.

Abstract
This paper describes the UNIBA team
participation in the Cross-Level Semantic
Similarity task at SemEval 2014. We pro-
pose to combine the output of different se-
mantic similarity measures which exploit
Word Sense Disambiguation and Distribu-
tional Semantic Models, among other lex-
ical features. The integration of similar-
ity measures is performed by means of
two supervised methods based on Gaus-
sian Process and Support Vector Machine.
Our systems obtained very encouraging
results, with the best one ranked 6
th
out
of 38 submitted systems.
1 Introduction
Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (CLSS) is the
task of computing the similarity between two text
fragments of different sizes. The task focuses on
the comparison between texts at different lexical
levels, i.e. between a larger and a smaller text.
The task comprises four different levels: 1) para-
graph to sentence; 2) sentence to phrase; 3) phrase
to word; 4) word to sense. The task objective is
to provide a framework for evaluating general vs.
level-specialized methods.
Our general approach consists in combining
scores coming from different semantic similarity
algorithms. The combination is performed by a
supervised method using the training data pro-
vided by the task organizers. The data set com-
prises pairs of text fragments that can be rated with
a score between 0 and 4, where 4 indicates the
maximum level of similarity.
We select algorithms which provide similarities
at different levels of semantics: surface (or string-

based), lexical (word sense disambiguation), and
distributional level. The idea is to combine in a
unique system the semantic aspects that pertain
text fragments.
The following section gives more details about
the similarity measures and their combination in a
unique score through supervised methods (Section
2). Section 3 describes the system set up for the
evaluation and comments on the reported results,
while Section 4 concludes the paper.
2 System Description
The idea behind our system is to combine the
output of several similarity measures/features by
means of a supervised algorithm. Those features
were grouped in three main categories. The fol-
lowing three sub-sections describe in detail each
feature exploited by the system.
2.1 Distributional Semantics Level
Distributional Semantic Models (DSM) are an
easy way for building geometrical spaces of con-
cepts, also known as Semantic (or Word) Spaces,
by skimming through huge corpora of text in or-
der to learn the context of word usage. In the re-
sulting space, semantic relatedness/similarity be-
tween two words is expressed by the opposite of
the distance between points that represent those
words. Thus, the semantic similarity can be com-
puted as the cosine of the angle between the two
vectors that represent the words. This concept
of similarity can be extended to whole sentences
by combining words through vector addition (+),
which corresponds to the point-wise sum of the
vector components. Our DSM measure (DSM)
is based on a SemanticSpace, represented by a
co-occurrences matrix M , built by analysing the
distribution of words in the British National Cor-
pus (BNC). Then, M is reduced using the Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais,
1997). Vector addition and cosine similarity are
748
then used for building the vector representation of
each text fragment and computing their pairwise
similarity, respectively.
2.2 Lexical Semantics Level
Word Sense Disambiguation. Most of our
measures rely on the output of a Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (WSD) algorithm. Our newest ap-
proach to WSD, recently presented in Basile et
al. (2014), is based on the simplified Lesk algo-
rithm (Vasilescu et al., 2004). Each word w
i
in
a sequence w
1
w
2
...w
n
is disambiguated individ-
ually by choosing the sense that maximizes the
similarity between the gloss and the context of w
i
(i.e. the whole text where w
i
occurs). To boost
the overlap between the context and the gloss,
this last is expanded with glosses of related mean-
ings, following the approach described in Baner-
jee and Pedersen (2002). As sense inventory we
choose BabelNet 1.1, a huge multilingual seman-
tic network which comprises both WordNet and
Wikipedia (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). The al-
gorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Building the glosses. We retrieve all possible
word meanings for the target word w
i
that are
listed in BabelNet. BabelNet mixes senses
in WordNet and Wikipedia. First, senses
in WordNet are searched for; if no sense is
found (as often happens with named enti-
ties), senses for the target word are sought in
Wikipedia. We preferred that strategy rather
than retrieving senses from both sources at
once because this last approach produced
worse results when tuning the system. Once
the set of senses S
i
= {s
i1
, s
i2
, ..., s
ik
} as-
sociated to the target word w
i
has been re-
trieved, gloss expansion occurs. For each
sense s
ij
of w
i
, the algorithm builds the sense
extended gloss g
?
ij
by appending the glosses
of meanings related to s
ij
to its original gloss
g
ij
. The related meanings, with the exception
of ?antonym? senses, are the output of the
BabelNet function ?getRelatedMap?. More-
over, each word in g
?
ij
is weighted by a func-
tion inversely proportional to the distance be-
tween s
ij
and its related meaning. The dis-
tance d is computed as the number of edges
linking two senses in the graph. The func-
tion takes also into account the frequencies
of the words in all the glosses giving more
emphasis to the most discriminative words;
this can be considered as a variation of the in-
verse document frequency (idf ) for retrieval
that we named inverse gloss frequency (igf ).
The igf for a word w
k
occurring gf
?
k
times in
the set of extended glosses for all the senses
in S
i
, the sense inventory of w
i
, is computed
as IGF
k
= 1 + log

|S
i
|
gf
?
k
. The final weight
for the word w
k
appearing h times in the ex-
tended gloss g
?
ij
is given by:
weight(w
k
, g
?
ij
) = h? IGF
k
?
1
1 + d
(1)
2. Building the context. The context C for the
word w
i
is represented by all the words that
occur in the text.
3. Building the vector representations. The con-
text C and each extended gloss g
?
ij
are repre-
sented as vectors in the SemanticSpace built
through the DSM described in Subsection
2.1.
4. Sense ranking. The algorithm computes the
cosine similarity between the vector repre-
sentation of each extended gloss g
?
ij
and that
of the context C. Then, the cosine similar-
ity is linearly combined with the probability
p(s
ij
|w
i
), which takes into account the sense
distribution of s
ij
given the word w
i
. The
sense distribution is computed as the num-
ber of times the word w
i
was tagged with
the sense s
ij
in SemCor, a collection of 352
documents manually annotated with Word-
Net synsets. T he additive (Laplace) smooth-
ing prevents zero probabilities, which can oc-
cur when some synsets do not appear in Sem-
Cor. The probability is computed as follows:
p(s
ij
|w
i
) =
t(w
i
, s
ij
) + 1
#w
i
+ |S
i
|
(2)
The output of this step is a ranked list of
synsets.
The WSD measure (WSD) is computed on the top
of the output of the last step. For each text frag-
ment, we build a Bag-of-Synset (BoS) as the sum,
over the whole text, of the weighted synsets as-
sociated with each word. Then, we compute the
WSD similarity as the cosine similarity between
the two BoS.
749
Graph. A sub-graph of BabelNet is built for
each text fragment starting from the synsets pro-
vided by the WSD algorithm. For each word the
synset with the highest score is selected, then this
initial set is expanded with the related synsets in
BabelNet. We apply the Personalized Page Rank
(Haveliwala, 2002) to each sub-graph where the
synset scores computed by the WSD algorithm are
exploited as prior probabilities. The weighted rank
of synsets provided by Page Rank is used to build
the BoS of the two text fragments, then the Person-
alized Page Rank (PPR) is computed as the cosine
similarity between them.
Synset Distributional Space. Generally, sim-
ilarity measures between synsets rely on the
synsets hierarchy in a semantic network (e.g.
WordNet). We define a new approach that is com-
pletely different, and represents synsets as points
in a geometric space that we call SDS (Synset Dis-
tributional Space). SDS is generated taking into
account the synset relationships, and similarity is
defined as the synsets closeness in the space. We
build a symmetric matrix S which contains synsets
on both rows and columns. Each cell in the matrix
is set to one if a semantic relation exists between
the corresponding synsets. The relationships are
extracted from BabelNet limiting synsets to those
occurring also in WordNet, while synsets coming
from Wikipedia are removed to reduce the size
of S. The method for building the matrix S re-
lies on Reflective Random Indexing (RRI) (Co-
hen et al., 2010), a variation of the Random In-
dexing technique for matrix reduction (Kanerva,
1988). RRI retains the advantages of RI which
incrementally builds a reduced space where dis-
tance between points is nearly preserved. More-
over, cyclical training, i.e. the retraining of a new
space exploiting the RI output as basis vectors,
makes indirect inference to emerge. Two differ-
ent similarity measures can be defined by exploit-
ing this space for representing synsets: WSD-SDS
and PPR-SDS, based on WSD and PPR respec-
tively. Each BoS is represented as the sum of the
synset vectors in the SDS space. Then, the simi-
larity is computed as the cosine similarity between
the two vector representations.
2.3 Surface Level
At the surface level, we compute the following
features:
EDIT The edit, or Levenshtein, distance between
the two texts;
MCS The most common subsequence between
the two texts;
2-gram, 3-gram For each text fragment, we
build the Bag-of-n-gram (with n varying in
{2, 3}); then we compute the cosine similar-
ity between the two Bag-of-n-gram repre-
sentations.
BOW For each tokenized text fragment, we build
its Bag-of-Word, and then compute the co-
sine similarity between the two BoW.
L1 The length in characters of the first text frag-
ment;
L2 The length in caracters of the second text frag-
ment;
DIFF The difference between L1 and L2.
2.4 Word to Sense
The word to sense level is different from the other
ones: in this case the similarity is computed be-
tween a word and a particular word meaning.
Since a word meaning is not a text fragment, this
level poses a new challenge with respect to the
classical text similarity task. In this case we de-
cide to consider the word on its own as the first
text fragment, while for the second text fragment
we build a dummy text using the BabelNet gloss
assigned to the word sense. In that way, the distri-
butional and the lexical measures (WSD, Graph,
and DSM) can be applied to both fragments. Ta-
ble 1 recaps the features used for each task.
3 Evaluation
Dataset Description. The SemEval-2014 Task 3
Cross-Level Semantic Similarity is designed for
evaluating systems on their ability to capture the
semantic similarity between lexical items of dif-
ferent length (Jurgens et al., 2014). To this ex-
tent, the organizers provide four different levels
of comparison which correspond to four different
datasets: 1) Paragraph to Sentence (Par2Sent); 2)
Sentence to Phrase (Sent2Ph); 3) Phrase to Word
(Ph2W); and 4) Word to Sense (W2Sense).
For each dataset, the organizer released trial,
training and test data. While the trial includes a
few examples (approximately 40), both training
and test data comprise 500 pairs of text fragments.

Table 1: Features per task.
Each pair is associated with a human-assigned
similarity score, which varies from 4 (very similar)
to 0 (unrelated). Organizers provide the normal-
ized Longest Common Substring (LCS) as base-
line. The evaluation is performed through the
Pearson (official rank) and the Spearman?s rank
correlation.
System setup. We develop our system in JAVA
relying on the following resources:
? Stanford CoreNLP to pre-process the text:
tokenization, lemmatization and PoS-tagging
are applied to the two text fragments;
? BabelNet 1.1 as knowledge-base in the WSD
algorithm;
? JAVA JUNG library for Personalized Page
Rank;
? British National Corpus (tokenized text with
stop word removal) and SVDLIB to build the
SemanticSpace described in Subsection 2.1;
? A proprietary implementation of Reflective
Random Indexing to build the distributional
space based on synsets (SDS) extracted from
BabelNet (we used two cycles of retraining);
? Weka for the supervised approach.
After a tuning step using both training and trial
data provided by organizers, we selected three dif-
ferent supervised systems: Gaussian Process with
Puk kernel (run1), Gaussian Process with RBF
kernel (run2), and Support Vector Machine Re-
gression with Puk kernel (run3). All the sys-
tems are implemented with the default parame-
ters set by Weka. We trained a different model on
each dataset. The DSM is built using the 100, 000
most frequent terms in the BNC, while the co-
occurrences are computed on a window size of 5
words. The vector dimension is set to 400, the
same value is adopted for building the SDS, where
the number of seeds (no zero components) gener-
ated in the random vectors is set to 10 with one
step of retraining. The total number of synset vec-
tors in the SDS is 576, 736. In the WSD algorithm,
we exploited the whole sentence as context. The
linear combination between the cosine similarity
and the probability p(s
ij
|w
i
) is performed with a
factor of 0.5. The distance for expanding a synset
with its related meaning is set to one. The same
depth is used for building the graph in the PPR
method, where we fixed the maximum number of
iterations up to 50 and the dumpling factor to 0.85.
Results. Results of our three systems for
each similarity level are reported in Table 2 with
the baseline provided by the organizer (LCS).
Our three systems always outperform the LCS
baseline. Table 2 also shows the best results
(bestTrain) obtained on the training data by a
Gaussian Process with Puk kernel and a 10-fold
cross-validation. Support Vector Machine and
Gaussian Process with Puk kernel, run1 and run3
respectively, produce the same results. Comparing

these figures with those obtained on training data
(run1 and run3 vs. bestTrain), we can observe
that the Puk kernel tends to over-fit on training
data, while RBF kernel seems to be less sensitive
to this problem.
We analysed also the performance of each mea-
sure on its own; results in Table 3 are obtained by
training the best supervised system (run2) with
default parameters on each feature individually.
WSD obtains the best results in the first two lev-
els, while DSM is the best method in the last two
ones. This behaviour can be ascribed to the size
of the text fragments. In large text fragments the
WSD algorithm can rely on wider contexts to ob-
tain good performance; while in short texts infor-
mation about context is poor. At the W2Sense
level, the measure based on the Personalized Page
Rank obtains the worst results; however, we no-
ticed that the ablation of that feature causes a drop
in performance of the supervised systems.
After the submission deadline, we noticed that
sometimes PoS-tagging produced wrong results
on small texts. This incorrect behaviour influenced
negatively the correct retrieval of synsets from Ba-
belNet. Thus, we decided to exclude PoS-tagging
for text fragments with less than three words. In
such a case, all the synsets for a given word are
retrieved. Making this adjustment, we were able
to obtain the improvements (?%) with respect to
the submitted runs reported on Table 4.

4 Conclusions
We have reported the results of our participa-
tion in the cross-level semantic similarity task
of SemEval-2014. Our systems combine differ-
ent similarity measures based on string-matching,
word sense disambiguation and distributional se-
mantic models. Our best system ranks 6th out
of the 38 participants in the task with respect to
the Pearson correlation, while it ranks 8th when
Spearman was used. These results suggest that our
methods are robust with respect to the evaluation
measures.

Abstract
Distributional approaches are based on a sim-
ple hypothesis: the meaning of a word can be
inferred from its usage. The application of that
idea to the vector space model makes possi-
ble the construction of a WordSpace in which
words are represented by mathematical points
in a geometric space. Similar words are rep-
resented close in this space and the definition
of ?word usage? depends on the definition of
the context used to build the space, which can
be the whole document, the sentence in which
the word occurs, a fixed window of words,
or a specific syntactic context. However, in
its original formulation WordSpace can take
into account only one definition of context at
a time. We propose an approach based on
vector permutation and Random Indexing to
encode several syntactic contexts in a single
WordSpace. Moreover, we propose some op-
erations in this space and report the results
of an evaluation performed using the GEMS
2011 Shared Evaluation data.
1 Background and motivation
Distributional approaches usually rely on the
WordSpace model (Schu?tze, 1993). An overview
can be found in (Sahlgren, 2006). This model is
based on a vector space in which points are used to
represent semantic concepts, such as words.
The core idea behind WordSpace is that words
and concepts are represented by points in a math-
ematical space, and this representation is learned
from text in such a way that concepts with sim-
ilar or related meanings are near to one an-
other in that space (geometric metaphor of mean-
ing). The semantic similarity between concepts can
be represented as proximity in an n-dimensional
space. Therefore, the main feature of the geomet-
ric metaphor of meaning is not that meanings can
be represented as locations in a semantic space, but
rather that similarity between word meanings can be
expressed in spatial terms, as proximity in a high-
dimensional space.
One of the great virtues of WordSpaces is that
they make very few language-specific assumptions,
since just tokenized text is needed to build semantic
spaces. Even more important is their independency
of the quality (and the quantity) of available train-
ing material, since they can be built by exploiting an
entirely unsupervised distributional analysis of free
text. Indeed, the basis of the WordSpace model is
the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968), accord-
ing to which the meaning of a word is determined by
the set of textual contexts in which it appears. As a
consequence, in distributional models words can be
represented as vectors built over the observable con-
texts. This means that words are semantically related
as much as they are represented by similar vectors.
For example, if ?basketball? and ?tennis? occur fre-
quently in the same context, say after ?play?, they
are semantically related or similar according to the
distributional hypothesis.
Since co-occurrence is defined with respect to a
context, co-occurring words can be stored into ma-
trices whose rows represent the terms and columns
represent contexts. More specifically, each row cor-
responds to a vector representation of a word. The
strength of the semantic association between words
43
can be computed by using cosine similarity.
A weak point of distributional approaches is that
they are able to encode only one definition of con-
text at a time. The type of semantics represented in
WordSpace depends on the context. If we choose
documents as context we obtain a semantics differ-
ent from the one we would obtain by selecting sen-
tences as context. Several approaches have inves-
tigated the above mentioned problem: (Baroni and
Lenci, 2010) use a representation based on third-
order tensors and provide a general framework for
distributional semantics in which it is possible to
represent several aspects of meaning using a sin-
gle data structure. (Sahlgren et al, 2008) adopt
vector permutations as a means to encode order in
WordSpace, as described in Section 2. BEAGLE
(Jones and Mewhort, 2007) is a very well-known
method to encode word order and context informa-
tion in WordSpace. The drawback of the BEAGLE
model is that it relies on a complex model to build
vectors which is computational expensive. This
problem is solved by (De Vine and Bruza, 2010)
in which the authors propose an approach similar
to BEAGLE, but using a method based on Circu-
lar Holographic Reduced Representations to com-
pute vectors.
All these methods tackle the problem of repre-
senting word order in WordSpace, but they do not
take into account syntactic context. A valuable at-
tempt in this direction is described in (Pado? and La-
pata, 2007). In this work, the authors propose a
method to build WordSpace using information about
syntactic dependencies. In particular, they consider
syntactic dependencies as context and assign dif-
ferent weights to each kind of dependency. More-
over, they take into account the distance between
two words into the graph of dependencies. The re-
sults obtained by the authors support our hypothesis
that syntactic information can be useful to produce
effective WordSpace. Nonetheless, their methods
are not able to directly encode syntactic dependen-
cies into the space.
This work aims to provide a simple approach to
encode syntactic relations dependencies directly into
the WordSpace, dealing with both the scalability
problem and the possibility to encode several con-
text information. To achieve that goal, we devel-
oped a strategy based on Random Indexing and vec-
tor permutations. Moreover, this strategy opens new
possibilities in the area of semantic composition as
a result of the inherent capability of encoding rela-
tions between words.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes Random Indexing, the strategy for build-
ing our WordSpace, while details about the method
used to encode syntactic dependencies are reported
in Section 3. Section 4 describes the formal defi-
nition of some operations over the WordSpace and
shows a first attempt to define a model for semantic
composition. Finally, the results of the evaluation
performed using the GEMS 2011 Shared Evaluation
data1 is presented in Section 5, while conclusions
are reported in Section 6.
2 Random Indexing
We exploit Random Indexing (RI), introduced by
Kanerva (Kanerva, 1988), for creating a WordSpace.
This technique allows us to build a WordSpace with
no need for (either term-document or term-term)
matrix factorization, because vectors are inferred by
using an incremental strategy. Moreover, it allows
to solve efficiently the problem of reducing dimen-
sions, which is one of the key features used to un-
cover the ?latent semantic dimensions? of a word
distribution.
RI is based on the concept of Random Projection
according to which high dimensional vectors chosen
randomly are ?nearly orthogonal?.
Formally, given an n ?m matrix A and an m ?
k matrix R made up of k m-dimensional random
vectors, we define a new n? k matrix B as follows:
Bn,k = An,m?Rm,k k << m (1)
The new matrix B has the property to preserve
the distance between points. This property is known
as Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: if the distance be-
tween two any points of A is d, then the distance dr
between the corresponding points in B will satisfy
the property that dr = c ? d. A proof of that property
is reported in (Dasgupta and Gupta, 1999).
Specifically, RI creates a WordSpace in two steps
(in this case we consider the document as context):
1Available on line:
http://sites.google.com/site/geometricalmodels/shared-
evaluation
44
1. a context vector is assigned to each document.
This vector is sparse, high-dimensional and
ternary, which means that its elements can take
values in {-1, 0, 1}. A context vector contains a
small number of randomly distributed non-zero
elements, and the structure of this vector fol-
lows the hypothesis behind the concept of Ran-
dom Projection;
2. context vectors are accumulated by analyzing
terms and documents in which terms occur. In
particular, the semantic vector for a term is
computed as the sum of the context vectors for
the documents which contain that term. Con-
text vectors are multiplied by term occurrences.
Formally, given a collection of documents D
whose vocabulary of terms is V (we denote with
dim(D) and dim(V ) the dimension of D and V ,
respectively) the above steps can be formalized as
follows:
1. ?di ? D, i = 0, .., dim(D) we built the cor-
respondent randomly generated context vector
as:
??rj = (ri1, ..., rin) (2)
where n  dim(D), ri? ? {?1, 0, 1} and
??rj
contains only a small number of elements dif-
ferent from zero;
2. the WordSpace is made up of all term vectors
??
tj where:
??
tj = tfj
?
di?D
tj?di
??ri (3)
and tfj is the number of occurrences of tj in
di;
By considering a fixed window W of terms as
context, the WordSpace is built as follows:
1. a context vector is assigned to each term;
2. context vectors are accumulated by analyzing
terms in which terms co-occur in a window W .
In particular, the semantic vector for each term
is computed as the sum of the context vectors
for terms which co-occur in W .
It is important to point out that the classical RI
approach can handle only one context at a time, such
as the whole document or the window W .
A method to add information about context in RI
is proposed in (Sahlgren et al, 2008). The authors
describe a strategy to encode word order in RI by the
permutation of coordinates in random vector. When
the coordinates are shuffled using a random permu-
tation, the resulting vector is nearly orthogonal to the
original one. That operation corresponds to the gen-
eration of a new random vector. Moreover, by apply-
ing a predetermined mechanism to obtain random
permutations, such as elements rotation, it is always
possible to reconstruct the original vector using the
reverse permutations. By exploiting this strategy it is
possible to obtain different random vectors for each
context2 in which the term occurs. Let us consider
the following example ?The cat eats the mouse?. To
encode the word order for the word ?cat? using a
context window W = 3, we obtain:
< cat >= (??1the) + (?+1eat)+
+(?+2the) + (?+3mouse)
(4)
where ?nx indicates a rotation by n places of the
elements in the vector x. Indeed, the rotation is per-
formed by n right-shifting steps.
3 Encoding syntactic dependencies
Our idea is to encode syntactic dependencies, in-
stead of words order, in the WordSpace using vector
permutations.
A syntactic dependency between two words is de-
fined as:
dep(head, dependent) (5)
where dep is the syntactic link which connects
the dependent word to the head word. Gener-
ally speaking, dependent is the modifier, object or
complement, while head plays a key role in de-
termining the behavior of the link. For example,
subj(eat, cat) means that ?cat? is the subject of
?eat?. In that case the head word is ?eat?, which
plays the role of verb.
The key idea is to assign a permutation function
to each kind of syntactic dependencies. Formally,
2In the case in point the context corresponds to the word
order
45
let D be the set of all dependencies that we take into
account. The function f : D ? ? returns a schema
of vector permutation for each dep ? D. Then, the
method adopted to construct a semantic space that
takes into account both syntactic dependencies and
Random Indexing can be defined as follows:
1. a context vector is assigned to each term, as de-
scribed in Section 2 (Random Indexing);
2. context vectors are accumulated by analyzing
terms which are linked by a dependency. In
particular the semantic vector for each term ti
is computed as the sum of the permuted con-
text vectors for the terms tj which are depen-
dents of ti and the inverse-permuted vectors
for the terms tj which are heads of ti. The
permutation is computed according to f . If
f(d) = ?n the inverse-permutation is defined
as f?1(d) = ??n: the elements rotation is per-
formed by n left-shifting steps.
Adding permuted vectors to the head word and
inverse-permuted vectors to the corresponding de-
pendent word allows to encode the information
about both heads and dependents into the space.
This approach is similar to the one investigated by
(Cohen et al, 2010) to encode relations between
medical terms.
To clarify, we provide an example. Given the fol-
lowing definition of f :
f(subj) = ?+3 f(obj) = ?+7 (6)
and the sentence ?The cat eats the mouse?, we obtain
the following dependencies:
det(the, cat) subj(eat, cat)
obj(eat,mouse) det(the,mouse)
(7)
The semantic vector for each word is computed as:
? eat:
< eat >= (?+3cat) + (?+7mouse) (8)
? cat:
< cat >= (??3eat) (9)
? mouse:
< mouse >= (??7eat) (10)
In the above examples, the function f does not
consider the dependency det.
4 Query and vector operations
In this section, we propose two types of queries
that allow us to compute semantic similarity be-
tween two words exploiting syntactic dependencies
encoded in our space. Before defining query and
vector operations, we introduce a small set of nota-
tions:
? R denotes the original space of random vectors
generated during the WordSpace construction;
? S is the space of terms built using our strategy;
? rti ? R denotes the random vector of the term
ti;
? sti ? S denotes the semantic vector of the term
ti;
? sim(v1, v2) denotes the similarity between two
vectors; in our approach we adopt cosine simi-
larity;
? ?dep is the permutation returned from f(dep).
??dep is the inverse-permutation.
The first family of queries is dep(ti, ?). The idea
is to find all the dependents which are in relation
with the head ti, given the dependency dep. The
query can be computed as follows:
1. retrieve the vector sti from S;
2. for each rtj ? R compute the similarity be-
tween sti and < ?
deprtj >:
sim(sti , < ?
deprtj >);
3. rank in descending order all tj according to the
similarity computed in step 2.
The idea behind this operation is to compute how
each possible dependent tj contributes to the vector
ti, which is the sum of all the dependents related to
ti. It is important to note that we must first apply the
permutation to each rtj in order to take into account
the dependency relation (context). This operation
has a semantics different from performing the query
by applying first the inverse permutation to ti in R
and then computing the similarity with respect to all
the vectors tj in S. Indeed, the last approach would
46
compute how the head ti contributes to the vector tj ,
which differs from the goal of our query.
Using the same approach it is possible to compute
the query dep(?, tj), in which we want to search all
the heads related to the dependent tj fixed the de-
pendency dep. In detail:
1. retrieve the vector stj from S;
2. for each rti ? R compute the similarity be-
tween stj and the inverse-permutation of rti ,
< ??deprti >: sim(stj , < ?
?deprti >);
3. rank in descending order all ti according to the
similarity computed in step 2.
In this second query, we compute how the inverse-
permutation of each ti (head) affects the vector stj ?
S. In the following sub-section we provide some
initial idea about semantic composition.
4.1 Compositional semantics
Distributional approaches represent words in isola-
tion and they are typically used to compute similar-
ities between words. They are not able to represent
complex structures such as phrases or sentences. In
some applications, such as Question Answering and
Text Entailment, representing text by single words is
not enough. These applications would benefit from
the composition of words in more complex struc-
tures. The strength of our approach lies on the ca-
pability of codify syntactic relations between words
overcoming the ?word isolation? issue.
A lot of recent work argue that tensor product (?)
could be useful to combine word vectors. In (Wid-
dows, 2008) some preliminary investigations about
product and tensor product are provided, while an
interesting work by Clark and Pulman (Clark and
Pulman, 2007) proposes an approach to combine
symbolic and distributional models. The main idea
is to use tensor product to combine these two as-
pects, but the authors do not describe a method to
represent symbolic features, such as syntactic de-
pendencies. Conversely, our approach is able to en-
code syntactic information directly into the distri-
butional model. The authors in (Clark and Pulman,
2007) propose a strategy to represent a sentence like
?man reads magazine? by tensor product:
man? subj ? read? obj ?magazine (11)
They also propose a solid model for composition-
ality, but they do not provide a strategy to repre-
sent symbolic relations, such as subj and obj. They
wrote: ?How to obtain vectors for the dependency
relations - subj, obj, etc. - is an open question?. We
believe that our approach can tackle this problem by
encoding the dependency directly in the space, be-
cause each semantic vector in our space contains in-
formation about syntactic roles.
The representation based on tensor product is
useful to compute sentence similarity. Given the
previous sentence and the following one ?woman
browses newspaper?, we want to compute the sim-
ilarity between the two sentences. The sentence
?woman browses newspaper?, using the composi-
tional model, is represented by:
woman?subj?browse?obj?newspaper (12)
Computing the similarity of two representations
by inner product is a complex task, but exploiting
the following property of the tensor product:
(w1?w2) ?(w3?w4) = (w1 ?w3)?(w2 ?w4) (13)
the similarity between two sentences can be com-
puted by taking into account the pairs in each depen-
dency and multiplying the inner products as follows:
man ? woman? read ? browse?
?magazine ? newspaper
(14)
According to the property above mentioned, we
can compute the similarity between sentences with-
out using the tensor product. However, some open
questions arise. This simple compositional strategy
allows to compare sentences which have similar de-
pendency trees. For example, the sentence ?the dog
bit the man? cannot can be compared to ?the man
was bitten by the dog?. This problem can be easily
solved by identifying active and passive forms of a
verb. When two sentences have different trees, Clark
and Pulman (Clark and Pulman, 2007) propose to
adopt the convolution kernel (Haussler, 1999). This
strategy identifies all the possible ways of decom-
posing the two trees, and sums up the similarities be-
tween all the pairwise decompositions. It is impor-
tant to point out that, in a more recent work, Clark
47
et al (Clark et al, 2008) propose a model based
on (Clark and Pulman, 2007) combined with a com-
positional theory for grammatical types, known as
Lambek?s pregroup semantics, which is able to take
into account grammar structures. It is important to
note that this strategy is not able to encode gram-
matical roles into the WordSpace. This peculiarity
makes our approach completely different. In the fol-
lowing section we provide some examples of com-
positionality.
5 Evaluation
The goal of the evaluation is twofold: proving the
capability of our approach by means of some exam-
ples and providing results of the evaluation exploit-
ing the ?GEMS 2011 Shared Evaluation?, in particu-
lar the compositional semantics dataset. We propose
two semantic spaces built from two separate corpora
using our strategy. To achieve the first goal we pro-
vide several examples for each family of queries de-
scribed in Section 4. Concerning the second goal,
we evaluate our approach to compositional seman-
tics using the dataset proposed by Mitchell and Lap-
ata (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), which is part of the
?GEMS 2011 Shared Evaluation?. The dataset is a
list of two pairs of adjective-noun combinations or
verb-object combinations or compound nouns. Hu-
mans rated pairs of combinations according to simi-
larity. The dataset contains 5,833 rates which range
from 1 to 7. Examples of pairs follow:
support offer help provide 7
old person right hand 1
where the similarity between offer-support and
provide-help (verb-object) is higher than the one be-
tween old-person and right-hand (adjective-noun).
As suggested by the authors, the goal of the eval-
uation is to compare the system performace against
humans scores by means of Spearman correlation.
5.1 System setup
The system is implemented in Java and relies on
some portions of code publicly available in the
Semantic Vectors package (Widdows and Ferraro,
2008). For the evaluation of the system, we build
two separate WordSpaces using the following cor-
pora: ukWaC (Baroni et al, 2009) and TASA.
ukWaC contains 2 billion words and it is constructed
from the Web by limiting the crawling to the .uk
domain and using medium-frequency words from
the BNC corpus as seeds. We use only a por-
tion of ukWaC corpus consisting of 7,025,587 sen-
tences (about 220,000 documents). The TASA cor-
pus (compiled by Touchstone Applied Science As-
sociates) was kindly made available to us by Prof.
Thomas Landauer from the University of Colorado.
The TASA corpus contains a collection of English
texts that is approximately equivalent to what the av-
erage college-level student has read in his/her life-
time. The TASA corpus consists of about 800,000
sentences.
To extract syntactic dependencies, we adopt
MINIPAR3 (Lin, 2003). MINIPAR is an efficient
English parser, which is suitable for parsing a large
amount of data. The total amount of extracted de-
pendencies is about 112,500,000 for ukWaC and
8,850,000 for TASA.
Our approach involves some parameters. We set
the random vector dimension to 4,000 and the num-
ber of non-zero elements in the random vector equal
to 10. We restrict the WordSpace to the 40,000 most
frequent words4. Another parameter is the set of de-
pendencies that we take into account. In this prelim-
inary investigation we consider the four dependen-
cies described in Table 1, that reports also the kind
of permutation5 applied to vectors.
5.2 Results
In this section we report some results of queries per-
formed in ukWaC and TASA corpus.
Table 2 and Table 3 report the results respectively
for the queries dep(ti, ?) and dep(?, tj). The effects
of encoding syntactic information is clearly visible,
as can be inferred by results in the tables. Moreover,
the results with the two corpora are different, as ex-
pected, but in many cases the first result of the query
is the same.
Our space can be also exploited to perform classi-
cal queries in which we want to find ?similar? words.
Tables 4 and 5 report results for TASA and ukWaC
3MINIPAR is available at
http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/?lindek/minipar.htm
4Word frequency is computed taking into account the se-
lected dependencies.
5The number of rotations is randomly chosen.

Dependency Description Permutation

subj subject of verbs ?+3

Table 1: The set of dependencies used in the evaluation.
corpus, respectively. The results obtained by similar
test are not the typical results expected by classical
WordSpace. In fact, in Table 5 the word most simi-
lar to ?good? is ?bad?, because they are used in the
same syntactic context, but have opposite meaning.
The similarity between words in our space strongly
depends on their syntactic role. For example, the
words similar to ?food? are all the nouns which are
object/subject of the same verbs in syntactic relation
with ?food?.
Finally, we provide the results of semantic com-
position. Table 6 reports the Spearman correlation
between the output of our system and the mean
similarity scores given by the humans. The table
shows results for each types of combination: verb-
object, adjective-noun and compound nouns. To per-
form the experiment on compound nouns, we re-
build the spaces encoding the ?nn? relation provided
by MINIPAR which refers to compound nouns de-
pendency. Table 6 shows the best result obtained
by Mitchell and Lapata (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)
using the same dataset. Our method is able to out-
perform MLbest and obtains very high results when
adjective-noun combination is involved.

Table 6: GEMS 2011 Shared Evaluation results.
The experiments reported in this preliminary eval-
uation are only a small fraction of the experiments
that are required to make a proper evaluation of the
effectiveness of our semantic space and to compare
it with other approaches. This will be the main fo-
cus of our future research. The obtained results seem
to be encouraging and the strength of our approach,
capturing syntactic relations, allows to implement
several kind of queries using only one WordSpace.
We believe that the real advantage of our approach,
that is the possibility to represent several syntactic
relations, has much room for exploration.
6 Conclusions
In this work, we propose an approach to encode syn-
tactic dependencies in WordSpace using vector per-
mutations and Random Indexing. In that space, a set
of operations is defined, which relies on the possibil-
ity of exploiting syntactic dependencies to perform
some particular queries, such as the one for retriev-
ing all similar objects of a verb. We propose an early
attempt to use that space for semantic composition
of short sentences. The evaluation using the GEMS
2011 shared dataset provides encouraging results,
but we believe that there are open points which de-
serve more investigation. We planned a deeper eval-
uation of our WordSpace and a more formal study
about semantic composition.
